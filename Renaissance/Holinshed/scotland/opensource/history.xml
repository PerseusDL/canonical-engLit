<p>IT may seeme (Right Honorable) a great presumption in mee, to haue taken
in hand the collection of this Scotish historic, and other of diuers regions,
considering so many sufficient men as liue in these daies, farre more able to
performe the same. But where at the motion of a speciall friend, I vndertooke to deale therein, more vpon trust of his promised aid than of mine
owne abilitie, it pleased GOD to call him to his mercie before the worke
could be fullie brought to an end: but yet to answer the expectation of his
friends, and trust which he had committed to them and me in this behalfe,
I haue doone my good will to accomplish part of that, which in his life time
was intended, although not to my wished desire, by reason of such wants as
had beene supplied if he had liued to haue seene it published himselfe.</p>
<p>It resteth (right noble Earle) that it may please your Honor to accept my
dooings in good part, to whom I offer this parcell of my trauels in this historie of Scotland, in regard of the honor due to your noble father, for his
incomparable valure well knowne and approoued, as well within that realme
as else-where in seruice of two kings of most famous memorie, Henrie the
eight &amp; Edward the sixt, sounding so greatlie to his renowme, as the same
cannot passe in silence, whilest any remembrance of those two most peerelesse princes shall remaine in written histories. I therefore most humblie
beseech your Honor, to beare with my boldnesse in presenting you with so

those, to whome I reckon my selfe most beholden. As what is he within
this realme almost of anie degree, which findeth not himselfe bounden to your
Honor, either in his owne causes or his friends? For such is your inclination to pleasure all men, as the same may seeme a peculiar vertue planted

thought by your Honor better spent, than that which you employ in dooing
good to others.</p>
<p>But least I should enter into so large a discourse, as might be framed of
this and other your excellent vertues (a matter far exceeding my simple
knowledge) I will ceasse to speake further thereof, sith the same is spread

of such as haue abundantlie tasted of your exceeding courtesies. In making
you owner therefore of this abstract of the Scotish histories, I most humblie
beseech your Honor, if anie thing be amisse, to impute the same to the imperfection and defect of better instructions, and with your benigne and fauorable interpretation to haue me therein excused. Such as it is, I addresse

	    <head>[Introduction]</head>
<p>THE Scotish men, according to the maner of other nations, est&eacute;eming it a glorie to fetch
their begining of great anciencie, say that their originall descent cam fr&omacr; the Gr&eacute;eks
and Aegyptians: for there was (as the old Scotish historiographers haue left in writing) a
certeine noble man among the Gr&eacute;eks, named Gathelus, the sonne of Cecrops, who builded
<note place="marg">Gathelus.</note>
the citie of Athens: or as some other would, he was the sonne of Argus Nealus, the fourth
king of the Argiues. This Gathelus plaieng in his youth manie wild and vnrulie parts in
<note place="marg">Gathelus giuen to will and pleasure.</note>
the countrie of Macedonia and Achaia, was diuers times sharplie rebuked by his father and
other of his friends: so that in fine disdaining their correction and wholsome admonitions,
he was banished by his father: after which he got togither a number of strong and lustie
yoong men, such as had vsed the like trade of liuing, and with them fled ouer into Aegypt;
<note place="marg">Gathelus went into Aegypt, <emph>Anno mundi 2416.</emph></note>

<note place="marg">Gathelus was interteined of Pharao.</note>

<note place="marg">Gathelus went against the enimies.</note>

<note place="marg">Moses capteine generall vnder Pharao.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Ios. lib. 2. cap. 7.</emph></note>

<note place="marg">Gathelus his dooings aduanced.</note>

<note place="marg">Moses dooings not alowed.</note>
and comming thither in the 33 yeare of Pharao Orus as then king of that countrie, was receiued of him in most gladsome wise, for that his seruice (as was thought) might stand in
great stead in those warres, which the Aegyptians held at that time with the Aethiopians
that had inuaded the realme of Aegypt, euen vnto Memphis. This Gathelus, to be short,
went forth with his bands against the same Aethiopians, vnder Moses the capteine generall
of the armie, chosen thereto by diuine oracle (as Iosephus writeth) which Moses obteined
the victorie, and conquered Saba by force being the chiefest and principall citie which stood
in the Ile Meroe.</p>
<p>For such tokens of valiancie and worthie prowesse as Gathelus shewed, both in this countrie, and in other places, he grew also into such estimation with Pharao, that he gaue him his
daughter in mariage. But Moses was rather enuied than honored for his dooing, because
the Aegyptians doubted least the Israelites should increase to such a puissant multitude, that
in the end they might vsurpe and challenge the gouernance of the whole realme, and bring
it by rebelling into their owne hands: wherefore diuers informations were made to the king
against him, so that when he once perceiued himselfe to be in danger of the lawe, and
looked for no mercie at their hands, he fled from thence out of the countrie, &amp; gat him into
<note place="marg">Moses fled.</note>

<note place="marg">The citie of Thebes was giuen vnto Gathelus.</note>

<note place="marg">Scota daughter to Pharao.</note>
the land of Madian. Vnto Gathelus and his people there was giuen a citie called Thebes
[Aegyptiaca] b&eacute;eing taken from the Israelites. &para; Here you must vnderstand, that Pharaos
daughter which Gathelus thus maried, was called Scota, of whome such as came of the
posteritie of that nation were afterwards, and are at this present day called <emph>Scoti,</emph> that is to
say Scotishmen, and the land where they inhabit <emph>Scotia,</emph> that is to say, Scotland.</p>
<p>Gathelus thus being aduanced by such honorable mariage, liued all the daies of his father
<note place="marg">The credit of this historie of Gathelus we leaue to the authors.</note>

<note place="marg">Israel oppressed.</note>
in law Pharao Orus, in great honor. But after his deceasse, and in the third generation, an
other king named Pharao Chencres succeeded in his throne, who oppressed the people of
Israell then abiding in Aegypt, with more bondage than euer his father or grandfather had
doone before him. Neither was there hope of anie redresse, till Moses returned by Gods

appointment from amongst the Madianites (where he had remained in exile) into Aegypt,
<note place="marg">Moses called out of Madian into Aegypt.</note>
and there declared vnto this Pharao, Gods commandement, touching the deliuerance of his
people.</p>
<p>But forsomuch as his words were regarded, neither with the king, nor with his subjects,
<note place="marg">Moses not regarded.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Exodus 5.</emph></note>
that land was plagued in most horrible maner; and moreouer it was signified vnto such as
sought to know what was meant by way of oracles, that sorer and more grieuous plagues

<note place="marg">Gathelus leauing Aegypt, s&eacute;eketh other countries.</note>
should after follow, if remedie were not found the sooner. Gathelus therefore being certified hereof, and giuing credit to the oracles aforesaid, determined out of hand to forsake
the countrie, and s&eacute;eke him a new place of abode in some other parties of the world.
Wherefore he caused a number of ships to be rigged, and all necessarie puruciance to be
prouided, and when the same was once readie, and all things set in order, he tooke with
him his wife and children, and a great multitude of people both Gr&eacute;ekes and Aegyptians,
<note place="marg">Gathelus departing was, <emph>Anno mundi, 2453. W. H. 3643. II. B.</emph></note>

<note place="marg">He was repelled from Barbarie.</note>

<note place="marg">He landed in Portingale.</note>
whom he imbarked in those ships, and hoising vp sailes, departed out of the mouth of the
riuer Nilus, in the yeare of the worlds creation 2453, when he had dwelled in Aegypt 39
yeares and more. Being thus departed, after some trouble in the voiage, they arriued first
on the coasts of Numidia, which is one of the regions of Affrike, now called Barbarie: but
being put backe from thence by the stout resistance of the inhabitants, they tooke the seas
againe, and landed in a part of Spaine, which long after was called Lusitania.</p>
<p>There be that haue written how it should be cleped port Gathele of this Gathelus, and
certeine yeares after Lusitania, and eftsoones againe in a maner to haue got the former
name, being somewhat corruptlie called Portingale. But who is able in a matter of such
anciencie to auouch anie thing for truth?</p>
<p>Gathelus with his companie being thus come to land, sought abroad in the countrie for
victuals, and such other necessarie things as they wanted (for their long being on the seas
had wasted all their purueiance:) whose arriuall being once knowne in the countrie, the
people assembled togither, and fiercely incountring with the strangers, after sharpe and cruell
<note place="marg">Theinhabitants resist Gathelus.</note>
fight, in the end the Spaniards were put to the woorst and chased out of the field. This
victorie put Gathelus and his folks in hope of good successe to haue there a place for them
to inhabit in, and so to end their long wandering in strange and vncerteine places. And to
the intent they might bring their purpose the more easilie to passe, they found means by
way of communication to ioine in friendship with the Spaniards, and obteining of them a
<note place="marg">A communication.</note>

<note place="marg">Gathelus buildeth the citie Bracchara.</note>
plot where they might build a place for to inhabit in; shortlie after they began the foundation
of a citie n&eacute;ere to the banks of the riuer called of ancient time Mundus, and afterwards
Bracchara.</p>
<p>It chanced after this, that the Spaniards (perceiuing these strangers to increase further in
puissance than, as they thought, stood well with their securitie) sought diuerse occasions to
fall at debate with them, and to make warres vpon them: but when they vnderstood that

<note place="marg">A communication.</note>
Gathelus was as readie to defend, as they were to inuade, they eftsoones fell to a communication, &amp; persuaded with Gathelus, that it should be best for him and his people, for the
auoiding of variance, to remooue vnto the northside of Spaine, lieng vpon the coasts of the
Cantabrian seas, now called Galitia (where he should find much void ground, by reason
of the small number of inhabitants) adding that if they would so doo, they would aid them
to the vttermost against all such as should attempt to disquiet their indeuours in anie maner
<note place="marg">Gathelus left Po tingale, and went into Galitia.</note>

<note place="marg">He builded a citie called Brigantia, and now Compostella.</note>
of wise. This offer Gathelus gladlie accepted, and causing publike sacrifice to be celebrated
in honor of the gods, he departed with all his people into Galitia, and there concluding a
league with the inhabitants, builded a citie which he named Brigantia, but after it was
named Nouium, and now Compostella</p>

with good and holsome statutes and ordinances, the chiefest fortifications that may be for all
cities and countries. And bicause he would not onelie haue his said people to liue vnder
one law, but also to be knowne and called by one name, he gaue commandement that they
should be all called Scotishmen (as before is said) of his wife Scota. In continuance of
time, this nation grew to a woonderfull multitude, so that the Spaniards doubting the woorst,
<note place="marg">The Spaniards fight with the Scots infortunatlie.</note>
determined to fores&eacute;e remedie in time, and herevpon purposing vtterlie to destroie them,
got them againe to armour, and with their whole puissance comming vpon the Scotishmen,
gaue them a sore battell, though in the end they were put to flight, the victorie remaining
with the Scotishmen, albeit not without great bloudshed on either part, as the Scotish historie
saieth. At length a necessarie peace was agr&eacute;ed vpon betwixt both parties, the conditions
<note place="marg">A peace concluded.</note>
whereof were these: that aswell Scotishmen as Spaniards should liue after their owne lawes,
and neither of them to inuade other.</p>
<p>Gathelus hauing peace thus with his neighbors, sat vpon his marble stone in Brigantia,
<note place="marg">Gathelus ministred iustice.</note>

<note place="marg">A description of the seat.</note>
where he gaue lawes, and ministred iustice vnto his people, thereby to mainteine them in
wealth and quietnesse. This stone was in fashion like a seat or chaire, hauing such a fatall
destinie, as the Scots say, following it, that wheresoeuer it should be found, there should
the Scotishmen reigne and haue the supreme gouernance. Hereof it came to passe, that
first in Spaine, after in Ireland, and then in Scotland, the kings which ruled ouer the Scotishmen, receiued the crowne sitting vpon that stone, vntill the time of Robert the first king of
Scotland. The inscription also of the stone, though ingrauen long time after, as should
appeare, was this:
<quote rend="block"><lg lang="la">
<l>Ni fallat fatum, Scoti quoc&uacute;nq; locatum</l>
<l>Inuenient lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem.</l>
		</lg>
<emph>Which may be thus translated:</emph>
<lg>
<l>Except old sawes doo faile,</l>
<l>and wisards wits be blind,</l>
<l>The Scots in place must reigne,</l>
<l>where they this stone shall find.</l>
</lg></quote>
</p>
<p>But to returne where I left touching Gathelus. When he perceiued that his people 
<note place="marg">Galitia not sufficient to find the Scots.</note>
multiplied in such wise, as the countrie which was appointed him by the last agr&eacute;ement, was not
able to susteine them, he was loth to breake the peace which he had established with the
Spaniards, by s&eacute;eking to inlarge the bounds of his dominion with breach of couenant: and
<note place="marg">The Scots s&eacute;eke new seats.</note>
therefore vnderstanding that there was an Iland lieng north ouer against Spaine, wherein
were but few inhabitors, he caused all such ships as he was able to make, to be brought
togither into an hauen n&eacute;ere vnto Brigantia, and commanding a great armie of his owne
people and subiects to be assembled, he appointed his two sonnes whome h&eacute;e had by his
wife Scota, the one named Hiberus, and the other Himecus, to conueie them ouer into that
Iland, which afterwards they named Hibernia, after Hiberus, but now it is commonlie called
Ireland.</p>
<p>At their first arriuall there, they came into the hauen of Dundalke, where getting on land,
<note place="marg">The Scots ariue in Ireland.</note>
they first incamped themselues n&eacute;ere the shore, and then sent foorth certeine of their folks
to search if they could learne what people inhabited in the countrie, by whome at their returne, and by such as they had happened vpon and brought with them, they vnderstood how
there was no great number of inhabitants in that Ile, and that they which dwelled there were
verie simple, such I meane as liued onelie by milke and herbs, with other the like things as
<note place="marg">Irishmen liue by milke and hearbes.</note>

<note place="marg">Irishmen are gentlie intreated.</note>
the earth by nature brought foorth of hir owne accord, without mans helpe or vse of anie
tillage. Herevpon Hiber with his brother Himecus, went not about with force, but by gentlenesse to win those people, minding to ioine them in friendship so with their Scotishmen,
that both the people might be made as one. Neither was this hard to be doone, sithens the
inhabitants (perceiuing the Scotishmen not to go about to harme them) came flocking in
wholie about them, submitting themselues into their hands with gladnesse.</p>

<note place="marg">Hiber returned into Spaine.</note>

the companie, sailed backe into Spaine, where finding his father Gathelus dead, he succ&eacute;eded
<note place="marg">Hiber succ&eacute;eded his father Gathelus.</note>
in his place of gouernement, to the great reioising of all the people there.</p>
<p>This Hiber was a man of great courage, and more giuen to the wars than his father before
him, so that where his father contenting himselfe with the bounds and limits of the countrie assigned him by composition, sought no further (as is said) to inlarge the same: Hiber ceassed
<note place="marg">Hiber a conquerour.</note>
not to conquer cities and townes n&eacute;ere adioining to the borders of his subiects, by reason

an ambassage vnto Metellus, who as then reigned amongst the Scotish men in Spaine, requiring him of aid and succor against their enimies, who went about with tooth and naile to
expell all the Scotish nation out of Ireland, which they were like inough to bring to passe, if in
time there were not speedie remedie through his aid prouided for the contrarie.</p>
<p>Metellus hearing these newes, as a man mooued with a naturall zeale toward all the Scotish

all wrong and iniuries: immediatlie therefore he sent his thr&eacute;e sons, Hermoneus, Ptolemeus,
and Hibertus, with a chosen power of wariors ouer into Ireland, where vanquishing the enimies
with fierce and cruell battels, they set the Scotishmen in sure and quiet possession of all their
lands and liuings. This doone Ptolomeus and Hibertus remained there to rule and inhabit
the countrie. But Hermoneus, who was the eldest brother, returned backe againe to Spaine,

<p>After this the Scotish estate continued many yeares in good quiet in Ireland, the people still
increasing in wealth and puissance, till prosperitie the mother of contention, stirred vp grudge
and parcialities amongst them, which shortlie would haue decaied the force of the Scotish nation, if the ancient lords had not prouided redresse in time, which was to persuade the people
to haue a king of their owne, who being partaker with none of them in their factions, might
haue the absolute gouernance of the whole, so that by common consent they sent into Spaine

(as some suppose) for that they vsed gaie apparell of diuers and sundrie colours; but the

ouer into Gathnesse, whereof it came to passe, that the streict there at this present is called
Pictland firth: and so in continuance of time increasing in number, they passed further
into the land, and got possession of Rosse, Murrey land, Merne, and Anguse, and after that,
entring into Fiffe and Louthian, they droue such Britains from thence as inhabited there before, which were but a simple kind of people, as those that applied nothing but onelie nourishing and br&eacute;eding of cattell.</p>
<p>These Picts, as by conference of times may app&eacute;ere, entred first into Scotland, about the
yeare after the creation of the world 3633, and being once arriued, they began to erect and

<note place="marg">The Picts make strong holds.</note>
build certeine forts, wherein they might defend themselues, if any force of enimies should
chance to put them to such shifts; but perceiuing they could not continue any time without
wiues to mainteine their stocke and progenie by bringing foorth issue, they thought it expedient to require of the Scotishmen some number of women to marrie with, that thereby a sure
<note place="marg">The Picts require wom&emacr; of the Scots.</note>
aliance might be had betwixt both nations, &amp; that if n&eacute;ed required, they might the better
defend them from teir common enimies the Britains, whom they knew would be loth to s&eacute;e
the increase of either Scots or Picis, as those that were strangers to them, and vsurpers vpon
their confines.</p>
<p>This request was granted, and a full league ratified betwixt the Scotishmen and Picts,
<note place="marg">A league made.</note>
with couenants, that neither of them should seeke to vsurpe any p&eacute;ece of that which the
other held, but content themselues with their owne marches. And further, he that attempted
to wrong the one, should be accounted an enimie to both: and against whom they should be
readie to ioine their powers in either others defense. Also it was accorded, that if at anie time
<note place="marg">The succession of the gouernement.</note>
it were doubtfull who ought to succ&eacute;ed in the gouernement of the Pictish kingdome, some
one descended of those Scotish women should be admitted to the throne.</p>
<p>This aliance was euen at the first misliked of the Britains, who doubted, that if these two
<note place="marg">Their aliance misliked.</note>
nations should once be ioined inseparablie togither, they might in time to come increase to
greater puissance than should stand well with the suertie of their estate. Therefore studieng
how to preuent that danger, they thought the readiest meane to destroie both those nations was
<note place="marg">Dissention a present destroier.</note>
(if they might bring it to passe) to set them first togither by the eares amongst themselues, that
afterwards when their powers were by such meanes sore abated, they might the more easilie subdue them at their pleasures. This deuise the Britains kept secret for a time, till occasion serued
to worke their intent. In which meane while the affinitie betwixt the Scots and Picts increased
to the wealth of both nations, and for the issue sake great loue and friendship was mainteined
among them. The Picts applied themselues to tilling the ground, and building of fortresses:
<note place="marg">The Picts good husbandmen.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots giuen to hunting and fouling.</note>
the Scots set all their delight in hunting and fouling, vsing about the same to go armed in iacks
and light iesternes with bow and arrowes, no otherwise than if it had beene in open warre:
for in this exercise they placed all the hope of the defense of their possessions, lands and
liberties.</p>
<p>At length, the Britains perceiuing happilie some grudge or enuie to be entred amongst them,
<note place="marg">The Britains send ambassadors vnto the Picts.</note>

<note place="marg">A craftie suggestion.</note>
they sent solemne ambassadors vnto the Picts, declaring that it were more honorable for them
to ioine in league with the Britains, than with the Scots: which Britains were knowne to be
famous, both in peace and war, and inhabited a countrie most fruitfull and replenished with all
commodities necessarie, hauing therein rich mines of diuers kinds of mettall, where the Scots being a rude nation, wild and sauage, inhabited a barren countrie, full of rough and fruitlesse
mounteins, delighting thereto in nothing but in the slaughter of men and beasts. And herevnto
they added that (which most mooued the Picts) how it was foretold them by prophesies, that
<note place="marg">Prophesies.</note>
the Scots through treason should vtterlie in time to come extinguish and destroie all the
Pictish bloud. Which persuasions induced the Picts at the last, to make a league with the
Britains, who promised their aid at all times, in whatsoeuer enterprise the Picts should take in
hand against the Scots, and as often as occasion should require.</p>
<p>This league thus being confirmed with the Britains, incouraged the Picts so, that they
<note place="marg">The Picts become enimies to the Scots.</note>
sought dailie how to picke quarels, and fall out with the Scotishmen: wherevpon making
proclamation that no Scotishmen should enter into their borders, vpon paine of death: some

summes: wherevpon the Scots being kindled with iust displeasure, on the other side requited
them with the like, euer as they caught any of the said Picts by hap or otherwise amongst
them, or in their walks.</p>
<p>The one nation s&eacute;eking thus to be reuenged of the other, there insued open war betwixt
them: whervpon the Sotishmen, to the end they might be the better able to mainteine their
<note place="marg">Scots send for aid into Ireland.</note>
quarell, sent ouer their ambassadors vnto their kinsmen in Ireland, requiring them of aid in
that present danger, as hauing now not onelie warres with the Picts, but also with the Britains, who minded nothing but the vtter destruction of them and their linage, except speedie
remedie were found. And for that they saw it n&eacute;edful to haue one onelie head and gouernor,
<note place="marg">They require a gouernor.</note>
they made sute also to haue some capteine of honor with them into Albion, vnto whom as to
their king they would submit themselues. In that season amongst the Irish Scotishmen,
<note place="marg">Ferguhardus king in Ireland.</note>
there reigned a king named Ferguhardus, who inclining to the petition of the British Scots,
caused an huge armie forthwith to be leuied, and thereto he appointed his owne sonne

Fergusius to be generall of the same, a worthie yoong gentleman, and an expert warrior: whome
hee sent ouer with his puissant companie, in such speed as was possible. He had also with
him the marble stone, that he might conceiue the better hope to reigne there as a king, bicause he went foorth vnto such a dangerous warre.</p>
<p>Such also as went with him in this iournie, had their wiues, their children, and all their substance with them, as the maner of the nation then was, when they went forth into any forren
countrie. Now it came to passe that this Fergusius was no sooner come into Albion among

<note place="marg">A king is for to be obeied.</note>
of such inconueniences, as might rise through manie gouernors, they decr&eacute;ed to choose onlie
one, whome in all things, as their king &amp; head, they would from thencefoorth follow and
obeie.</p>
	  </div>

<div n="Fergusius" type="section">
<head>FERGUSIUS.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">BUT</hi> bicause there was none thought so m&eacute;et to beare that office, as Fergusius, and that
the chaire of hope was also brought with him: they concluded by whole consent to commit
that charge vnto him, and so to the great reioising of the people, he was placed vpon his
marble stone, and crowned king, being the first of the Scotish nation that euer ruled in Albion
as absolute gouernor, who began his reigne in the yeare after the creation of the world 3649,
which is (as Harison saith in his chronologie) before the incarnation of our sauiour 327, after
the building of Rome 420, and after the entring of Brutus into Britaine 790.</p>
<p>The kingdome of the Scotishmen being thus begun in Albion, Ferguse tooke vpon him
to rule as king, making prouision on all sides to resist his enimies: who whilest these things
were a dooing in Argile, had assembled their powers: vnto whom also the Britains had ioined
<note place="marg">The Britains aid against the Scots.</note>
themselues, and were now entred into the Scotish borders. Ferguse hauing hereof knowledge, sp&eacute;edilie got togither his people, and came with banners displaied to encounter his enimies. In king Ferguses banner, there was a red lion portraied rampant, with his taile folden
towards his backe, as though he did beat the same, which is the maner of them when they be
mooued to displeasure. Ferguse was the first that bare this cognisance in Albion, which euersince hath b&eacute;ene borne by those kings that haue successiuelie reigned after him there.</p>
<p>Both the armies were now come within sight of other, and readie to haue giuen the onset, when there went a murmuring amongst the Picts, that their companions the Britains were
<note place="marg">The Britains are about to deceiue the Picts.</note>
gotten to a hill a little beside them, minding to s&eacute;e the end of the battell before they did stir,
and then if occasion serued (as their hope was it should) they purposed to fall vpon both parties, as well Picts as Scots, and so to destroie them both, the vanquishers togither with the
vanquished, as they found them out of araie in following the chase. The like report was

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"brought"</fw>-->

<pb n="40"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"40"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

brought vnto Ferguse by one that fled to his side from the enimies campe, touching this 
<note place="marg">Treason reuealed vnto Ferguse.</note>
treason of the Britains, conspiring the exterminion of both the people.</p>
<p>By reason whereof, either part being put in feare of that which might insue through the
<note place="marg">Ferguse sendeth to the Picts.</note>
malicious purpose of the Britains, they kept their tents certeine daies togither, without making
any hast to battell. And in the meane while Ferguse sent a messenger vnto the king of the
Picts, requiring him to come to a communication before they should fight, for that he had to
informe him of such matters as perteined no lesse to the safegard and preseruation of the
Picts, than of his owne people the Scots. The king of the Picts willinglie gaue eare to this
message, and so a little beside both the armies standing in battell araie, the two kings accompanied with a few of their nobles met togither, where in the end the danger in which
they both stood, being plainelie disclosed and throughlie weied, they condescended to haue a
<note place="marg">A peace to be concluded.</note>
further treatie of peace, which the king of the Picts alleged he might not conclude without
the publike consent of his subiects; and therefore he appointed on the daie following to returne to the same place againe, there to giue a resolute answer, after he had vnderstood the
minds of his lords and commons in the same.</p>
<p>Herevpon therefore returning to his campe, he called his councell afore him, declaring the
<note place="marg">The king of the Picts called his councell and commons.</note>
substance of the communication which had beene betwixt king Ferguse and him, which was in
effect tending to this end. First considering the present deuises of the Britains, there was nothing more expedient than a peace to be agr&eacute;ed vpon, as well for the commoditie of the Picts
as Scots, if they would yeeld withall to auoid the imminent perill of their vtter ruine and common destruction intended by the Britains.</p>
<p>Herevpon also he required their aduise what they thought good to be doone; declaring
that according as they counselled him, he would worke therein. This matter being thus proposed, as there were diuerse heads, so were there sundrie opinions. Some iudged that in no
case they could enter frendship againe with the Scots, who had so cruellie slaine and murthered a great number of the Pictish nation; and had shewed such tokens of a beastlie furious nature, that there was no hope to continue long in amitie with such a raging kind of
people: and hereto they held that it was not vnknowne how the prophesie went, that the
<note place="marg">A prophesie.</note>
Scots should in the end destroie all the Pictish progenie. So that it were wisdome to k&eacute;epe
their power vnder, so long as was possible, and not to increase the same by ioining with
them in friendship.</p>
<p>Other were of a contrarie mind, esteeming that in no wise the Scotish mens friendship ought
to be refused, vnlesse they would determine to s&eacute;eke new dwellings in some other forraine parties; sith the Britains would not faile, but vpon occasion take what vantage they could to expell them both, as well Scots as Picts, out of the countries now by them possessed. And as
for that, which was alledged touching the prophesie, if the gods had so determined, then
might no policie of man preuent it: and if there were no such thing appointed by the same
gods, what follie then were it to cast such dreadfull doubts where no cause was? Ouer and
besides this, they had taken them wiues of the Scotish nation, and thereby ingraffed their s&eacute;ed
(the hope of their posteritie) in that stocke, which is the n&eacute;erest meane and foreablest occasion
to nourish friendship amongest people, that is or may be deuised; therefore it should not be
onelie profitable but necessarie also to haue peace with the Scots, to renew againe with them the
former league, to the perpetuall strengthening and aduancement of both the nations.</p>
<p>Whilest the Picts were thus in debating the matter, their wiues also being present there in
<note place="marg">The Picts admonished by their wiues to peace.</note>
the armie, came in amongest them with their children, and in most lamentable wise besought
their husbands to hauepitie vpon them, in their so sorowfull case, and not to suffer their hands to be
defiled with vnnaturall murther, sith it were lesse discomfort to them with their sillie little ones
to die anie kind of death whatsoeuer it were, rather than to behold their husbands with their
fathers, their brethren, and their kinsfolke ioine togither in battell, and there to kill one another
without all mercie and compassion. The nobles and gentlemen of the Picts hearing the cries
<note place="marg">The Picts are moued to pittie.</note>
of these women, and being now som what moued to pitie, consented at last to haue peace with
the Scotish men, and to renew againe the old league that was heretofore betweene them: and

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"for"</fw>-->

<pb n="41"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"41"</fw>-->

for mutuall iniuries heretofore committed, that there should be a mutuall recompense, according as might stand with equitie and reason. So that where the Britains had been the
chiefe procurers of all that mischiefe and discord betwixt them, in hope thereby to destroy
both the parties, they should now be reputed from henceforth as common enimies to them
<note place="marg">Britainsreputed as enimies.</note>
both. As for all other articles &amp; conditions of agreement, it was ordeined that their king
should doo therein as vnto him might seeme good.</p>
<p>In the morning therefore, as was appointed, the king of Picts meeting with king Ferguse,
<note place="marg">The m&eacute;eting of the two kings.</note>
declared what his subiects were agr&eacute;ed vpon: and further opening his mind touching the establishment of the peace, thought it conuenient to haue a day of m&eacute;eting betwixt them to ratifie
the same. Wherewith Ferguse being well contented &amp; glad that through his motion a peace
should thus ensue, a day was appointed betwixt them and kept accordinglie, so that comming
<note place="marg">An other day taken for the ratification of the peace.</note>

<note place="marg">The Britains go homward disappointed of their purpose.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots and Picts returne home in peace.</note>
togither, the ancient league was in all points renewed, with some conditions added thereto,
auailable (as was thought) for the stronger confirmation thereof. Before this, and after the first
m&eacute;eting betwixt the Scots and Picts, I meane so soone as the Britains had vnderstanding of this
agr&eacute;ement, they had no lust to tarie longer in the field, but raising their power, they departed
their waies homewards, doubting least the said agr&eacute;ement might turne finallie to their gaine.
The Picts and Scotishmen also after they had thus fullie ratified the peace and league betwixt
them, brake vp their camps, euerie man repairing to the place of his abode.</p>
<p>The king also of the Britains named Coill (soiourning in that season n&eacute;ere about Yorke)
<note place="marg">This Coilus by the circumstance of the time, and other considerations, should s&eacute;eme to be the same whome the Britains name Gutteline.</note>

<note place="marg">Coilus his subtiltie.</note>
being informed of this sudden renouation of the league betwixt the Scotishmen and Picts,
was nothing ioyfull of the newes: for he doubted least in time to come their confederacie
might be occasion of their further increasing in puissance, and after that some new occasion
of his trouble. Wherefore studieng by what waies and meanes he might best prouide remedie for such inconueniences as might insue, he attempted nothing openlie for the space of
two yeares, but onelie watched his time, to the end that if he might in that season chance
(thorough the insolent courage of either nation) to espie anie occasion seruiceable for his
time, he might set vpon and be a plague vnto them both.</p>
<p>At length also he caused his subiects (such I meane as bordered n&eacute;ere to the marches of both
<note place="marg">The Britains rob the Scots and the Picts for to stirre discord.</note>
the people) to fetch preies and booties out of the Pictish confins. So that when the Picts sent
thither with request to haue restitution made, it was by and by answered, that the Scots had
doone such trespasses (being a people iniured vnto such feats by nature, and not the Britains,
who were nothing guiltie in that kind of matter; and thus would the Britains doo in like sort
when they had robbed the Scots, so that with such iniurious dissimulation, aswell Scots as Picts
<note place="marg">The Scots and Picts inuade the Britains.</note>
being not a little offended, they entred soone after into the British confins, robbing &amp; spoiling
the same, as their custome is, with all maner of crueltie. When Coill of Britaine had notice
of these dooings, he tooke grieuous indignation thereat, and therevpon determined to prooue
whether he might with open warres atchiue his purpose, which he could not bring to passe
by his former cloaked practise. And herewith assembling an armie, he entred into the Scotish
<note place="marg">Coilus entred into Scotland with an armie.</note>
borders lieng towards the Irish seas, wasting &amp; spoiling with fire and sword whatsoeuer he
found in his waies, till he came euen to the riuer of Dune, where incamping himselfe vpon
the banks thereof, he sent forth companies of his souldiers to destroie the countrie, and to
bring in all such prisoners as they should lay hands vpon.</p>
<p>But in the meane time, and so soone as Ferguse heard of the approch of the Britains, he
<note place="marg">Ferguse assembled a great power of Scotismen.</note>
caused all the people in the countrie to get them with their goods &amp; cattels vnto the mounteins,
except such as were able to beare armour: whome he appointed to attend vpon him, to defend the countrie as occasion serued. Whereof Coill hauing knowledge brought by an
espiall, he sent foorth about fiue thousand nimble men, and such as had beene vsed to clime
craggie hilles, to go before and win the passages, purposing the next day to follow himselfe
with the whole armie. But the Scotishmen and Picts being now assembled togither, and certified hereof also by their spies, they first fell in consultation what they were best to doo; and
in the end agr&eacute;ed that the same night they should set vpon the British campe: Ferguse with
his Scotishmen on the one side, and the king of the Picts on the other; so that in the dead

of the night the Scotishmen killing the watch, were entered into the British campe, yer Coill
had knowledge of anie such thing.</p>
<p>Whereby it came to passe that whilest the Britains (awaked with the noise) drew vnto
that part where the alarme rose, to beat backe the Scots; the Picts comming ouer the riuer
of Dune, by a certeine blind foord, assailed them on the backs, to the great confusion of
the whole armie, by reason whereof the Britains (s&eacute;eing none other remedie but to saue
themselues by flight) turned their backs and fled, in which turmoile they were trodden
downe and fell by heaps one vpon an other, and were not able to helpe themselues, nor yet
to make shift to auoid the hands of their aduersaries. In this businesse also Coill himselfe
<note place="marg">Coill was slaine and his whole armie discomfited, of whome as <emph>Hector Boet.</emph> saith, their countrie of Coill tooke name.</note>
chanced to be oppressed amongest the rest, so that he was found dead in the search of such
as were slaine, and after solemnlie buried according to his estate in Troinouant, leaning the
kingdome vnto his sonne Sisellius, who with his mother Mertia gouerned the same togither
by the space of manie yeares.</p>
<p>Such Britains also as escaped out of their enimies hands, got them togither in the next
morning, &amp; perceiuing what losse they had susteined not onlie by the death of their prince,
but also in the slaughter of a great part of their whole armie, sent an herault vnto the Scots
and Picts to require a peace: which though the most part of the people were not in will to
<note place="marg">Peace concluded.</note>
haue consented vnto, yet persuaded in the end by their princes, they were contented to y&eacute;eld
thereto: so that a generall peace was concluded, and sp&eacute;edilie published betwixt them.</p>
<p>Immediatlie herevpon, the Picts with their part of the spoile gotten at this iournie, departed to their homes, and Ferguse returned into Argile; where studieng dailie for the quiet
aduancement of the Scotish commonwealth, he called &amacr; parlement of his nobles, and first
<note place="marg">A parlement.</note>

<note place="marg">An exhortation vnto quietnesse and peace.</note>
declaring to the assemblie how much bound they were to the gods for giuing them this
victorie ouer so puissant enimies as the Britains were, he exhorted them to liue in friendlie
concord amongest themselues, and to absteine from violating the leagues now concluded,
aswell with the Britains as before hand with the Picts.</p>
<p>Also for the auoiding of enuious contention, and for the better assurance of euerie mans
estate, he iudged it necessarie to haue a partition made of all the lands belonging vnto the
<note place="marg">The land is parted.</note>
Scotish dominion. For before they occupied the whole as in commune, without knowing
to whome this p&eacute;ece or that did belong. Which politike aduise of Ferguse, the Scotishmen
praised most highlie, promising not onelie to follow his counsell herein in all that he should
<note place="marg">Obedient subiects.</note>
wish, but also in all that he should otherwise command.</p>
<p>Wherevpon shortlie after there were chosen by his aduise seuen ancient personages, men
of good conscience and great experience, which were appointed to be surueiors of the whole
countrie, and to diuide the same as n&eacute;ere as they could into a set number of equall portions
<note place="marg">Men diuide the land into Portions.</note>
(but with this consideration, that according as the fruitfulnesse or barrennesse of the soile
required, so they should inlarge or diminish the circuit of their bounds.) When they had
viewed the countrie, and according to their commission seuered foorth the same into parts,
they returned into Argile, where Ferguse then soiourned, and there in his presence, the
<note place="marg">The gouernement is giuen vnto the nobles by lots.</note>
names of all his noble men that were reputed as gouernors were put in lots, euerie of them
to haue such part of the realme for his owne, as should fall to him by good lucke and present hap.</p>
<p>By this meanes each of them being placed as his chance fell, they inhabited their quarters
with such people as they had the leading of, so that afterwards the countries tooke their
names of those the first gouernors: which names for the more part (being a little changed)
remaine amongst them euen vnto this day. Ferguse hauing thus without occasion of enuie
<note place="marg">Statutes and lawes are made.</note>
diuided his countrie amongst his nobles and subiects, studied furthermore to deuise lawes for
the maintenance of common quiet amongst them. And therefore amongst other ordinances
he made statutes against murther, robberie, burning of houses, and especiallie against theft.</p>
<p>He builded also the castell of Beregonium in Loughquhabre on the west side of Albion,

by all meanes to knit and couple the hearts of his subiects in one friendlie bond of inward
loue and amitie. Finallie, sailing afterward into Ireland to be arbitrator in a matter of
variance betwixt the nobles of that land, as he returned homewards by force of tempest, the
ship wherein he was inbarked, was driuen vpon a rocke, where he perished, after he had
reigned as king amongst the Scotishmen in Albion about 25 yeeres. The rocke where he
was thus cast away, hath b&eacute;ene euer since called rocke Ferguse, after his name.</p>
<p>In the same season there reigned amongst the Britains one Enanius, named by Hector

citie vpon the banke of the riuer called Caron, as the Scotish writers affirme, appointing it to be
the chiefe citie of all the Pictish kingdome, where in times past there was a faire commodious
hauen apt to harbour ships in at all seasons, but now it is dammed vp in such sort, that vneath
there appeareth anie token where that hauen was: and the citie it selfe was finallie subuerted
by Kenneth king of Scotland, as after shall appeare. The forenamed Cruthneus builded also
the towne of Agneda, afterwards called Edenbrough, of Ethus king of the Picts, the castell
was named the castell of Maidens, for that the daughters of the Pictish kings were there
kept vnder strait custodie, appointed to learne to sow &amp; woorke, till they came to y&eacute;eres of
mariage.</p>
<p>But now to returne to the Scotishmen. After the death of Ferguse, the nobles of the
realme assembled togither, to take counsell whome they might choose to succ&eacute;ed in his
place. Manie of them, in respect of the high benefits which their nation had receiued by
the politike gouernement of king Ferguse, would not in anie wise that his sonnes, though
yoong of y&eacute;eres, should be forgotten; but that according to reason and equitie, the eldest
of them should be elected, sith they might not otherwise deliuer them selues of the note of
ingratitude towards his father, vnto whome they were more bound than with toong can be
well expressed.</p>
<p>Other hauing a speciall regard to the quiet of their commonwealth, doubted least if they
crowned a child to their king, during his minoritie, it could not be but that there should
follow strife, enuie, and contention for the gouernance of his person and realme amongst the
nobles; and that in such wise, as the people being diuided into sundrie factions, the due
administration of iustice should be neglected, the nobles bearing and bolstering vp all kinds
of iniuries doone or committed by anie of their partakers.</p>
<p>And though it might so happen that they agr&eacute;ed vpon one speciall gouernor, as reason
was they should; yet should he s&eacute;eke to aduance his kinsfolks more than reason happilie
required, and peraduenture doo things otherwaies much displeasant to no small number of
them by that his priuate authoritie. And againe, the king should no sooner come to y&eacute;eres
of anie discretion, but one or other would put him in mind to take vpon him to rule the
whole him selfe, before he vnderstood what charge he had in hand: and by reason of his
fraile youth he lightlie would not follow the counsell of anie, but such as consented vnto
him in his sensuall lusts and inordinate fansies, which commonlie reigne in such princes as
take vpon them gouernance of realmes, before they know (through want of sufficient y&eacute;eres)
how to gouerne themselues.</p>
<p>For these and the like considerations, alledged by some of no small authoritie amongst
<note place="marg">Feritharis chosen king.</note>
them, it was agr&eacute;ed in the end, that one Feritharis the brother of the late deceassed Ferguse
should be crowned king, and haue the gouernance of the realme during his life: and herewith in the meane time to see his nephues king Ferguse his sons brought vp in princelie
nurture and discipline, as apperteined to the sons of a king: that after his deceasse, if he
liued till anie of them were come to ripe y&eacute;eres, they might succ&eacute;ed him in the estate and
kingdome.</p>
<p>This ordinance also they decr&eacute;ed to be obserued as a law from thencefoorth euer after,
that if the king died leauing no issue, but such as were vnder age to succ&eacute;ed him, then

should one of his n&eacute;erest coosins, such as was thought m&eacute;etest to occupie the roome, be
chosen to reigne as king during his life, and after his deceasse the crowne to reuert vnto
his predecessors issue without controuersie, if the same were once growne vp to lawfull
age.</p>
<p>By this meanes then were children excluded from obteining the crowne, least the publike
libertie of the reaime might chance to be put in danger. But yet was it afterwards perceiued
<note place="marg">The choosing of kings was not allowed.</note>

princes, to the no small danger of ouerthrowing the whole state of the commonwealth, so
that tinallie that ordinance was clearelie abrogated, as you shall heare hereafter.</p>

<head>FERITHARIS.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">BUT</hi> now to my purpose. After Feritharis with the full consent of all the people was
thus elected king, he was inthronized with all solemnitie in receiuing his kinglie ornaments,
as his two edged sword, his scepter roiall, and his crowne of gold fashioned in forme of a
<note place="marg">A two edged sword.</note>
rampire made for defense of a towne or fortresse, signifieng that he tooke vpon him to preserue the libertie of his countrie, to s&eacute;e offendors dulie punished, and the execution of lawes
with equall punishment trulie ministred.</p>
<p>These ornaments of inuesture remained vnto the Scotish kings, without being in anie
point changed, till the daies of Achaius king of Scotland, who establishing a perpetuall league
with Charles the great, emperour and king of France, to indure for euer betw&eacute;ene the Scots
and Frenchmen, added vnto the crowne foure flower de lices, togither with foure croslets,
<note place="marg">The crowne changed,</note>
diuided in sunder with equall spaces, rising somewhat higher than the flower de lices: that
thereby the obseruing of the christian religion and sincere faith, mainteined by the Scotish
nation, might be the more euident to all men that beheld it. But now as touching Feritharis,
<note place="marg">The league with the Picts confirmed.</note>
shordie after he was thus inuested king, he came to an interuiew with the king of the Picts,
where manie things being communed of touching the wealth of both nations, the league
was in solemne wise confirmed, and such punished as had doone anie thing sounding to the
breach of the same.</p>
<p>After this, being returned home, he ordered himselfe in the administration of his charge
verie vprightlie, without giuing iust occasion vnto anie to find himselfe gr&eacute;eued: and thus
continued he certeine y&eacute;eres in such loue of all the estates of the realme, that afterwards
when his nephue Ferlegus the eldest sonne of king Ferguse, being now come to full age,
through instigation of some insolent persons, and such as by alteration hoped for aduancement, required (contrarie to the ordinance before established) to haue of him the crowne:
the matter was taken in such ill part, that where before the same Ferlegus was highlie beloued and honored of all the people, they were now readie (if Feritharis had not with
authoritie and gentle persuasions staied them) to haue torne him all in peeces: but although their rage was somewhat appeased by Feritharis, as is said, yet would they not be
pacified throughlie, till that all such as had b&eacute;ene of counsell with him in that practise, had
suffered death, and new gouernors appointed to haue the ouersight of him.</p>
<p>Feritharis liued not passing thr&eacute;e moneths after this businesse, but died suddenlie in the

added vnto the old: and also caused certeine places in sundrie parts of his dominion to b&eacute;e

had thus instructed his people in lawes and ordinances, aswell touching the religious seruice

<!--<fw place="top-left">"46"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

<p>Thus the Scotishmen in this season, setting all their delite on hunting, began also to vse
<note place="marg">Lawes made for hunting.</note>
lawes and statutes in proces of time concerning the same. And first it was ordeined, that
he whose dog did teise and go through to the end of the course with the deare, so that he
were s&eacute;ene to be at the fall, should haue the skin; the head &amp; hornes to remaine to him
whose dog did best next. The body being drest &amp; broken vp, should be distributed at the
pleasure &amp; discretion of the maister of the game. The bowels and panch were cast to the
<note place="marg">The dogs rewarded.</note>
dogs as the case required. And if there rose anie doubt in anie of these points, they should
choose by common consent, a iudge to determine of the matter. But whether these deuises were lawes made by the king as then for the further aduancement of his pleasure, or
rather customes growne and ratified by long continuall vse, I cannot tell, but certeine it is,
they were obserued through all the Scotish regions, as hauing the force of lawes, and so are
vsed euen vnto these daies.</p>
<p>Beside these ordinances for hunting, Doruadille commanded also, that all such statutes as
<note place="marg">Old lawes allowed, and new established.</note>
Ferguse had made, should be kept and obserued: wherevnto he added certeine new, namelie
diuerse sorts of punishments for sundrie kinds of transgressions, according to the qualities
of the same: which he caused to be ingrossed in books of record, and committed to the
custodie of a graue councellor, who by a common consent should haue the interpretation of
those lawes if anie doubt arose, and that when anie offendor should come before the iudge,
and heare the sentence read by him, the same offendor might vnderstand that he receiued
nothing but right at the iudges hands: by reason whereof it came to passe, that such offendors without repining willinglie were contented to suffer anie punishment whatsoeuer it
was that the law did so appoint them. This custome grew into such force, that it neuer
might yet be abrogated amongst them of the westerne Iles, but that euen vnto this day they
haue their lawiers amongst them, without whose denuntiation or decr&eacute;e taken out of the
register, no iudgement is reputed lawfull.</p>
<p>These were the acts and dooings of king Doruadille, who in the 28 y&eacute;ere of his reigne
departed this world at Beregonium, now called Dunstafage, leauing behind him a sonne
called Reuther as yet not of sufficient age to succ&eacute;ed in the estate. By reason whereof
Nothatus the brother of Doruadille, a man of comelie personage and wit, apt (as was thought)

to haue a realme in gouernance, was crowned king by force of law aboue remembred, debarring children vnder age to inherit the succession of the crowne.</p>

was made, and there sleaing diuers of the chiefe, he did put Ferquhard also in great hazard
of his life, who by flieng yet escaped his hands, and got him ouer into the Ile of Ila, whither
<note place="marg">Ferquhard fled into Ila.</note>
resorted vnto him diuers of the nobles (that fauored not Douale) with a great number of

<p>In the end, Ferquhard persuaded his companions to set all feare apart, and to returne with
<note place="marg">Ferquhard returneth into Scotland for to reuenge his iniurie.</note>
him into Scotland to take reuenge of Douale and his complices, being traitors and enimies
to the realme and common-wealth, so that first ioining hands, which they did wet in mans
bloud (according to the custome then vsed) they promised one to another to liue and die
in the quarell, and after imbarking themselues in certeine vessels, they entred the sea, and
passed ouer into Scotland, where gathering togither no small number of such as willinglie
resorted vnto them to their aid, they encountred with Douale in battell, whose host twise in
one daie was put to flight n&eacute;ere to the citie Beregonium with the losse of eight thousand men.</p>
<p>The night parted the fraie, but in the next morning, Douale and his partakers through
great indignation conceiued, for that they were so beaten backe by Ferquhard (hauing in
all his host not past 10000 persons) fiercelie came foorth of their tents to giue battell afresh,
and finding their enimies readie to receiue them, there was fought so cruell a battell betwixt
them, that in the end either part being sore trauelled with slaughter and long fight, was glad
to giue place to the other, not passing an eight hundred of all those that were present that
daie in the field as then being left aliue. Vpon Douales part there was slaine Gethus king
of Picts, whose daughter king Reuther had married, with a great number of his people:
also Douale himselfe with diuers of the nobles of Scotland, beside gentlemen &amp; c&omacr;mons

<p>Reuther escaping with life from this bloudie encounter, in the night following departed
<note place="marg">Reuther the king fled.</note>

life, partlie in respect of his fathers merits, and partlie againe for that it was knowne how
his tender youth was such as had not deserued death by any fact, otherwise than in that he
had followed the counsell of malicious persons. By this cruell murther and huge slaughter
thus committed betwixt these two nations of Scotishmen and Picts, both their forces were
so greatlie inf&eacute;ebled, that they became an easie prey to their ancient and common enimies
the Britains, who in such oportunitie of occasion thought not to sit still till the same might
happilie be past and gone.</p>
<p>First therefore with a mightie armie the Britains inuaded the Picts: the nobles of which
nation perceiuing themselues not able to make resistance, fled with their wiues, their children,
and the most part of their goods, ouer into the Iles of Orkenie, and there assembling togither, they created them a new king to haue the gouernance ouer them, who was also
named Gethus, and brother to the other Gethus a little before mentioned. H&eacute;ere also they

they found there, wronging them by no iniurious dealing at all (if the Scotish historie be

named by diuers writers the ancient kingdome of the Picts.</p>

<p>In the meane while the Britains seizing vpon such countries as these Picts had forsaken,
that is to saie, the Mers, Louthian, and others, they left in diuers places where they thought
expedient, garisons of men of war, to k&eacute;epe the same in due subiection: and after entred
into the confines of the Scotish kingdome, burning &amp; wasting all afore them, wherewith such
Scots as yet remained aliue, being highlie mooued to indignation, came stoutlie into the field
<note place="marg">The Scots ouerthrowne.</note>
to defend their countrie, and incountring with their enimies n&eacute;ere to Kalender wood, they
lost two thousand of their companie: the residue also being sore chased, fled into sundrie
parties for safegard of their liues.</p>
<p>This discomfiture put the Scotish nation into such feare and terror, that they vtterlie despaired of all recouerie, where contrariwise the Britains were so aduanced (in hope vtterlie
to expell all aliens out of their Ile) that pursuing the victorie in most earnest wise, they
forced Reuther and all the nobilitie of the Scotish nation that was yet left aliue, to fl&eacute;e for
safegard of their liues into the castell of Beregonium, where they held themselues as in the
surest hold. The Britains being certified of the repaire of their enimies to Beregonium, enuironed the castell with a strong and vehement siege, vntill that the Scots within were 
<note place="marg">Scots besieged deuoure one another.</note>
constreined through want of vittels to eate each other, according as the lots fell by a common
agr&eacute;ement made amongst them.</p>
<p>But when it came to passe, that euen those that were reputed as heads and gouernors,
and in whom consisted the hope of their whole defense, did now and then come to the
shambles as well as other of lesse reputation, they thought it best to trie by issuing foorth,
if any of their haps might be so good as to escape the danger present, whereas by tarieng still
within the fortresse, they should but deuoure one another without any reuenge for losse of
their liues had vpon their fierce and cruell enimies. Wherevpon by common consent there
<note place="marg">The Scots come foorth and fight.</note>

fiercelie skirmishing with the Britains, defended himselfe a good space right manfullie,
though in the end both he and his whole band were borne downe and slaine with prease
and multitude of his enimies that assailed him on each side. In the meane season, whilest
he thus occupied the Britains in fight on one side, Reuther with the residue of his people
<note place="marg">Reuther escapeth.</note>
brake foorth by another waie, and escaping to the sea side, got ships and fled ouer into the
westerne Iles, where he found a great number of other Scotishmen that were gotten thither,
being compelled by Oenus king of the Britains to auoid foorth of the countries, which they
before inhabited.</p>
<p>Reuther remained not long in the Iles, but passed ouer into Ireland. The Britains not a

<note place="marg">They inhabit the mounteins.</note>
little mooued for his escape with the other of the Scotish lords, reuenged their displeasure
on such commons and other meane people as fell into their hands, so that such as might
escape, got them into the mounteins, and liued there by roots, berries, &amp; other wild fruits
in summer, and in winter by such veneson and flesh of wild beasts as they killed in the
wildernesse: and sometimes they came downe and made raises vpon the Britains that occupied their houses and lands, fetching great booties verie often from amongest them.</p>
<p>This cruell warre lasted twelue y&eacute;eres, vntill in maner all such Scots and Picts as remained
in Albion were brought vnder seruitude to the Britains. In which meane while, Gethus king
of the Picts kept his siege roiall in Pomonia the ch&eacute;efest Ile of the Orkenies. Reuther also
begot of his wife a sonne named Thereus, and shortlie after being procured by letters and

<head>IOSINA.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">THIS</hi> Iosina being proclaimed king, renewed the ancient leagues with the Picts and Britains.
He had physicians in great estimation; for that during his abode in Ireland, he was nourished
of a child amongest them, and by reason thereof had some knowledge in the facultie, speciallie he vnderstood the vertues and properties of herbes, wherewith in those daies the Scots
vsed to heale and remedie all maner of sores and diseases, which as then were few in number,
in respect of the sundrie kinds which are now knowen amongst vs; and all by reason of the
superfluous f&eacute;eding and excesse of meats and drinks vsed in our time, whereas our elders 
<note place="marg">Surfeting the cause of strange diseases, which so commonlie now reigne.</note>

<note place="marg">Two ancient philosophers through shipwrack arriue in Scotland, and are ioifullie receiued of the king.</note>
sufficed with a little, liued without surfeting, the chiefest br&eacute;eder of such strange and manifold
sicknesses. In this Iosina his daies it chanced that a Portingale ship was driuen and drowned
by force of a streinable tempest n&eacute;ere vnto the shore of one of the Scotish Iles, where diuerse
of those that were within the same ship, mariners and other escaped to land, amongest whome
were two ancient and fatherlie old men of right reuerend aspect and countenance.</p>
<p>These two in companie with some of the inhabitants of that Ile came ouer into Beregonium,
where the king as then soiourned. They were Spanish priests of the pagane religion, whose
purpose was to haue gone vnto Athens in Grecia (as some write) but whence soeuer they were,
and what purpose soeuer they had, certeine it is they were philosophers; and therefore the
king receiued them most ioifullie, dooing them all the honor he could deuise, and commanding that they should be lodged within his owne palace, where they had all things n&eacute;edfull,
and accordinglie ministred vnto them.</p>
<p>These philosophers, after they had refreshed themselues at their ease for the space of 14
daies, the king caused them to come before him, requiring them to shew their opinion what
they thought by the nature of the soile, the maners and customs of his people, so far forth as
they had s&eacute;ne and heard. They without pausing for answere declared, that as yet they had
not had time to learne those things, but onelie thus far by coniecture they supposed, that the
ground was more like to be fruitfull of mettall mines, than of corne and graine, as conteining
far more riches vnderneath the earth than aboue; and this they said that they gathered by
the influence of the heauens vnder the which it laie. And as for the rites and vsages of the
people, in one point they could in no wise commend them, for that in religion they followed
<note place="marg">The Scotish religion reproued.</note>
the superstitious rites of the Aegyptians, woorshipping the immortall gods in the shape of
beasts and fouls, whereas God was euen the same that did comprehend both heauen and
earth, with the waters and all things in them conteined, whome they named nature, and as it
were the primordiall cause or beginning of all things, vnto whome it was not possible to deuise anie similitude of liuing thing that might in anie wise represent him. Therefore (said
they) men ought to worship the liuing God with fire and deuout praier, building him a temple for that purpose, and onelie vnto him to burne incense, and to performe vowes: at whose
hands such as liued chastlie, vprightlie, and according to the rules of iustice, ought euer to
<note place="marg">Vpright liuing well rewarded at Gods hands.</note>
looke for some high benefit, where other that liued contrarilie might euer stand in doubt of
contrarie reward.</p>
<p>With these their sensible instructions they persuaded manie of the Scotish nation vnto then
opinion, though the greatest part would by no means follow anie other kind of religion,
than that which they had receiued from their elders: neither could anie of them be brought
to thinke otherwise of the sun, the moone, and stars, but that there was a certeine diuine
power or godhead in euerie one of them. And thus much of these strangers brieflie and by
the way, who came into Scotland at this present: but now to proc&eacute;ed with our purpose.
When Iosina had reigned 24 yeares, he departed out of this world at Beregonium, being a

which gouerned after the maner of bishops, in all matters perteining to religion, and were called
in the Scotish toong Durceglijs, in Latine Druides. These Druides were appointed to be resident within the Ile of Man, as the Scotishmen hold opinion: but other thinke rather that they
were resident in Angleseie, in the British toong called Mon. Vnto these also hauing great
liuings assigned them, were the inferiour priests subiect, as receiuing at their hands all iniunctions and orders for the vse of their sacrifices and other ceremonies.</p>
<p>These Druides afterwards applied themselues so earnestlie to the studie of philosophie,

<note place="marg">The authoritie of the Druides increased.</note>
whereof their authoritie dailie so far foorth increased, that finallie iudgements in most doubtfull matters were committed vnto their determinations, offendors by their discretion punished, and such
as had well deserued accordinglie by their appointments rewarded. Moreouer such as refused
to obeie their decrees and ordinances, were by them excommunicated, so that no creature
durst once k&eacute;epe companie with such, till they were reconciled againe, and cl&eacute;erelie by the
same Druides absolued.</p>
<p>Plinie, Cornelius Tacitus, Strabo, and Iulius C&aelig;sar, with diuers other approued authors,
make mention of these Druides, signifieng how the first beginning of their religion was in Britaine (which some comprehend all wholie vnder the name of Albion) and from thence was
the same religion brought ouer into France. Finnanus was not onelie praised for his setting
foorth of that heathen religion, but also for his politike gouernement of the estate in ioifull rest
and quietnesse. Neither was his fame a little aduanced for the mariage concluded and made
betwixt his sonne Durstus and Agasia daughter to the king of Britains, for by that aliance he
wan diuers of the British nation vnto his friendship. Finallie, this Finnanus died at Camelon,

<p>But now touching king Ewin, his chiefest studie was to mainteine iustice throughout his
<note place="marg">The dutie of a good prince.</note>
dominion, and to w&eacute;ed out such transgressours as went about to trouble the quiet estate of his
subiects. Furthermore, considering what inconueniencies proc&eacute;eded through the vse of 
<note place="marg">A notable ordinance.</note>
voluptuous pleasures &amp; wanton delites, he ordeined that the youth of his realme should be trained
to endure hardnesse, paine, and trauell, as to lie vpon hard boords without anie feather beds or
pillows vnder them. Also to exercise themselues to throw the dart, to shoot, to wrestle, and
to beare armour aswell in time of peace as of warre; that when need required, trauell and such
kind of exercises should be no paine but pleasure vnto them; where otherwaies lacke of vse
might make the same intollerable. Whilest Ewin is thus occupied about the setting foorth
of necessarie ordinances for the wealth of his realme, the king of the Picts did send vnto him
ambassadours to require his aid against the Britains, who were entred his countrie in robbing
and spoiling the same.</p>
<p>Ewin consenting quicklie to that request, leuied an armie forthwith, and with all sp&eacute;ed
passed forward to ioine with the Picts, in purpose to reuenge the old iniuries doone to his nation
by the Britains, who likewise were as readie to receiue battell, as the Scots and Picts were desirous to giue it, so that both the armies incountring togither (the Scots and Picts on the one
side, and the Britains on the other) there insued a sore conflict betwixt them, continued with
vnmercifull slaughter till night parted them in sunder; no man as then able to iudge who had
<note place="marg">A doubtfull battell.</note>
the better, but either part being priuie to their owne losses, withdrew themselues further off
from the place of the battell, so that the Scots and Picts the same night got them into the mounteins of Pictland, and the Britains so soone as it was day made homewards with all sp&eacute;ed towards their countrie, and leauing no small preie and bootie behind them, which the Scotishmen and the Picts recouered, comming downe with all sp&eacute;ed from the mounteins, when
they once heard that their enimies were departed.</p>
<p>King Ewin being returned from his iournie, determined to passe the residue of his life in
rest and quietnesse, appointing iudges in euerie part of his realme, for the ministring of iustice
and executing of lawes, according to the due forme and ordinance of the same. He appointed
also such as should watch for the apprehension of th&eacute;eues and robbers by the high waies, assigning them liuings of the common treasurie to liue by. And there be euen vnto this day
that hold still such liuings, though the office be worne out of vse and forgotten.</p>
<p>After this, he builded a castell not farre distant from Beregonium, which he named after his
<note place="marg">Dunstafage is builded.</note>
owne name Euonium: but afterwards it was called Dunstafage, which is as much to say, as
St&eacute;euens castell, which name it beareth at this present. Finallie, this Ewin, after he had
reigned to the great weale of the realme, about 19 y&eacute;eres, he departed this life, leauing behind him a son base begotten, named Gillus, who causing his fathers funerals to be executed
with all solemne pompe and ceremonies, raised vp soone after sundry obelisks about his graue
neere vnto Dunstafage, where he was buried.</p>
<p>There were present also at the buriall, two of Durstus his sonnes, whome Ewin in his life
time had reuoked home out of Ireland, where they were in exile. Both these, as well the
one as the other, bicause they were twins, and not knowne whether of them came first into
the world, looked to be king after Ewin: their names were Dothan and Dorgall. And such
malicious emulation and enuious spite rose betwixt the two brethren, for the atteining of their
purpose, that greater could not be deuised; which Gillus, like a craftie &amp; subtill fox, by 
<note place="marg">The craftie working of Gillus.</note>
couert means sought still to augment; and in the end causing them to come togither for some
conclusion of agr&eacute;ement, at length when he had set them further at ods than they were before, he procured a number of souldiers appointed for the purpose to raise a tumult (as though
it had bene in taking of contrarie parts) and there to slea them both.</p>
<p>Thus Gillus hauing brought to purpose that he came for, shewed in countenance as though
<note place="marg">Durstus two sonne are slaine.</note>

and herewith he commeth running foorth with a high voice, declaring to his companie, that
if he had not made good shift for himselfe, he had beene slaine by the hands of Dothan and
Dorgall, who fell into such misch&eacute;efe themselues, as they had prepared for other. Herevpon

also he required his friends and seruants most earnestlie to conueie him into some sure place,
where he might be out of danger, and in better securitie: in somuch that manie of those that
heard him, giuing credit to his words, went with him with all sp&eacute;ed vnto Dunstafage, where
being receiued into the castell with diuers of the nobles that followed him, he got him into a gallerie, and there making an inuectiue oration against the sonnes of Durstus, and touching by
the way what perill might insue to the commonwealth by ciuill diuision, he persuaded
them to commit the rule into his hands, vntill it might be certeinlie knowen, vnto whome the
same of right apperteined.</p>
<p>Those that were present, perceiuing to what issue his painted processe tended, and doubing
<note place="marg">The nobles through feare consented to create Gillus king.</note>
lest if they should s&eacute;eme to stand against him at that instant in this his demand, they migh
happilie be the first that should repent the bargaine, consented to proclaime him king: wherevpon he required all such as were present, to sweare vnto him fealtie, and to doo him homage
according to the custome. And herewith agr&eacute;eablie as he had before promised, and according
to his fathers will (as he alledged) he distributed among them all such cattell as belonged to his said
father. Whereby he wan the greater fauour of manie, but yet not iudging himselfe altogither
in suertie, by reason that Dothan had left behind him three sonnes, as then remaining in the Ile of
Man, in the bringing vp of the Druides, he purposed therefore to dispatch them also for the better
<note place="marg">Gillus goeth about to murther Dothans sonnes also.</note>
assurance of his estate, and therevpon he made a iournie thither himselfe, feigning as though
he meant nothing but all loue and fr&eacute;endlie affection towards the children, by which meanes
he gat two of them into his hands, the one named Lismorus, being about twelue yeeres of
age, and the other Cormacus that was two y&eacute;eres yoonger. The yoongest of the thr&eacute;e named
Ederus, being about seuen y&eacute;eres old, as his better hap was, chanced to be sicke at that time,
by reason whereof he escaped his hands: Gillus feigning as though he wished to haue the
other two brought vp like the children of a prince, he led them away with him into Scotland,
leauing certeine of his seruants behind him, to rid Ederus the yoongest out of the way at leisure; and as for the other twaine, the night following after his comming home to Dunstafage,
he caused them to be murthered, euen in their tutors armes, whose aid most pitifullie they 
<note place="marg">A detestable murther.</note>
besought and required. But the woman that had the k&eacute;eping of Ederus now in his sicknesse,
prouided more warilie for his safegard, for she smelling out what was the kings purpose, in
the dead of the night got hir selfe togither with Ederus into a ship, and passed ouer into 
<note place="marg">Ederus escapeth.</note>
Argile, where being set on land, she caried him on hir shoulders vp into the mounteinss and
there within a secret den susteined his languishing life for certeine moneths in great care and

<p>Gillus notwithstanding these his cruell acts, shewed yet in outward apperance that no man
<note place="marg">Gillus counterfeiteth a zeale to iustice.</note>
was more desirous of the quiet state and prosperous successe of the commonwealth than he:
euer reasoning among his nobles, and that in the presence of his commons touching the maintenance of iustice, &amp; punishment of misdooers, whereas he himselfe thirsted continuallie,
and most of all after the bloud of those whom he doubted anie thing likelie to attempt the
reuenge of his wicked misgouernance: insomuch that he caused in one place and other, all
such to be murthered and slaine as bare anie good will toward the lawfull line of Dursius.</p>
<p>Now the people s&eacute;eing the dailie slaughter of the nobilitie, and at the last growing to be

of this their conspiracie, assembled such puissance as he could make, &amp; hauing no other refuge but to trie the matter by battell, made towards his enimies with more sp&eacute;ed than good
successe: for yer the two armies came to ioining, a great number of Gillus his friends fled to

<p>This Cadall, immediatlie vpon the great authoritie giuen him, gat first all the best fortresses
into his hands, as Beregonium, Dunstafage, and other: then he passed ouer into the Ile of
Ila, to prouide the better for the resisting of Gillus, if he shuld attempt anie thing by purchasing aid amongst them of the westerne Iles. Thither was brought vnto him also, the yoong
Ederus (by such of Durstus his friends as had escaped the cruell hands of Gillus) whome Cadall caused to be honorablie conueied vnto Epiake the chiefest citie of Galloway, there to be
<note place="marg"><emph>Leland</emph> and other take Epiake not to be so farre north.</note>
brought vp in princelie nurture, that comming to full age, hee might the better be able to
take vpon him the gouernance.</p>
<p>In which meane while Gillus made all the friends in Ireland that he could, insomuch that
<note place="marg">Gillus purchaseth aid in Ireland.</note>
vpon such golden promises as he made vnto the chiefest gouernors there, they consented to
aid him with all their forces. Wherof Cadall being aduertised, he thought it best that a
king should be chosen, and thereby an vnitie to be framed amongst all the estates of the
realme, wherevpon causing a councell to be assembled for the same intent, by common agr&eacute;ement, one Ewin, a man of worthie fame, nephue to king Finnan by his brother Douall, was
<note place="marg">Ewin the second of that name chosen king.</note>
in the end proclaimed king: who was latelie come from the Ile of Gowere into Albion, in
companie with Cadall, and kept himselfe close hitherto within the said Ile, for doubt of Gillus
that sought amongst other to haue destroied him also.</p>
</div>
<div n="Ewin" type="section">
<head>EWIN.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">THIS</hi> Ewin, being the second of that name, made great prouision in the beginning of his
reigne to resist the said Gillus his enimie. And hearing that he had b&eacute;ene in the Ile of Ila,
and put the same to fire and swoord, he prepared an armie and ships also, to transport therewith ouer into Ireland, there to reuenge that iniurie vpon such as had aided Gillus therein
to the hinderance of his countrie. The forenamed Cadall gouernor of Galloway, was 
<note place="marg">Cadall with an armie is sent into Ireland.</note>
appointed also to haue the leading of this armie: who taking the sea at Dunstafage, directed his
course streight ouer vnto the coasts of Ireland, where taking land and encountering with his
enimies, he put them to the woorse, insomuch that Gillus fearing to fall into his aduersaries
hands, fled out of the field into the next wood, where he thought to haue saued himselfe. His
souldiers also perceiuing him to be fled, gaue ouer the field, and y&eacute;elded themselues vnto
Cadall, who tooke them to grace, and foorthwith sent out certeine companions to s&eacute;eke
Gillus, who found him in a den closed about with thicke woods and bushes, where he had
<note place="marg">Gillus taken.</note>
lien hid certeine daies, and was almost starued for hunger. Those that found him immediatlie stroke off his head, and presented the same vnto Cadall, to the great reioising of all the
<note place="marg">Gillus beheaded.</note>
companie.</p>
<p>Thus after that Cadall had atchiued his enterprise with good successe, he tooke the sea
<note place="marg">A shipwrack by a tempest.</note>
againe to returne into Scotland, but by meanes of a greeuous tempest, he lost the greatest
part of his armie, with all the spoile and riches that they had gotten in that voiage. Which
mischance sore blemished the glorie of so famous a victorie, so that the reioising of manie
was turned into dolefull moorning for the losse of their friends and kinsfolke, but namelie
Cadall tooke it so gr&eacute;euouslie, that nothing could be more offensiue vnto him. Howbeit,
<note place="marg">Cadall for his good &amp; faithful seruice is rewarded.</note>
after he was come on land, the king and other of the nobles recomforted him in all that they
might, and the king gaue him also much faire lands, with diuers castels in Galloway, in recompense of his good faithfull seruice at sundrie times shewed in defense of his countrie, and
made him gouernor of Galloway also, which he verie thankfullie accepted.</p>
<p>After this king Ewin came to an interuiew with the king of Picts in the borders of 
<note place="marg">An interview betwixt the kings of Scots and Picts.</note>
Galloway, and there renewed th' ancient leage betwixt the Scotish men and the Picts. For more
corroboration wherof Sijora the daughter of Gethus the third king of the Picts, was ioined
in marriage with Ederus, the solemnization being kept at Epiake. These things thus accomplished, Ewin returned to Duristafage, where being certified by letters from the lieutenant of
<note place="marg">The people of Orkney inuade Cathnesse.</note>
Rosse, that the Ilanders of Orkney had passed Pictland firth, and were entred into

<pb n="57"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"57"</fw>-->

Cathnesse, robbing and spoiling that countrie with a great part of Rosse, he leuied an armie with
all sp&eacute;ed, and hasted towards the enimies, constreining them by his sudden comming to fight
whether they would or not, hauing no leisure to get awaie, so that with small resistance they
were vanquished and chased, some into the mounteins, and other to the sea side: of whom
part escaped by botes ouer into their countries, the residue of them in this their sudden ouerthrow being either slaine, drowned, or taken. But Bladus the king of Orkeney, for that he
<note place="marg">Bladus king of Orkeney sleieth himself.</note>
would not come into his enimies hands, slue himselfe. And thus ended this enterprise against
the enimies of Orkeney: greatlie to the increase of Ewins fame amongst the Scotish nation.</p>
<p>After this he visited the west parts of his realme, and at the mouth of the riuer of Lochtey
he builded a citie which he named Enuerlochtey, infranchising the same with a sanctuarie
<note place="marg">Enuerlochtey is builded.</note>
for the refuge of offendors. This citie afterwards was much frequented with merchants of
France and Spaine, by reason of the great abundance of samons, herrings, and other fish
which was taken there. The old ruines of this citie in part remaine to be seene in that
place where it stood, euen to this day. He likewise built an other citie in the east part of
the realme n&eacute;ere to the water called Lochnesse, which he named Enuernesse, after the name
<note place="marg">Enuernesse builded.</note>
of the water. Whither in times past there resorted manie merchants of Germanie, with
such merchandize as the inhabitants of the countrie there stood in n&eacute;ed of, exchanging the
same with them for marterne skins, and other such furres, wherewith they made their returne. This citie is as yet remaining, and beareth the old name, rich and well stored with
diuers kinds of merchandize, so that this Ewin prooued a most famous prince for his worthie
exploits right fortunatelie atchiued both in peace and warre. And finallie vnderstanding
the death of his verie d&eacute;ere and intirelie beloued friend Cadall, he repaired vnto Epiake, as
<note place="marg">Cadall deceased.</note>
well to giue order for the pacifieng of his sonnes being at variance for their fathers inheritance, as also to doo the more honor to his friend now deceased, by erecting some monument
n&eacute;ere vnto his sepulchre. Comming therefore to Epiake, and setting an accord betwixt the
yoong men, he caused an image to be made in all points resembling the personage of Cadall,
as n&eacute;ere as might be: which he placed in the middest of the market steed, commanding the
same to be honored with burning of incense and other diuine ceremonies. Within a few
daies also, through inward sorrow, as was thought, for the losse of so d&eacute;ere a friend, he began to wax sicke himselfe, and at length perceiuing he should not escape present death, he
caused Ederus (of whom before mention is made) to be brought vnto him, into whose hands
with manie wholsome aduertisements how to vse himselfe in gouernement of his subiects, he
<note place="marg">Ewin resigneth the estate.</note>
wholie resigned the estate, the which after his deceasse he knew to be due vnto him without

<head>EDERUS.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">AFTER</hi> the decease of Ewin, Ederus was, in maner before expressed, receiued for king
by the whole assent of all the Scotishmen. Whose ch&eacute;efe delight was altogither in hunting

<note place="marg">Ederus burneth his enimies ships.</note>

by flight. The morning next following he did set vpon them also at vnwares: of whom
some he slue, and the residue being taken, either in the fight or chase by his commandement
were hanged, and cruellie executed to the example of all others.</p>
<p>After this, he passed ouer into the westerne Iles, where he did execution vpon such as
had aided Bredus, putting some to death, and causing other to fine at his pleasure, and depriuing some vtterlie of all that euer they had. At his returne againe into Scotland, there
<note place="marg">Cassibilane king of the Britains requireth of the Scotishmen aid against the Romans.</note>
met him ambassadors sent from Cassibilane king of the Britains, requiring him of aid against
Iulius Cesar, who (as the same king had perfect vnderstanding) was appointed verie shortlie
to passe the seas from France, ouer into this Ile, with a mightie power of Romans, to subdue
the inhabitants vnto the seigniorie and iurisdiction of Rome.</p>
<p>Ederus receiued these ambassadors verie courteouslie: and forsomuch as their maisters 
<note place="marg">Androgeus ch&eacute;efe ambassador of the Britains declareth the effect of his message.</note>
request required counsell, he caused his lords which were then present, to assemble togither
the next daie, afore whome he willed that Androgeus, cheefe of the British ambassadors,
should declare the effect of his message, which he did so eloquentlie, and vttering such sensible matter, how it stood the Scotishmen vpon to aid the Britains against such common enimies
to all nations as the Romans were, that in the end it was concluded by the king, with the
aduise of his nobles, that he should not onlie send a power to aid the Britains against the
Romans, but also send some of his lords with Androgeus and his associats vnto Gethus king
<note place="marg">The Scots grant to aid the Britains against the Romans.</note>
of the Picts, to mooue him to doo the like: who hearing how reasonable their demands were,
promised further to accomplish the same.</p>
<p>Thus the British ambassadors hauing sped according to their desires, repaired homewards:
immediatlie vpon whose departure, both the kings Ederus &amp; Gethus leuied their armies, &amp;
sent them foorth towards London, whereas then Cassibilane soiourned. I find that the Scors
were ten thousand men vnder the leading of Cadallane gouernor of Galloway, the sonne of

<note place="marg">5139 <emph>H. B.</emph></note>

Cadall before remembred, and one Douald gouernor of Argile. But what successe followed
of this first iournie which Cesar made into Britaine, ye shall find the same in the historie of
England more at length expressed. The y&eacute;ere that lulius Cesar came to inuade Britaine,
was the fourth of Ederus his reigne, from the creation of the world 3912 complet, which is
after Maister Harisons account 54 before the comming of our Sauiour, and 692 after the
building of Rome.</p>
<p>The Scotishmen and Picts hauing their part of the spoile which the Romans at their departure left behind them, were sent home to their countries with great thanks and rewards
for their pains, but the Briains were so exalted in pride by the departure of the Romans,
that they bel&eacute;eued verelie they shuld haue no more to doo with those enimies, or if they
had they thought themselues strong inough to repell them without aid of other. By meanes
wherof when king-Ederus was informed how the Romans prepared to inuade them afresh,
and had sent them word thereof, offering to them his aid: they made no account of that
<note place="marg">The Britains refuse aid being offered them.</note>
offer, but answered that it was not necessarie, for euerie light inuasion of forren enimies, to
s&eacute;eke helpe at other mens hands, being of puissance sufficient of themselues to resist the
same well inough.</p>
<p>But of this refusall of so friendlie an offer, it was not long yer the Britains sore repented
them. For shortlie after Iulius Cesar with a farre greater power than that which he brought
<note place="marg">Iulius Cesar inuadeth this land the second time.</note>

<note place="marg">The Britains are ouerthrowne.</note>
with him at the first time, landed here in this Ile amongst them againe: and being at thr&eacute;e
sundrie times fiercelie incountred by king Cassibilane, at length he put the same Cassibilane
with his Britains to flight, slaieng and taking a great number of them. Amongst other of
the prisoners were thr&eacute;e of their cheefest capteins, Androgeus, Cisentoriges, and Tenantius.
By reason of which ouerthrow Cassibilane was so discouraged, that doubting further misch&eacute;efe, he y&eacute;elded himselfe vnto Cesar, accepting such conditions of peace as were appointed
him, and for performance of couenants, deliuered sufficient pledges.</p>

<p>Cesar hauing thus conquered the Britains, sent his ambassadors vnto the kings of the
<note place="marg">Iulius Cesar his message to the Scots and Picts.</note>
Scotishmen and Picts, requiring them to submit themselues as Cassibilane had doone, or
else he bad them looke for open warres at the Romans hands, which they might assure themselues they should in no wise be able to susteine, considering their mightie and huge puissance, hauing the most part of the whole world at their commandement alreadie. 
<note place="marg">The answer of the Scots and Picts vnto Cesar his ambassadors.</note>
Wherevnto aswell the one king as the other made this or much-what the like answer, that they were
bent sooner to lose their liues than their libertie. Which their resolution, if they were put

<p>Cesar hauing receiued this answer from these two nations, he sendeth new messengers
<note place="marg">Cesar sendeth new messengers vnto the Scots and Picts, but they sp&eacute;ed much like to the former.</note>
vnto them with a more rough message, who not onlie by threats but also by great reasons
went about to persuade them vnto submission. But they persisting in their former opinion
for defense of their liberties, and vtterlie refusing all maner of bondage, would incline by
no meanes to come in any bond of fr&eacute;endship with the Romans. After the returne of these
last messengers, Cesar was fullie resolued to enter into their countries, to force them vnto that
by dint of sword, wherevnto by treatie he might not induce them: and had set forward on
that iournie shortlie after ind&eacute;ed, if he had not b&eacute;ene called backe into France, to pacifie
sundrie commotions there raised by the reuolting of the people inhabiting in those countries,
where the Picards and Normans, with other the inhabitants n&eacute;ere about Chartres doo now
dwell.</p>
<p>The common Scotish chronicles record, how Iulius Cesar came as far as Kalendar wood,
<note place="marg">Kalendar or Caledon wood.</note>

<note place="marg">This cannot be true, for Cesar came not n&eacute;er Scotland, as in the historie of England it app&eacute;ereth.</note>
and there wan by force the citie of Camelon, where the Pictish kings vsed most to soiourne.
Herevnto the same chronicles adde, that Cesar builded a great stonehouse of 24 cubits in
heigth, &amp; of 12 cubits in bredth, of square hewen stones, right workemanlie framed, which
house they saie Cesar caused to be vsed in steed of a iudgement hall, and here placed it n&eacute;ere
the riuer of Caron, ouer against the forenamed citie of Camelon, as a witnesse that the Romans armie had b&eacute;ene so far forward within that countrie. Such an house there remaineth
to be s&eacute;ene euen vnto this daie, and is called Iulius hoff, that is Iulius hall, or Iulius court.
<note place="marg">Iulius hoff.</note>
Howbeit, other more agr&eacute;eable to the likeliehood of a truth, write that this house was sometimes a temple builded to the honor of Claudius Cesar, and of the goddes Victoria, by the
Romane capteine Vespasian, at such time as he made wars in that countrie, before his aduancement to the empire.</p>
<p>But to returne vnto Ederus. About the same time, in which he looked to be inuaded by
Iulius Cesar and the Romans, and for that purpose had sent for them of the westerne Iles to
reinforce his host, he was now inforced to conuert it another waie, for there was one Murketus,
<note place="marg">Murketus nephue vnto Gillus inuadeth the westerne Iles.</note>
nephue vnto the aboue remembred Gillus, that came with a nauie out of Ireland to rob and
spoile those Iles, being destitute as then of men to resist him. But Ederus hearing thereof,
dispatched Cadallanus with an armie into those parties for defense of his subiects: which
Cadallanus behaued himselfe so politikelie in this exploit, that setting vpon the enimies as
they laie at anchor, he tooke them in the night season, without making any great defense, and
after hanged them vp along the shore side within the Ile of Gowre: Murket himself being
<note place="marg">Murket is hanged with manie more.</note>

<note place="marg">48 <emph>H. B.</emph></note>

<note place="marg">26 <emph>H. B.</emph></note>
honored with an higher place to hang in than all the rest, as due to him that was their ch&eacute;efe
head and leader in that voiage. The remnant of Ederus his reigne passed without anie
other notable trouble: and so after he had reigned 38 yeeres, he deceased a verie old man,
about the 23 yeare of the empire of Augustus Cesar. He was buried also at Dunstafage
with all due pompe &amp; solemnitie, hauing diuers obelisks (as the custome then was) erected

tooke him prisoner, being destitute of all aid and succors: for such as he brought with him,
not once offered to strike one stroke in his quarell. Ewin being thus taken, was by and by
<note place="marg">Ewin condemned to perpetual prison.</note>
condemned to perpetuall prison; and Cadallan, of whom ye haue heard before, immedialie
proclamed gouernor of the realme. Howbeit the night following, after that Ewin (according to the iudgement pronounced against him) was committed vnto ward, 2 presumptuous

inclosed, and there strangled him. But in st&eacute;ed of thanks he was recompensed with death:
for Cadallan detesting such a wicked d&eacute;ed, caused him to be hanged in open sight of all
men. Such was the end of Ewih, being thus dispatched in prison, in the seuenth y&eacute;ere after
he began his reigne ouer the Scotishmen, being the 9 y&eacute;ere of Augustus Cesar his gouernment of the Romane empire.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">AFTER</hi> Ewin succ&eacute;eded Merellanus, son to one Carren, the brother of Ederus a prince of
most gentle behauiour. This Metellanus mainteined his subiects in great quietnesse and
rest, without anie maner of wars, either forren or ciuill. Such wicked lawes as his predecessor had established, he did what he could to abolish. But such yoong gentlemen as
delighted in sensuall lust, and licentious libertie, stood so stiffelie therein against him, that
in the end he was glad to leaue off his purpose. About the same time also there came vnto
Kimbaline king of the Britains an ambassador from Augustus the emperor, with thanks,
<note place="marg">Kimbaline king of the Britains.</note>
for that entring into the gouernement of the British state, he had kept his allegiance toward
the Romane empire: exhorting him to keepe his subiects in peace with all their neighbors,
sith the whole world, through meanes of the same Augustus, was now in quiet, without all
warres or troublesome tumults.</p>
<p>These ambassadors went also vnto Metellanus the K. of the Scotishmen, exhorting him
to acknowledge a superioritie in the Romane emperour, vnto whome the people inhabiting
in the furthest parts of the east, had sent their ambassadors with rich iewels to present his
person withall. Wherwith Metellanus being partlie mooued to haue a freendlie amitie with
<note place="marg">Metellanus becommeth friend to the Romans.</note>

the capitoll, in signe of honour, by which means he obteined an amitie with the Romans,
which continued betwixt them and his kingdome for a long time after.</p>

hauing considered the effect of this message, gaue counsell to the Britains to send into France
then called Gallia, to practise with the people there to moue some rebellion against the
Romans, in hope of helpe, which they were assured to haue by the Britains. This counsell
was followed, for immediatlie vpon the ambassadours returne, there were sent ouer into
France certeine intelligenciaries to moue some conspiracie which had taken effect (by reason
of the generall hate of seruitude, wherein the Romans kept the people subiect to them in

to conquere the same, for that they had aided the Britains in these last warres against the

Orkenies, it is not like that he came there at all, for if he staied not past 16 daies in Britaine,
as by Dion Cassius it appeareth that he did not in d&eacute;ed; how should we imagine that he
could both pacifie the south parts of Britaine, and after go into Orkenie and conquere the
same within so small a time, being readie to returne towards Rome at the end of those 16
daies, as the said Dion affirmeth ? But this discourse haue I made according to their owne

errours, as the maner is of them as well as of other nations, which to aduance their antiquities and glorie of their ancestors, take the aduantage oftentimes of writers scant woorthie
of credit.</p>
<p>But now againe to our purpose. Aruiragus being established in the kingdome of Britaine,
<note place="marg">Aruiragus forsaketh his lawfull wife.</note>
vpon some priuat displeasure forsooke his wife named Voada, the sister of Caratake king
of the Scotishmen, and maried Genissa a Romane ladie, which act manie of the Britans disallowed; the more in deed, because he had faire issue alreadie by Voada, as a son and two
daughters. But this was doone, as all men iudged, by the counsell of Aulus Planctius,
thereby to breake all friendship and aliance betwixt the Britains and the Scots, to the end
that in no case of rebellion they should ioine their powers togither. Neither did he onelie
refuse Voada, whome all men knew to be his lawfull wife, but also caused hir to be kept in
<note place="marg">Voada imprisoned.</note>

<note place="marg">Voada is deliuered out of prison, and conueied into Wales.</note>
prison, till that the Britains (hauing indignation thereat) got hir out of the place where she
was kept, and conueied hir into Wales togither with hir children.</p>
<p>With which dealing Aruiragus being highlie moued, determined with force of armes to
punish them that had thus misused him: but perceiuing that not onelie those people which
inhabited the countrie, now called Wales, and other that adioined on the north marches
thereof were readie to defend the queene against his malice, he was faine to require aid of
the Romans, who with their capteine Aulus Planctius assembling togither with such of the
Britains as tooke part with Aruiragus, set forward toward the enimies, and ioining with them
in battell, did giue them the ouerthrow. The next day after this victorie thus gotten, word

<note place="marg">A commotion against Aruiragus.</note>
was brought that the people inhabiting in the countries which we now call Lanchashire,
Yorkeshire, and Darbishire, were vp in armour against the king and the Romans, by reason
whereof Aruiragus and Aulus Planctius withdrew towards London, that defending the sea
coasts towards France, they might yet haue the sea open at all times whatsoeuer chanced.
And to re-enforce their power, Aulus Planctius sent ouer for two legions of souldiers into
France, to come with all sp&eacute;ed to his aid.</p>
<p>The Britains, who had gone so farre in the matter that they could not well withdraw 
<note place="marg">The Britains make themselues strong.</note>
themselues, now being certified of all their enimies dooings, thought best to make themselues
so strong as was possible. And to the end that they might proc&eacute;ed in some orderlie meane,
all the greatest lords and estates assembled togither at Shrewsburie, in those daies called

Coriminum, where they concluded vpon a league to aid one another with all their might and

subiection and thraldome of the same Romans. They being thus agr&eacute;ed to make warres in
this quarrell, and for the same purpose to ioine their whole puissance togither, there rose a doubt
whome they might choose for their generall capteine, for that it was feared least there might
grow some secret enuie amongest the nobles being of equali power, if one should be in this
case preferred before an other. For the auoiding of which mischiefe, by the graue admonition
of one Comus a noble man of the parties of Wales, they accorded to send messengers vnto

to the end, such children as he had by Genissa (for that they were of the Romane bloud)

confederat in this enterprise, had chosen him by common assent to be their generall and
chiefe leader, if it might so please him to take it vpon him, as their trust was he would:
considering the iust causes of their warre, and the suertie which by victorie gotten might
insue vnto all the inhabitants of the whole lie of Albion.</p>
<p>Caratake hauing heard the summe of their request, and throughlie weieng the same, 
<note place="marg">Caratake promised aid to the Britains.</note>
promised them to be readie with his whole puissance in the beginning of the next spring, to come
to their aid, vnto what place soeuer they should thinke expedient: and thereof he told them
they might be most assured, willing them in the meane time so to prouide for themselues,
as their enimies might haue no aduantage at their hands. With this agreeable answere the
British messengers returned to Shrewsburie to the confederats, who reioising at the news,
made prouision against the next spring to go against the Romans, in hope of good successe,
speciallie through aid of the Scots and Picts, who also with their king called Conkist were
<note place="marg">The Picts ioine with Scots and Britains against the Romans.</note>
willing to helpe towards the deliuering of the land from bondage of the Romans, whose
nestling so neere their noses they were loth to s&eacute;e or heare of. So soone therefore as the
spring approched, all those thr&eacute;e people, Britains, Scots, and Picts, gathered their powers
together, and met in Yorkeshire, in purpose to incounter with their enimies in battell, wheresoeuer they found them.</p>
<p>Aruiragus and Aulus Planctius hauing knowledge of all the dooings of the confederats,
likewise assembled their power, &amp; comming towards them, for a while forebare to ioine in
battell, through counsell of Planctius, who perceiuing the most part of the Britains and
Scots to be but new souldiers, taken vp of late to fill the numbers, knew that by protracting
time they would be soone out of heart, through watching and euill harborough, in such
sort that in the end they should be easie inough to deale with; and euen so it came to
passe. For the Romans refusing to fight a generall battell, yet scoured so the fields on ech
<note place="marg">The Britains wearid through trauell.</note>
side abroad, that neither the Britains nor Scots could go forth anie waies for forage or
vittels, but they were still snatched vp, so that what through hunger, lacke of sl&eacute;epe, and
other diseases, manie of the Britains began to conueie themselues from the campe home to
their houses, of whome some being taken by the enimies, declared that the whole armie of
the confederats was in great distresse, and sore inf&eacute;ebled by such vnaccustomed trauell and
diseases as they were inforced vnto in the campe. Wherevpo Aruiragus and Aulus Planctus
determined the next day to giue battell. And so in the morning they arraied their people,
&amp; marched foorth betimes towards the campe of the confederats.</p>
<p>Caratake, who (as ye haue heard) was generall of all the confederates, vnderstanding the
<note place="marg">The Romans giue battell to the Britains.</note>
enimies intent, was as readie to receiue battell as they were to offer it; wherevpon there
insued right great and vnmercifull slaughter betwixt them on both parts, without sparing
any at all, till such time as the night parted the fraie, with such losse on either side, that
<note place="marg">Night parteth the fray.</note>
after they were once got in sunder, neither part had anie hast afterwards to ioine againe:
so that in the morning there appeared none in the field but onelie the dead bodies, those
that were left aliue as well on the one part as the other being fled and scattered into the
woods and mounteins. Aruiragus and Planctius got them vnto London: and Caratake
<note place="marg">Caratake returneth home to Carictonium.</note>

<note place="marg">Ambassadors are sent vnto Caratake from Aulus Planctius.</note>
commanding his people home each man into his countrie, he himselfe withdrew first towards Yorke, and after vnto the citie of Carrike; whither shortlie after there came vnto him
ambassadors from Aulus Pianctius, sent to know vpon what occasion he did aid the British
rebels against the Romane empire, declaring that if he would not be conformable to make a
woorthie amends for so presumptuous an enterprise, he should be sure to haue the Romans
his enimies; and that in such wise, as he should perceiue, it were much better for him to
s&eacute;eke their friendship, than to abide their enimitie.</p>
<p>Herevnto Caratake answered, that he had iust cause to doo that which he did, considering

the iniuries which his sister Voada with hir sonne Guiderius had and were like to receiue
by their counsell and meanes: and therefore he was so little minded to make anie amends

out of the whole possession of Britaine, either else they might assure themselues to haue
aswell the Britains, as also the Scots &amp; Picts to be their perpetuall enimies, and that onelie
for the chalenge of their ancient liberties and fr&eacute;edome. The Romane ambassadors being
returned with this answer, Planctius tooke no small indignation thereat, sore menacing to
be reuenged of so high and contumelious words pronounced against the maiestie of the
Romane empire.</p>
<p>About the same time Aruiragus, vpon trust conceiued by ioining his power with the other
confederate Britains, to expell the Romans quite out of the realme, and so to recouer the
intire estate, reuolting from them, fled into Shrewsburie, where, at the same time such British
<note place="marg">Aruiragus reuolteth.</note>
lords as were enimies to the Romans, were assembled againe in councell, by whom Aruiragus
was receiued with great gladnesse (ye maie be sure) of those lords, trusting by his meanes
to haue their force in maner doubled. His wife Genissa being at the same season great with
child, tooke such thought for this reuolting of hir husband, that trauelling before hir time,
<note place="marg">Genissa the wife of Aruiragus dieth.</note>

<note place="marg">A messenger sent vnto Claudius the emperor from Planctius.</note>
she immediatly died therwith. But Aulus Planctius, perceiuing now thoroughlie how little
trust there was to be put in the Britans, dispatched a messenger in all hast with letters vnto
Claudius the emperour, who as then soiourned at Rome, signifieng vnto him in what danger the state of Britaine stood, if timelie prouision were not the sooner made.</p>
<p>Claudius weieng the matter by good aduise of councell, ordeined by decr&eacute;e of the senate,
that Vespasian (of whome ye haue heard before) should be sent hither with an armie, to
tame the proud and loftie stomachs of the Britains, with their confederats the Scots &amp; Picts.
Vespasian herevpon departing from Rome, came into France, &amp; increasing his legions, with
<note place="marg">Vespasian commeth into Britaine.</note>
a supplie of such souldiers as he found there, passed ouer into this our Britaine, where contrarie to the report which he had heard afore his comming, he found euerie fortresse so well
furnished after the warlike order of the Romane vsage, and moreouer all such companies
of men of warre as kept the field so well appointed and ordered, that he could not but
much praise the great diligence and politike gouernement of Planctius.</p>
<p>Now when Vespasian had a little refreshed his men, and taken order how to proc&eacute;ed in
the reducing of the Britains to their former obedience, he set forward toward Aruiragus &amp;
other the enimies, whom he vnderstood as then to be at Yorke, making their assemblies
not generallie of all that were able to beare a club, as they did the yeere before; but out of
<note place="marg">The Britains gather an armie.</note>
all parties a chosen number of piked men were sent for, as out of Deuonshire &amp; Cornewall
there came 6000, foorth of Wales and the marches 12000, and the like number out of
Kendall, Westmerland, and Cumberland. Out of Oxfordshire and other the parties of
<note place="marg">Iceni.</note>
Britaine subiect vnto Aruiragus, there came 35000. All which numbers assembled nere
vnto Yorke, euerie man bringing his prouision with him to serue him for two moneths space.
Vnto the same place came also Caratake with 30000 Scotish men : and Illithara otherwise

<note place="marg">Illithara or Tharan king of Picts.</note>
called Tharan, king of the Picts, with almost as manie of his subiects.</p>
<p>Vespasian being certified still from time to time of all the dooings of his enimies, hasted
with all sp&eacute;ed towards them; and by the leading of trustie guides comming to the place
where they were incamped within a marish ground not passing 12 miles from Yorke, he
fiercelie vpon a sudden setteth vpon them within their campe, yer they thought he had

b&eacute;ene n&eacute;ere them. But yet notwithstanding they manfullie stood to their defense: insomuch that those in the right wing of the Romans armie were like to haue beene distressed,
if Vespasian perceiuing the danger, had not sent a legion to their aid in time, wherby the
battell was newlie in that part restored. The capteins on either side did what they could to
incourage their folkes to sticke to their tackle, without giuing ouer by anie meanes, considering
what gaine came by victorie, and what losse insued by receiuing the ouerthrow.</p>
<p>The Britains, Scots, and Picts, like inraged lions, ran vpon the Romans, with such cruell

desire of' reuenge, that euen when they were thrust through vpon the point of any weapon,
they would run still vpon the same, to come vnto him that held it, that they might requite
him with the like againe. But yet would not all that their fierce and desperate hardinesse
preuaile, for fortune by fatall appointment being bent to aduance the Romans vnto the

dominion of the whole world, shewed hir selfe so fauourable vnto them in this battell, that in the
end, though the Britains with the confederats did what lay in men to doo for atteining of 
<note place="marg">The Britains receiue the ouerthrow.</note>
victorie, yet were they beaten downe and slaine euerie mothers sonne, a few onelie excepted,
which escaped by flight.</p>
<p>Aruiragus s&eacute;eing the slaughter of his people, would haue slaine himselfe, but that some of
his seruants caried him by force out of the field, that h&eacute;e might be reserued yet vnto some better fortune. Caratake escaping by flight, fled into his countrie, but Tharan king of the Picts,
<note place="marg">Caratake escapeth.</note>

<note place="marg">Tharan king of the Picts is slaine.</note>
not coueting to liue after such losse of his people, threw away his armor with all his kinglie ornaments, and sitting downe vpon a stone, as a man past himselfe, was there slaine by such as
followed in the chase. Aruiragus being conueied out of danger, and gotten into Yorke, considered how by reason of this great discomfiture, it was vnpossible to resist the Romane puissance, and therefore with consent of the residue of his nobles that were escaped from the battell, he sent an herald vnto Vespasian, offring to submit himselfe in most humble wise vnto anie
<note place="marg">Messengers sent by Aruiragus vnto Vespasian with submission.</note>
reasonable conditions of peace and agr&eacute;ement. Wherevpon Vespasian commanded that Aruiragus should in priuate apparell come in vnto him, for he would not talke of anie peace, except
he had Aruiragus present, and therefore he sent vnto him his safe conduct to assure him safetie both to come and go.</p>
<p>Aruiragus s&eacute;eing no other remedie, came in vnto Vespasian, according to his appointment,

and vpon his submission was pardoned of all his trespasse, and placed againe in the kingdome.
The cities and good townes also that were partakers in the rebellion, were in semblable wise
forgiuen without fining or other indemnitie, and so likewise were all the nobles of the countrie. Howbeit, for the better assurance of their loialtie in time to come, they deliuered new
hostages. Their ancient lawes also were abrogated, and the Romane lawes in their place
established. For the administration of the which, in euerie prouince was appointed a Romane
iudge to s&eacute;e good orders obserued according to the forme thereof. By which meanes the
British nation eftsoones returned vnto hir former obedience of the Romane empire. All the
winter following, Vespasian laie at Yorke, making his apprests against the next spring to go
against the Scots and Picts. So soone therefore as the summer was come, Vespasian setteth
forward with his armie, and entering into the marches of his enimies, he did put them in such
feare that the Picts were glad to y&eacute;eld themselues vnto him, a few of the nobles &amp; some
other excepted, which were withdrawne into Camelon, in hope through strength of that town
to defend themselues from all assaults. Vespasian being certified therof, came &amp; besieged
them within the same citie, not minding to depart till he had them at his pleasure. This siege

themselues with the town into Vespasians hands. In this town were found all the regall ornaments, as the crowne &amp; sword, with other iewels belonging to the kings of the Picts. The
sword hauing the haft of gold, &amp; a purple scabberd very finely wrought &amp; trimmed, Vespasian
vsed to weare in all the warres wherin he afterwards chanced to be, in hope (I wot not) of
what good successe and lucke to follow therof. The Pictish lords which were within Camelon, were commanded to deliuer pledges: and after licenced to depart without anie other damage. Vespasian himselfe remaining at Camelon, tooke order for the peopling of the towne

<p>Whilest he was thus occupied, tidings came to him, that Caratake king of the Scotishmen
had assembled in Galloway a great army of Scots, Picts and Britains, in purpose against the
Romans, to reuenge the last ouerthrow. Whervpon Vespasian with all speed sent foorth a
strong power vnder the leading of Aulus Planctius to incounter the enimies. Planctius being
approched within foure miles of them, incamped himselfe in a strong place, as though he minded not to passe further, till Vespasian with the rest of his whole puissance were come to his
aid. Neuerthelesse, night was no sooner come on, but that he gaue generall commandement

through his host, that euerie man should make him readie to depart at a certeine houre vnder
the standards of their capteins in order of battell.</p>
<p>Then in the second watch of the night he set forward, following certeine guides (which knew
<note place="marg">Planctius setteth vpon the Scotish campe.</note>
all the straits and passages of the countrie) till he came to the place where Caratake with his
armie was lodged: and first killing the watch which stood to defend his entrance, till the armie was raised, he set vpon the whole campe, and though he found such resistance that the
battell continued right fierce &amp; cruell from the dawning of the day, till it was hie noone, yet
in the end the victorie remained with the Romans; and the Scots with the Picts, &amp; such Britains as were on their part, put to flight and chased. Caratake escaping out of the battell, fled
<note place="marg">Caratake flieth vnto Dunstafage.</note>
into Argile, and got him to the castell of Dunstafage. Diuerse of the Britains &amp; Picts, which
as yet had not submitted themselues, were put in such dread through brute of this ouerthrow,
that immediatlie therevpon they came in and y&eacute;elded themselues vnto Vespasian. And in
<note place="marg">The people of Galloway submit themselues to the Romans.</note>
semblable wise the people of Galloway vtterlie despairing any longer to defend their countrie
against Planctius (who was now entred into their confines, and had taken the citie of Carrike)
offred to become subiects vnto the Romans, which they might neuer be brought vnto before
that time.</p>
<p>These newes being certified vnto Vespasian by a purseuant, he rode streightwaies vnto
Carrike, &amp; there receiued the oths of the nobles, and other the inhabitants of the countrie.
That done, he sent ambassadors vnto Caratake, to trie if he might by anie meanes to become
<note place="marg">Ambassadors sent vnto Caratake.</note>

<note place="marg">Caratake vtterlie refuseth to become a subject.</note>
friend vnto the Romane empire, in acknowledging some maner of subiection therevnto : but
this deuise was to small purpose, for Caratake was determined rather to end his life as a fr&eacute;e
Scotishman in defense of libertie, than to become thrall vnto anie forreine nation, in hope to
liue long time in seruitude, doubting least if he came anie waies foorth into danger of the Romans, they would vsurpe the whole dominion vnto themselues. Whose mind when Vespasian
vnderstood by his answer made to the ambassadors which were sent vnto him, he was minded to haue gone with an armie vnto Dunstafage where Caratake lay, but that he was informed
what dangerous passages he must march thorough, all full of desart mounteins, bogs, and
quauemires, without anie prouision of vittels or forrage to b&eacute;e found by all the way as the armie
should passe.</p>
<p>Leauing therfore this enterprise, he caused so manie vessels to be assembled, as could be
prouided on all parts, purposing to haue passed ouer into the Ile of Man, into the which there
were gotten togither a great sort of Britains and Picts, that had escaped the Romans hands.
But this iournie also was broken by another incident, for euen at the same time, newes were
<note place="marg">The Ile of Wight rebelleth.</note>
brought that the Britains of the Ile of Wight, with the Kentishmen, and diuerse others the inhabitants vpon the south coast, were reuolted, and had slaine diuerse Romans, which lay in
garisons in those parts. Vespasian therefore minding to cure this wound yer it should 
<note place="marg">Vespasian appeaseth the rebels.</note>
throughlie fester, hasted thither with all sp&eacute;ed, and with litle a dob pacifieng the rebels, caused the
chiefe offendors to be punished according to their deserts.</p>
<p>Shortlie after being sent for by the emperour Claudius, he returned vnto Rome with great

<note place="marg">Planctius left as gouernor.</note>

<note place="marg">Planctius prepareth to m&eacute;et the Scots.</note>
glorie for his noble and high atchiued victories. Aulus Planctius was left in charge with the
gouernement of Britaine after Vespasians departure: who hearing that Caratake had assembled a great armie of Scots, and other such Britains and Picts as had not yet submitted themselues vnto the Romans, in purpose to recouer againe those countries which Vespasian had
latelie conquered, he likewise prepared to meet them, so that both the armies incountering togither, there was fought a right terrible battell with great slaughter on both parties, till finallie
the victorie inclining to the Romans, more through skilfull policie than puissant force, the
<note place="marg">The Romans through policie vanquish the Scotishmen.</note>
Scots, Picts, and Britains were discomfited and chased into the bogs and marishes, the common refuge in those daies for the Scots, when by anie adventure they chanced to be put to
flight.</p>
<p>After this ouerthrow the warre was continued for two y&eacute;ers space, by rodes and incursions
made one vpon another in the confines of Kile and Galloway. In which meane while

Planctius fell sicke of the flix, which still continuing with him, brought him at length in such case,

that he was not able to trauell at all in the publike affaires of his office. So that he wrote his
letters vnto the emperour Claudius, signifieng vnto him in what case he stood, and therevpon
required that some sufficient personage might be sent to occupie his roome. Claudius hauing
receiued his letters, and vnderstanding the effect of the same, sent one Ostorius Scapula, a man
<note place="marg">Ostorius Scapula is sent into Britaine.</note>
of high linage, and of good experience both in peace and war, to haue the gouernance in
Britaine.</p>
<p>About the time of whose arriuall into Britaine, Aulus Planctius departed out of this world
<note place="marg">Aulus Planctius dieth.</note>
at Camelon, where he then soiourned. His bodie was burned, and according to the vsage of
the Romans in those daies, the ashes were closed in a chest, and buried within the church of
Claudius and Victoria, which (as is said) Vespasian builded n&eacute;ere vnto Camelon, vpon the
riuers side there. Hereof was a custome taken vp amongst both Scots and Picts (as some
<note place="marg">The vsage amongst the Scots to burne the dead bodie.</note>
thinke) to burne the bodies of the dead, and to burie the ashes: whereof there haue bene
found diuerse tokens and monuments in this our age. As in the yere 1521 at Findor a village
in Merne, fiue miles distant from Aberdine, there were found in an old graue two chests
of a strange making full of ashes, either of them being ingrauen with Romane letters, which so
soone as they were brought into the aire, fell to dust. Likewise in the fields of another towne
called Kenbacten in Marre, ten miles distant from Aberdine, about the same time were found
by certeine plowmen two sepulchres made of cut and squared stones, wherein were foure
chests, of workemanship, bignesse and inscription like to the other two. Manie the semblable monuments haue b&eacute;ene found in diuerse places in Scotland in times past: but it is to be
thought, that in these sepulchres there were Romans buried, and neither Scots nor Picts.</p>
<p>But now to our purpose. Immediatelie vpon the comming of Ostorius into Britaine, the
people of the west countries rebelled, procuring the northerne men with the Scots of 
<note place="marg">The Britains yet eftsoones rebell.</note>

<note place="marg">The Britains require aid of Caratake.</note>
Galloway, and all the Picts to doo the like. They sent also vnto Caratake, requiring him in this
common quarell against the Romans to put to his helping hand for recouerie of the ancient libertie of the whole land of Albion, considering it was like they should match well
inough with this new Romane capteine Ostorius Scapula, that vnderstood little of the maners
and vsages of the Britains. But this notwithstanding, Ostorius being informed of all these
practises, and remembring what furtherance it were for a capteine in the begining to win a
name by some praise-woorthie enterprise, he made first towards the westerne Britains, whome
<note place="marg">The Britains of the west part are chased.</note>
he thought to surprise yer they should assemble with the other rebels, and so m&eacute;eting with
them, he chased and tooke a great number of them, as they fled here and there out of all order.</p>
<p>After this, he went against the people called Iceni, which (as some thinke) inhabited the
<note place="marg">Iceni.</note>

<note place="marg">Oxfordshire is assailed.</note>

<note place="marg">Some take the Iceni to be the Northfolke men.</note>
countrie now called Oxfordshire, but other take them to be Northfolke men, who being gathered togither, were gotten into a strong place, inclosed about with a great ditch as they vse
to fense pasture grounds, that no horssemen should breake in vpon them : yet this notwithstanding, Ostorius assailed them within their strength, &amp; in the end breaking downe the rampire, with such aid as he had, burst in at length amongst them, sleaing and taking the most
part of them: for few or none escaped, they were so kept in on ech side. But of this battell,
and likewise of other enterprises, which Ostorius and other of the Romane lieutenants atchiued
here in Britaine, ye shall find more thereof in the historie of England according to the true
report of the Romane writers, the which verelie make no mention either of Scots or Picts till
the y&eacute;ere of our Lord 320, at the soonest. And as for the Silures and Brigants remooued by
Hector Boetius so farre northward, it is euidentlie prooued by Humfrey Llhoid, and others,
that they inhabited countries conteined now within the limits of England. The like ye haue
to vnderstand of the Ordouices where Caratake gouerned as king, and not in Carrike, as to
the well aduised reader I doubt not but it may sufficientlie appeare, as well in the description
as in the historie of England aforesaid.</p>
<p>But now to returne where we left: the brute of this late victorie quieted the busie minds of
<note place="marg">They of Galloway are beaten and pacified.</note>
such other of the Britains, as were readie to haue reuolted. But they of Galloway would not

soone pacified. After this he entred into the confines of Kile and Cantire, spoiling and

<note place="marg">Caratake assembleth an armie.</note>
wasting those countries, and brought from thence a great number of captiues. With which iniurie Caratake being not a little kindled, he assembled a mightie armie, wherein he had at the
least 40 thousand men, what of his owne subjects and other such as came to his aid. For after
he was entred into Pictland, there came vnto him out of all parties no small number, of such as
desired either to be reuenged on the Romans, either else to loose life and libertie both at once,
for the tast of bondage was so bitter vnto all the inhabitants of Albion in this season, that they
in maner were wholie conspired togither to remooue that yoke of thraldome from their shoulders which so painfullie pinched them.</p>
<p>Caratake thus furnished with an armie, chose foorth a strong place to lodge in, fensed on the

stones, in places where there was any way to enter. All such women as were somewhat stept
in age, and came thither with them, in great numbers, were by Caratake placed on either side
his battels, both as well to incourage the men to doo valiantlie with shouting and hallowing
vnto them, as also to assaile the Romans with stones as they should approch. Other such as
were yoong and lustie, were appointed to k&eacute;epe araie amongst the men to fight in the battell.</p>
<p>Caratake hauing thus ordered his field, and hearing that Ostorius was come to giue battell,
exhorted his people to sticke to it like men, and so in semblable wise did all his capteins and
sergeants of the bands, going from ranke to ranke to incourage their souldiors, declaring how
that this was the armie that must either bring libertie or thraldome to them and their posteritie
for euer. On the other part Ostorius minding to trie the matter by battell, set his people in
araie after the ancient maner of the Romans, willing them to consider that they were descended
<note place="marg">Ostorius incourageth his Romans.</note>
of those parents and ancestors which had subdued the whole world : and againe, that those with
whome they should now match, were but naked people, fighting more with a certeine maner
of a furious rage and disordered violence, than with any politike discretion or constancie.</p>
<p>Herewith vpon commandement giuen on both parts, the battell began right hot, &amp; for a
<note place="marg">Caratake ouerthrowne by the Romans.</note>
good space verie doubtfull, till the practised knowledge of the Romans vanquished the furious
violence of the Scots, Picts, and Britains: who being put to flight fled into the mounteins to
escape the enimies hands who pursued them most egerlie. Amongst other of the prisoners

there was taken Caratakes wife, with his daughter &amp; brethren. He himselfe fled for succor

taken and deliuered vnto Ostorius. This was in the ninth yeare after the beginning of the
warres. Ostorius vsed him verie honorablie, according to the degr&eacute;e of a king: finallie he
<note place="marg">Caratake is sent to Rome.</note>
sent him vnto Rome, togither with his wife, his daughter, and brethren. His fame was such
through all places, that where he passed by, the people came flocking in on each side to see
him, of whom they had heard so much report for his stout resistance made so long a time
against the Romane puissance.</p>
<p>At his comming to Rome he was shewed in triumph, all the people being called to the sight:
<note place="marg">He is shewed to the people in triumph.</note>
for the victorie and apprehension of him was iudged equall with anie other atchiued enterprise
against whatsouer the most puissant enimies of former time. The Emperor Claudius vpon respect
as was thought of his princelie behauior and notified valiancie, restored him to libertie, and reteining his daughter and eldest brother at Rome as pledges, vpon his oth receiued to be a true
subiect vnto the empire, he sent him home into his countrie againe, assigning vnto him the gouernance of Galloway, with Kile, Carrike, and Coningham. He liued not passing two y&eacute;eres
after his returne into Scotland, studieng most cheeflie (during that time) how to preserue his

<p>A little before his falling into the hands of the Romans, there were sundrie strange sights
<note place="marg">Strange sights s&eacute;ene.</note>
seene in Albion, as fighting of horssemen abroad in the fields, with great slaughter, as s&eacute;emed

morning suffred him to escape from amongst them againe. Moreouer, at Carrike there was a
child borne, perfect in all his lims sauing the head, which was like vnto a rauens. These

<head>CORBREID.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">AFTER</hi> Caratakes decease, his yoongest brother Corbreid was chosen to succeed in his place,
in the fiftie and eighth y&eacute;ere after Christ, for his elder brother was departed at Rome through
change of aire not agr&eacute;eable to his nature. This Corbreid was a stout man of stomach, much
resembling his brother Caratake. In the first beginning of his reigne, he did his indeuor to
purge his dominion of such as troubled the quiet state thereof, by robbing and spoiling the
husbandmen and other the meaner people of the countrie, of the which robbers there was no
small number in those daies, speciallie in the westerne Iles, also in Rosse &amp; Cathnes. In the
meane time the Picts hauing created there a new king called Conkist, gouernour of Mers and
Louthian, they set vpon the Romans being about to make fortresses in those parties. And

<note place="marg">Ostorius is wounded.</note>
perceiuing, speedilie came to relieue the same, but preasing too farre amongst his enimies, he
was sore wounded, and in great danger to haue b&eacute;ene slaine. The night comming vpon parted
the fraie, not without huge slaughter on both parts. After this, the warre continued still betwixt them with often incursions and skirmishes. At the length the Picts with such other

Britains as were come vnto them out of the Ile of Man and other parties, incountred with the Romans in battell, and vpon the first ioining, of purpose gaue backe, training some of the Romans

about, slue a great number of them, and chased the residue into the streicts of the mounteins,
where they were also surprised by such of the Picts as returned from the battell.</p>
<p>Ostorius vnderstanding how the matter went, withdrew with the rest of his people to his
campe, and shortlie after sent a purseuant vnto Rome, to informe the emperour in what state
things stood in Britaine, by reason of this rebellion of the Picts, who neither by force nor gentle persuasions could be pacified. The emperour determining to prouide remedie therefore,
sent word againe that he would not that the Picts should be eftsoons receiued vpon their submission, if they were driuen to make sute for pardon,but vtterlie to be destroied and exterminated.
For the accomplishment whereof he appointed two legions of such men of warre, as soiourned

<p>About the same time there arriued in Britaine an other Romane capteine to be generall in
place of Ostorius now deceassed, his name was Aulus Didius, with him came the two legions
<note place="marg">Aulus Didius commeth into Britaine.</note>
afore remembred. At his first comming ouer he mustered the old crewes of the Romane
souldiers first, much blaming them for their negligence, in suffering the enimies so to increase
vpon them, to the great danger of loosing all that (through sloth and faintnesse of courage)
which latelie before in Britaine had b&eacute;en woone and conquered by high prowes and valiant conduct of his predecessours. In the end he exhorted them to put away all feare, and fullie to
determine with themselues to recouer againe the honor which they had latelie lost, which he
said would easilie be brought to passe, if they would take vnto them manfull stomachs, and
obeie him and such other as had the gouernance and leading of them. The Picts being informed that this Aulus Didius was arriued with this new supplie of men, &amp; prepared to come
against them, they thought good to send vnto Corbreid king of Scotland, to require his aid
<note place="marg">The Picts sent to the Scots for aid.</note>
against the Romans, reputed as common enimies to all such as loued libertie, and hated to
liue in seruile bondage. For which respect Corbreid was the sooner moued to condescend
vnto the request of the Picts; and therevpon assembling an arme entred into Galloway. Wherof Aulus Didius being certified, sent an herald vnto him with all speed, commanding that he
should depart out of those quarters, sith he had no right there, considering that Galloway was
assigned vnto Caratake but for tearme of his owne life, by force of the emperours grant, and
now by the death of the same Caratake was reuersed againe vnto the empire.</p>
<p>The herald had vnneath doone his message, when word came vnto Corbreid how an armie
<note place="marg">Caesius Nasica entred with an armie into Galloway.</note>
of the Romans vnder the guiding of Caesius Nasica was entred into the marches of Galloway,
to the great terror of all the inhabitants, doubting to be spoiled and robbed on ech hand. These
newes put the herald in danger of his life, had not Corbreid vpon regard to the law of armes
licenced him to depart. The host which Corbreid brought with him into Galloway, he bestowed in castels and fortresses abroad in the countrie for more safegard, but he himselfe rode
in all hast vnto Epiake, to haue the aduise and aid of one Venusius that had maried the

forenamed Cartimandua that vnkind stepmother of Caratake, as ye haue heard before. This Venusius was of counsell with his wife Cartimandua in the betraieng of king Caratake, and therefore was growne into much hatred of the people for that fact, but through support of the Romans he was for a time defended from all their malices. Notwithstanding in the end being
<note place="marg">Venusius reuolteth.</note>
wearied of the proud gouernment of the Romans, he reuolted from them vnto Corbreid.
Wherewith his wife being offended, found means to apprehend both him and his brethren
with certeine of his kinsfolks, and laied them fast in prison.</p>
<p>But now Corbreied at his comming thither, did not onelie set them at libertie, but also tooke
<note place="marg">Cartimandua is buried quicke.</note>
&amp; caused Cartimandua to be buried quicke. In the meane while a certeine number of Scots
distressed a few forragers of the Romans, but following the chase somewhat rashlie, they were
inclosed by the enimies and slaine. This mischance put the Scots in great feare, and the Romans in good successe, so that Nasica was in purpose to haue assailed a certeine strong place,
wherein a number of the Scotishmen were gotten, and had fortified the entries, had not other
newes altered his purpose; for hearing how an other armie of the Scots was joined with the
Picts, and were approched within thr&eacute;e miles of him, he brought his host foorth into a plaine
where he ordered his battels readie to receiue them. Whereof the Scotishmen hauing knowledge, hasted foorth towards him, and were no sooner come in sight of the Romans, but that
with great violence they gaue the onset, most fierclie beginning the battell, which continued
till sun-setting with great slaughter on both sides; at what time the Romans were at the
point to haue discomfited their enimies, had not those Scotishmen which were left in fortresses
(as is said) abroad in the countrie, come at that selfe instant to the aid of their fellowes, by
whose means the battell was renewed againe, which lasted till the mirke night parted them
<note place="marg">The darke night parted the fraie.</note>

<p>Shortlie after a peace was concluded betwixt the parties, with these conditions; that the

held. And likewise the Picts paieng their former tribut for the finding of such garisons of
Romans as laie at Camelon, they should be no further charged with anie other exactions.
Moreouer it was agreed, that neither the Scots nor Picts from thenceforth should receiue or
succour anie rebels of Frenchmen or Britains, nor should aid by anie maner of means the inhabitants of the Ile of Man, who had doone manie notable displeasures to the Romans during
the last warres. This peace continued a six yeares during the life of Aulus Didius, who at the
<note place="marg">Aulus Didius departeth this life at London.</note>
end of those six yeares, departed this life at London, leauing behind him all things in good quiet.</p>
<p>After his deceasse the emperour Nero, who succeeded Claudius, appointed one Verannius
to be lieutenant of Britaine, a man verie ambitious and much desirous of honor, by means
<note place="marg">Verannius is made lieutenant of Britaine.</note>
whereof, in hope to aduance his name, he sought occasions to haue warres with the Scotishmen; and at length hearing that certeine of them being borderers had fetched booties out of
Pictland, he did send a great power of Romans to make a rode into the next marches of the
Scots, from whence they brought a great spoile, both of men and of goods. With which iniuries the Scots being moued, sought dailie in semblable sort to be reuenged, so that by such
means the warre was renewed. But before anie notable incounter chanced betwixt them,
Verannius died. His last words were full of ambitious boasts, wishing to haue liued but two
<note place="marg">Verannius departeth this life.</note>
yeares longer, that he might haue subdued the whole Ile of Albion vnto the Romane empire,
as if he might haue had so much time he doubted not to haue doone.</p>
<p>Paulinus Suetonius succ&eacute;eded in his place, a man of an excellent wit, and verie desirous of
<note place="marg">Paulinus Suetonius.</note>
peace. He first confirmed the ancient league with Corbreid king of Scotland: a recompense
being made in euerie behalfe for all wrongs &amp; iniuries doone on euerie part. After this (as
<note place="marg">Angleseie and not Man was thus inuaded by Suetonius.</note>
Hector Boetius hath gathered) he conquered the Ile of Man; but for somuch as by probable
reasons it is apparant inough, that it was not Man, but the Ile of Angleseie which the Britains
name M&ocirc;n, and at this time was subdued by Suetonius, we haue here omitted to make report
thereof, referring you to the place in the English chronicle, where we haue spoken sufficientlie
after what sort Suetonius both attempted &amp; atchiued this enterprise, which being brought to
end, he was sent for into Gallia, to represse certeine tumults raised among the people there.
In whose absence the Britains thinking to haue a meet time for their purpose, mooued a new
rebellion. But by the relation of Cornelius Tacitus, this chanced whilest Suetonius was busie
in requiring the Ile of Angleseie, as in the English chronicle it likewise appeareth, with the
strange sights and woonders which happened about the same time, wherevpon the southsaiers
(as Hector Boetius saith) declared that the Romans should receiue a great ouerthrow. Vpon
trust of whose words the Picts and other Britains inhabiting Camelon and in the marches
<note place="marg">The Scots and Picts kill the Romans.</note>

as then soiourned, who vnderstanding how the whole Ile was on ech side in an vprore, fled
ouer into France then called Gallia. This meane while qu&eacute;ene Voada sent vnto hir brother
Co breid king of Scotland, requiring his aid against the Romans, who had so vilie vsed hir and
hir daughters, to the great dishonor of hir and all hir linage, and now was the time to be reuenged of such iniuries, the whole nation of the Britains through the couetous dealing of the
procurator Catus, being risen in armes to recouer their ancient liberties.</p>
<p>Corbreid being highlie displeased towards the Romans for the euill intreating of his sister, determined either to s&eacute;e hir satisfied by woorthie recompense, or else to be reuenged on them that
had misvsed hir: and hereof gaue signification vnto Catus the procurator that was as then returned into Britaine with a power of men of warre. Corbreid receiuing but a scornefull answere from him, found meanes to ioine in league with Charanach king of the Picts, and

slaieng downe a woonderfull number of them. He also burned and destroied diuers townes,
such as in k&eacute;eping their alleigiance to the Romans stood earnestlie to their defense, as Berwike and Car&egrave;ill with others. About the same season there arriued in the frith a number of
Dutch ships, fraught with people of Merherne or Morauia, a region in Germanie situat 
<note place="marg">Dutchmen arriue in Scotland.</note>
betwixt Boheme and Hungarie. They were driuen out of their owne countrie by the Romans,
and assembling togither vnder a famous capteine named Roderike, came down to the mouth
of the Rhene, where making shift for vessels, they tooke the seas to s&eacute;eke them some new habitations; and thus arriuing in Pictland, were ioifullie receiued of the Picts and Scots, for that
they were reputed right valiant men, and glad to reuenge their owne iniuries against the Romans. Namelie with the Picts they were much est&eacute;emed, for that they came forth of the same
countrie from whence their ancestors were descended.</p>
<p>Their huge bodies and mightie lims did greatlie commend them in the sight of all men
<note place="marg">Merherns were men of goodlie stature.</note>
before whome they mustered, so that comming to the place where the kings of Scots and
Picts were incamped with their people readie to march foorth towards the enimies, they were
highlie welcomed, and vpon their offer receiued into companie, and appointed to go forth in
that iournie, in aid of qu&eacute;ene Voada against the Romans. With this Voada was assembled a
<note place="marg">Women come with the qu&eacute;ene in armour.</note>
mightie host of the Britains, amongest whom were fiue thousand women, wholie bent to reuenge the villanies doone to their persons by the Romans, or to die in the paine. And for
this purpose were they come well appointed with armour and weapons, to be the first that should
giue the onset. Voada hearing of hir brothers approch with the king of Picts and their armies,
met them on the waie accompanied with a great number of the nobles of Britaine, and brought
them to hir campe with great ioy and triumph.</p>
<p>After taking aduise how to behaue themselues in their enterprise, they thought it good to
make hast to fight with the procurator Catus, yer anie new power of men of warre might come
to his aid forth of Gallia now called France. Wherevpon marching towards him, they met
<note place="marg">The Romans are put to flight and ouerthrowne.</note>
togither in the field, where betwixt them was striken a right fierce and cruell battell; but
in the end the horssemen of the Romans part being put to flight, the footmen were beaten
downe on ech side; Catus himselfe being wounded, escaped verie hardlie by flight, and 
<note place="marg">Catus was wounded.</note>
shortlie after got him ouer into France. The Scots and Picts with other the Britains, hauing atchiued this victorie, pursued their enimies from place to place, so that there died by the sword,
what in the battell and elsewhere in the chase, seuentie thousand Romans and other strangers,
<note place="marg">70000 Romans slaine, and 30000 Britains.</note>
which serued amongest them; and of Scots, Picts, and other Britains, were slaine thirtie
thousand.</p>
<p>The gouernour Suetonius being then in Gallia, hearing of this ouerthrow, &amp; in what danger things stood in Britaine, by reason of the same, came ouer with two legions of souldiers,
and ten thousand of other Brigants as aiders to those legions. Voada the qu&eacute;ene 
<note place="marg">Voada assembled an armie against the Romans.</note>
vnderstanding of his arriuall, assembled againe hir people, and sent vnto the Scots and Picts to come to
hir aid: who togither with the Morauians came with all sp&eacute;ed vnto hir. When they were
thus assembled, Britains, Scots, Picts, &amp; Morauians on one part, and Romans with their aids
on the other, they marched forth to incounter togither with deliberat minds to trie the matter
by dint of sword, being earnestlie exhorted thereto by their gouernors on either side. So
that ioining puissance against puissance, they fought a right cruell battell, manie in the beginning
being slaine and borne downe on both sides. But in the end the victorie abode with the

The nobles and commons of the realme chose him to be their king, onelie for the good
opinion they had conceiued of him in his predecessors daies, by whome he was had in great
estimation, and had atchiued vnder him manie worthie enterprises, so that he was thought
most meetest for the roome, considering the sonnes of Corbreid were not as yet come vnto
ripe yeares to inioy the same. For the said Corbreid had three sons in all, Corbreid,

Tulcane, and Br&eacute;eke. The eldest had beene brought vp with Voada, qu&eacute;ene of the Britains,

of the common-wealth there. From thence he sailed vnto the Iles of Lewis and Skie,
<note place="marg">Gald punisheth such as disturbe the quiet state of his subiects.</note>
and put to death certeine offendors that would not be obedient vnto their gouernors and
iudges. After this he returned by Rosse, and set a stay also in that countrie, touching certeine misdemeanors of the people there. To be short, h&eacute;e purged the whole realme of all
such robbers, th&eacute;eues, and other the like offendors against the quiet peace of his subiects, as
were hugelie increased by the licentious rule of his predecessor Dardan, and herevnto he
was mightilie aided by the Morauians, who pursued such offendors most earnestlie, and
<note place="marg">The Morauians helpe to apprehend th&eacute;eues and offendors.</note>
brought in vnto him no small number of them, euer as they caught them.</p>
<p>By this meanes was the state of the common-wealth brought into better quiet, and the
yeere next insuing, being the third of Gald his reigne, he called a councell at Dunstafage,
wherein he laboured much for the abrogating of the wicked lawes instituted by king Ewin,
<note place="marg">Gald laboreth to abrogate wicked lawes.</note>
as before is partlie specified: but he could not obteine more, than that poore men from
thencefoorth should haue their wiues fr&eacute;e vnto themselues, without being abused from time
to time indifferentlie by their landlords, as heretofore they had bene. Whilest he was thus
busied about the establishing of holsome orders &amp; statuts for the welth of his subiects, woord
was brought him that Petilius Cerealis a Roman capteine, being sent from Vespasian the
<note place="marg">Petilius Cerealis a Romane capteine sent by Vespasian into Britaine.</note>
emperour to haue the gouernement of Britaine, was landed with a puissant armie in the

<p>With these newes Gald being somewhat astonished, thought good to vnderstand the

certeintie of the enimies dooings, before he made anie sturre for the leuieng of his people, and
therefore appointed certeine light horssemen to ride foorth, and to bring certeine newes of
that which they might heare or see: who at their returne declared that the enimies armie

great ouerthrow; and further, how they were turned westward on the left hand, in purpose to
enter into Galloway. Gald being thus certified of the Romans approch towards his countrie,
determined to giue them battell, before they entered into the inner parts of his realme, and
therefore with all sp&eacute;ed he assembled his people, to the number of fiftie thousand men, all
such as were able to beare armor, being readie to repaire vnto him in such present necessitie
for defense of their countrie.</p>
<p>It hath b&eacute;ene reported, that as he marched foorth towards his enimies, sundrie strange
sights appeared by the way. An eagle was seene almost all a whole day, flieng vp and downe
ouer the Scotish armie, euen as though she had laboured hir selfe wearie. Also an armed
man was seene flieng round about the armie, and suddenlie vanished away. There fell in
like maner out of a darke cloud in the fields, through the which the armie should passe,
diuerse kinds of birds that were spotted with bloud. These monstruous sights troubled mens
minds diuerslie, some construing the same to signifie good successe, and some otherwise.
Also the chiefest capteins amongst the Scots were not all of one opinion, for some of them
<note place="marg">The Scots not all of one mind.</note>
weieng the great force of the Romane armie, being the greatest that euer had b&eacute;ene brought
into their countrie before that day, counselled that they shuld in no wise be fought withall,
but rather to suffer them to wearie themselues, till vittels and other prouision should faile
them, and then to take the aduantage of them, as occasion serued.</p>
<p>Other were of a contrarie mind, iudging it best (sith the puissance of the whole realme
was assembled) to giue battell, least by deferring time, the courage and great desire, which
the people had to fight, should wax faint and decaie: so that all things considered, it was
generallie in the end agr&eacute;ed vpon to giue battell, and so comming within sight of the enimies
<note place="marg">The Scots agr&eacute;e to fight with the Romans.</note>
host, they made readie to incounter them. At the first the Scots were somewhat amazed
with the great multitude of their aduersaries, but through the ch&eacute;erefull exhortations of their
king, and other their capteins, their stomachs began to reuiue, so that they boldlie set vpon
the Romans, whereof insued betwixt them a right fierce and cruell battell, howbeit in the

end the victorie inclined to the Romans, and the Scots were chased out of the field. Gald
<note place="marg">The Scots are discomfited.</note>
himselfe was wounded in the face, yet escaped he out of the battell, but not without great
danger in d&eacute;ed, by reason the Romans pursued most egerlie in the chase.</p>
<p>There were slaine of the Scotishmen (as their chronicles report) aboue twelue thousand,
and of the Romans about six thousand. This victorie being thus atchiued, the Romans got
<note place="marg">The citie called Epiake is woon by the Romans.</note>
possession of Epiake with the greatest part of all Galloway, and passed the residue of that
y&eacute;ere without anie other notable exploit: but in the summer following, Petilius the Romane
gouernor went about to subdue the rest of the countrie, the Scots oftentimes making diuerse
skirmishes with him, but in no wise durst ioine with them, puissance against puissance, least
<note place="marg">The Scots durst not fight any field with the Romans.</note>
they should haue put their countrie into further danger, if they had chanced eftsoones to
haue receiued the ouerthrow.</p>
<p>&para; Here haue we thought good to aduertise the reader, that although the Scotish writers
impute all the trauels, which Petilius spent in subduing the Brigants, and Frontinus in conquering the Silures, to be imploied chieflie against Scots &amp; Picts : the opinion of the best
learned is wholie contrarie therevnto, affirming the same Brigants &amp; Silures not to be so far

them, which thing in the historie of England we haue also noted, where ye may read more
of all the dooings of the Romans here in Britaine, as in their writers we find the same
recorded. But neuerthelesse wee haue here followed the course of the Scotish historie,
in maner as it is written by the Scots themselues, not binding anie man more in this place
than in other to credit them further than by conference of authors it shall seeme to them
expedient.</p>
<p>In the meane time then, whilest Petilius was occupied (as before ye haue hard) in the
conquest of Galloway, Voadicia the daughter of Aruiragus (whom the Romans had before
<note place="marg">Voadicia reneweth wars with the Romans.</note>
time misused, as before in this treatise is partlie touched) gathered togither a crew of souldiors
within the Ile of Man, partlie of the inhabitants, and partlie of such Scotishmen of Galloway
as were fled thither for succor: with these sh&eacute;e tooke the seas, and landing in Galloway,
vpon purpose to reuenge hir iniuries in times past receiued at the Romans hands, she set
<note place="marg">The Romane campe assailed in the night by Voadicia.</note>
vpon their tents in the night season, when they looked for nothing lesse than to be disquieted, by reason whereof they were brought into such disorder, that if Petilius had not
caused such fierbrands to be kindled as he had prepared and dressed with pitch, rosen and
tallow, for the like purpose, the whole campe had beene in great danger: but these torches
or firebrands gaue not onlie light to s&eacute;e where to make resistance, but also being cast in
the faces of the enimies, staied their hardie forwardnesse, whereby the Romans hauing
leasure to place themselues in arraie, defended the entries of their campe, till the day was
sproong, and then giuing a full onset vpon their enimies, they put them quite to flight.</p>
<p>But Voadicia not herewith discouraged, hasted with all speed vnto Epiake, and taking
<note place="marg">Epiake is taken &amp; burned by Voadicia.</note>
that citie she set fire on it, and slue such Romans as she found there, where of Petilius being
certified, sent foorth a legion against hir to withstand hir attempts. Those that had the
charge of them that were thus sent, vsed such diligence, that laieng an ambush for hir in a
place fit for that purpose, they so inclosed hir, that slaieng the most part of hir company,
she was taken prisoner hir selfe, and being brought aliue vnto Petilius, vpon hir stout answer
made vnto him, as he questioned with hir about hir bold enterprises, sh&eacute;e was presentlie

and so remaining there till the next yeere after, he fell sicke of the flix and died. Immediatlie
wherevpon the emperour sent one Iulius Frontinus to succ&eacute;ed in his place. This Frontinus

had left there for the keeping of that quarter, he commended their loialtie and diligence,
in that they had looked so well to their charge, that the enimie had gained no aduantage at
their hands, whilest the armie was occupied in the south parts about other affaires there.
He also sent an herald vnto the king of the Picts with letters, requiring him to renew by confirmation the former league betwixt his people &amp; the Romans, &amp; not by any means to aid
the Scots as before they had done to their great losse &amp; hindrance. Hervnto the king of
Picts much suspecting the matter, made a direct answer, that he saw no cause why he should
in fauor of the Romans suffer his confederats the Scots to be subdued, and brought to destruction without all reason or equitie: and therefore he was determined by the aduise of
his p&eacute;eres &amp; councellors, to aid the Scots against such as sought nothing but the meanes how
to bring the whole Ile of Albion into thraldome and seruile bondage.</p>
<p>Frontinus little regarding this vntowardlie answer, set forward to subdue such Scots as
were yet disobedient. And so entring into the borders of Kile, Carrike, and Coningham,

had diuers skirmishes with such as king Gald had assembled to defend his countrie, but

selfe into Argile, leauing his power behind him to resist the enimies attempts: but shortlie
after his departure from amongst them, they were fought withall by the Romans, and discomfited, thr&eacute;e thousand of them being slaine in the field. By reason of which ouerthrowe
those countries submitted themselues to the Romans, perceiuing no hope otherwise how to

armie was licenced to withdraw to their lodgings for the winter season, during the which,

<note place="marg">Karanach K. of the Picts discomfited by the Romans.</note>
Frontinus fell sicke of superfluous abundance of flegme, which vexed him in such sort, that
the emperor Domitian, who as then gouerned the Romane empire, sent for him home to
Rome, and appointed a right valiant personage, one lulius Agricola to succ&eacute;ed as lieutenant
of Britaine in his roome. About the time of whose arriuall there, the Scots of Annandale
slue a great number of the Romans, with which successe they procured also the Picts with
the inhabitants of Galloway, Kile, Carrike, and Coningham to rebell.</p>
<p>These newes being reported vnto Agricola, he made his prouision with all sp&eacute;ed to go
against them, and first entring into the borders of Pictland, he reduced such as inhabited
about the confines of Berwike to their former subiection, and after marching towards the
citie of Camelon, Karanach king of the Picts incountred him by the waie, but being fiercelie
beaten off by the Romans, he fled backe into the citie, and within three daies after hauing reinforced his power, he eftsoones gaue battell againe to his enimies; but then also being vanquished, he lost the most part of all his men, and so immediatlie therevpon was Camelon
woone by force, &amp; a great number of the citizens slaine.</p>
<p>Agricola caused it to be newlie fortified, and further through fame of this victorious beginning, he recouered the most part of all the castels and fortresses of Pictland. The forenamed Karanach escaping out of that present danger, got him beyond the water of Firth,
<note place="marg">Karanach flieth beyond the Firth.</note>
for the more suertie of his owne person. Agricola hauing sped thus in Pictland, marched
foorth against them of Annandale, who at the first m&agrave;king resistance for a time, at length
were constreined to giue backe, and so fled to their houses, where in the night following by
their owne wiues they were murthered each mothers sonne: for so the women of that nation
<note place="marg">The Scots of Annandale slaine by their wiues.</note>
vsed to put awaie the shame of their husbands, when they at any time had fled out of the
field from their enimies.</p>
<p>Agricola vnderstanding that by winning him fame in the beginning, it should be no small
furtherance vnto him for the atchiuing of other enterprises in time to come, determined to
<note place="marg">Here is a manifest error in the Scotish writers, taking Man for Anglesey.</note>
pursue his good fortune, and therevpon prepared to subdue the Ile of Man; but wanting
vessels to conuey his armie ouer, he found meanes that such as could swim, and knew the

shallow places of that coast, made shift to passe the goolfe, and so got on land, to the great
<note place="marg">Agricola assaileth the Ile of Anglesey and not Man as <emph>Hector Boetius</emph> mistaketh it.</note>
woonder and amazing of the inhabirants, who watched the sea coasts, to resist such ships as
they looked for to haue arriued vpon their shore: but now despairing to resist such kind of
warriors as indangered themselues to passe the seas in that maner of wise, they submitted
themselues vnto Agricola.</p>
<p>Who taking pledges of them, and appointing certeine garoons to k&eacute;epe diuers holds and
<note place="marg">The Ile of Anglesey is subdued by Agricola.</note>
places of defense within that Ile, passed ouer with the residue of his people into Galloway,
where he soiourned all the winter following: which being passed, and summer once come,
he assembled his men of warre againe, and visited a great part of that countrie with Kile,
Carrike, and Coningham, the inhabitants whereof he put in such feare with the onelie shew
of his warlike armie, disposed in such politike order and wise conduct, that there was none
to be found that durst aduance themselues to incounter him, so that he spent that summers
season in k&eacute;eping such of the Scots as had beene aforetime subdued, from attempting any
commotion. And when winter was come, he assembled the nobles of the countrie, 
<note place="marg">Agricola studieth to bring the Scots vnto ciuilitie.</note>
exhorting them by gentle persuasions, to frame themselues to a ciuill trade of liuing, as well
in building of temples, houses, and other edifices after the Roman maner, as also in wearing
of comelie and decent apparell; and aboue all things to set their children to schoole, to
be brought vp in eloquence and good nurture. By this meanes he thought to traine them
from their accustomed fiercenesse, and to win them the sooner to be content with bondage,
though he coloured it with neuer so faire a glose of humanitie.</p>
<p>The third winter being thus spent, and the next summer commen vpon, Agricola inuaded
such countries as were yet vndiscouered by the Romans, entring by the nether side of
Calidon wood, euen vnto the dolorous mounteine, which afterwards by the Scots was cleped
<note place="marg">Kalendar wood Agricola commeth to Sterling.</note>
Sterling. It was called the dolorous mounteine, for that in the night season there was heard
right lamentable noise &amp; cries, as though the same had b&eacute;ene of some creatures that had
bewailed their miserable cases: which vndoubtedlie was the craftie illusions of wicked spirits,
to k&eacute;epe mens minds still oppressed in blind errors and superstitious fantasies.</p>
<p>Agricola considering the naturall strength of this mounteine, with the site of an old
ruinous castell that stood thereon, he caused the same with all diligence to be repared, and
<note place="marg">Agricola buildeth the castle of Sterling with the bridge.</note>
a bridge to be made ouer the Forth there, by the which he passed with his whole armie
ouer into Fife: and the daie after, hearing that the king of the Picts was withdrawne into a
castell thereby, standing vpon an high mounteine cleped Beenart, he inuironed the same
<note place="marg">Mount B&eacute;enart.</note>
with a strong siege, howbeit his hoped prey was not as then within it, for Karanach king of
the Picts, informed of the Romans approch, got him foorth abroad into the fields, and assembling his power, purposed by night to haue broken the bridge, which Agricola had
<note place="marg">Karanach assaileth Sterling bridge, which the Romans defended.</note>
made ouer the Forth at Sterling, but being repelled by such as were set there to defend the
same, in his returne from thence he was incountred by Agricola himselfe, who being certified
of this attempt of his enimies, had leuied his siege, and was comming towards them, so that
both the hosts m&eacute;eting togither in the fields, there was fought a sore battell betwixt them,
though in the end the Picts were discomfited, and their king the foresaid Karanach chased
<note place="marg">Karanach is eftsoones chased.</note>

<note place="marg">Fife with other countries brought into subiection of the Romans.</note>
vnto the riuer of Tay, where he got a bote, and escaped to the further side of that water.
By reason of this ouerthrow, Agricola brought in subiection those countries, which lie betw&eacute;ene the waters of Forth and Tay, as Fife, Fothrike, and Ernedall, and soiourning there
all the winter following, he built sundrie fortresses in places most conuenient for the k&eacute;eping
of the inhabitants in their couenanted obedience, after his departure from amongst them.</p>
<p>In the meane while, the king of the Picts kept him at Dund&eacute;e, whither resorted vnto him
a great number of the Pictish nobilitie, such as had escaped the Romans hands. These
<note place="marg">Karanach comforted by his nobles.</note>
comforted their king in all that they might, willing him to be of good ch&eacute;ere, and to hope
well of the recouerie of his losses againe by some good fortune and meanes that might

as well for counsell as aid of hand : and herevpon they tooke aduise which waie to worke,

the hands of their ancient confederats the Scots, and so incontinentlie there were certeine
messingers dispatched with all speed vnto Gald the Scotish king, requiring him in that 
<note place="marg">The Picts send for aid to king Gald.</note>
common ieopardie to ioine. in league with his ancient friends the Picts, against the ambitious
and most cruell Romans, who sought nothing else but the vtter subuersion of the whole
land of Albion, as manifestlie app&eacute;ered by their proc&eacute;edings, hauing alreadie occupied and
wrongfullie surprised a great part not onlie of the Pictish kingdome, but also of the Scotish
dominions, minding still to go forward in such vnrighteous conquests, if by timelie resistance
they were not staied. Gald vpon this request and motion of the Picts gladlie consented to
<note place="marg">Gald premiseth to ioine in league with the Picts against the Romans.</note>
ioine his power with theirs, in common defense of both the realmes (against such common
enimies as the Romans were esteemed) hauing herevnto the assent of all his p&eacute;eres and
ch&eacute;efest councellors.</p>
<p>Thus whilest the kings of the Scots and Picts were concluding a league togither for defense of themselues and their countries, certeine Scots entred into the confines of Kile,
Carrike, and Coningham, and wan diuers fortresses, wherein certeine garrisons of Romane
souldiers soiourned, whome they slue downe right without all mercie, spoiling the whole

<note place="marg">The riuer of Clide, otherwise called Clude.</note>

<note place="marg">Agricola repelling the Scots, could not yet win the castell of Dunbreton, ancientlie called Awldcluch, or Alcluth.</note>
countrie. Agricola hauing knowledge hereof, went streightwaies thither with a power, and
pursuing them that had doone those iniuries, some he tooke amongst the hilles and mounteines, whither they fled; and the residue he chased beyond the riuer of Clide, but the castell
of Dunbreton he could not by any meanes obteine, though he assaied to win it euen to the
vttermost of his power. It was called in those daies Alcluth, that is to meane: All stone.
The Scotishmen being thus driuen backe, Agricola repared such castels and fortresses as they
had ouerthrowne and beaten downe.</p>
<p>In the yeare following, being the fift after the first comming of Agricola into Britaine, he
caused his ships to be brought about fr&omacr; the Ile of Wight into the water of Lochfine in
Argile, thereby to put his enimies in vtter despaire of escaping his hands either by water or
land: and therevpon passing ouer the riuer of Clide with his armie, and finding his nauie
there, he set vpon the countrie of Lennox, in purpose to subdue the same. But after he
<note place="marg">Agricola inuadeth Lennox.</note>
had made sundrie skirmishes with the inhabitants, he was certified by letters from the gouernor of Camelon, that the Picts were readie to rebell, by reason wherof he left off this
enterprise against the Scots, and drew backe into Pictland, leauing a part of his armie to
<note place="marg">Agricola returneth into Pictland, to appease a rebellion of the people there.</note>

<note place="marg">He returneth vnto Clide.</note>
keepe possession of the water of Clide, till his returne againe into those parties. At his
comming into Pictland, he appesed the rebels with small adoo, punishing the ch&eacute;efe authors
according to their demerits. This doone, he returned vnto the water of Clide, lieng all that
winter beyond the same, taking order for the gouernment of those parties, in due obedience
of the Romane empire.</p>
<p>The summer following he appointed his nauie to search alongst by the coast all the hauens
<note place="marg">Agricola pursueth his enterprise against the Scots.</note>
and cr&eacute;eks of Argile, and of the Ilands n&eacute;ere to the same. Whilest he by land passing ouer
the water of Leuine, went about to conquer townes and castels, though halfe discouraged
at the first, by reason of the rough waies, streict passages, high mounteines, craggie rocks,
thicke woods, d&eacute;epe marishes, fens and mosses, with the great riuers which with his armie
he must n&eacute;eds passe, if he minded to atteine his purpose: but the old souldiers being inured
with paines and trauell, ouercame all these difficulties by the wise conduct of their woorthie
generall and other the capteins, and so inuading the countrie tooke townes and castels, of
the which some they beat downe and raced, and some they fortified and stuffed with garisons of men of warre.</p>
<p>About the same time by commandement of king Gald, and other the gouernors of 
<note place="marg">At the Scots assemble.</note>
Scotland, all the able men of Cantire, Lorne, Murrey land, Lugemarth, also those of the westerne
Iles, &amp; of all other parties belonging to the Scotish dominions, were appointed to assemble
and come togither in Atholl, at a place not passing fiue miles distant from the castell of
Calidon now cleped Dunkeld, there to abide the comming of Karanach king of the Picts,
to the end that ioining togither in one armie, they might some high exploit. But he hauing
assembled fift&eacute;ene thousand of his men of war, as he marched alongst by the mounteine of

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"Granzbene,"</fw>-->

<pb n="79"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"79"</fw>-->

Granzbene, in times past cleped Mons Grampius, there chanced a mutinie amongest his
people, so that falling togither by the eares, Karanach himselfe comming amongst them 
<note place="marg">Karanach K. of the Picts slaine by misfortune of one of his owne subiects.</note>
vnarmed as he was to part the fraie, was slaine presentlie at vnwares, by one that knew not
what he was. By reason of which mischance that iournie was broken, for the Picts being
vtterlie amazed and discomfited h&eacute;erewith, skaled and departed asunder.</p>
<p>Gald with his Scots now being thus disappointed of the Picts his ch&eacute;efest aid, durst not
ieopard to trie the chance of battell with the enimies, but determined with light skirmishes,
and by withdrawing of vittels out of their walke, to stop them from further proceeding in
conquest of the countrie, &amp; in the mean time to prouide against the next summer new aid
and succors to k&eacute;epe the field, and so to incounter with them, puissance against puissance,
if they remained so long in the countrie. The Scots resting vpon this resolution, thought
good to send some honorable ambassage vnto the Picts to mooue them vnto mutuall 
<note place="marg">An ambassage fr&omacr; the Scots to the Picts.</note>
agr&eacute;ement &amp; concord amongst themselues, whereby they might be able to resist the common
ruine of their countrie as then in present danger to be oppressed by the Romans.</p>
<p>Those that were sent on this message, did so diligentlie behaue themselues, in bringing
<note place="marg">The Picts brought to agr&eacute;ement amongst themselues.</note>
their purpose to passe, that the Picts in the end agr&eacute;ed to ioine in friendlie amitie one with
another, and to choose one Garnard to their king to succ&eacute;ed in the roome of Karanach.
They also confirmed the former leage with the Scots, and by their procurement sent messengers
vnto the Nowwegians and Danes, requiring them of aid against the Romans the common
enimies of all such nations as loued to lue in libertie, wheresoeuer the same were inhabiting
in anie part on the whole face of the earth. There were also sent ambassadors vnto the
<note place="marg">Ambassadors sent vnto the Danes and Irishmen for aid.</note>
Irishmen from the Scots for the same intent, and from both those places there was great aid
promised, as fr&omacr; them that est&eacute;emed themselues halfe bound by a naturall respect, to succor
such as were descended of the same ancestors and countries that they were of, and now like
to be expelled out of the seats which their forefathers had got possession in by iust title
of conquest, and left the same into their posteritie to enioy for euer.</p>
<p>Whilest these things were thus in dooing, Galdus diuiding his armie into sundrie parts,
did what was possible to resist all the attempts of the Romans. Who standing in doubt of
<note place="marg">The fame of Gald his puissance putteth the Romans in feare.</note>
his puissance, rather through fame thereof, than for anie apparant sight or other knowledge
had, durst not put themselues in danger to enter into Calidon wood, of all that summer;
and thewinter following was so extreame, by reason of frost, snow, and coldnesse of aire,
that they were not able to enterprise anie exploit on neither part: howbeit the summer was
no sooner come (being the seauenth after the comming of Agricola into Britaine) but that
they prepared to inuade one an other againe with all their forces.</p>
<p>Foorth of Ireland there came (according as was promised) a great power of men of warre,
<note place="marg">An aid of Irishmen come to the succors of the Scots.</note>
and ioined with an armie of Scotishmen in Atholl, being there alreadie assembled in great
numbers out of all quarters of the Scotish dominions. Thither came also Garnard king of
the Picts with his power. All which forces being thus assembled togither by common
agr&eacute;ement amongest them, Gald king of the Scots was chosen to be their generall, who
<note place="marg">Gald chosen to be generall against the Romans.</note>
hearing that Agricola with his host was entred into Kalendar wood, diuided the whole armie
into three battels, and so marched foorth towards the enimies in purpose to incounter them.
Agricola being of this aduertised by spials, parted his people also into thr&eacute;e wards, doubting
to be inclosed within some combersome place by reason of the great multitude of his enimies,
that were est&eacute;emed to be in number aboue 50000 of one and other.</p>
<p>Gald on the other side vnderstanding by spials this order of the Romans, in the dead of
the night setteth vpon one of those legions, which was lodged next vnto him, and finding
meanes to slea the watch, was entred into the enimies lodgings, before they had anie

knowlege of his comming, so that the fight was right fierce &amp; cruell euen among the Romans
tents and lodgings. But Agricola being certified of this enterprise of the Scots, sent foorth
with all sp&eacute;ed a certeine number of light horssemen and footmen to assaile them on the
backs, &amp; so to k&eacute;epe them occupied, till he might come with all the residue of his people
to the rescue. They that were thus sent, accomplishing their enterprise according to the

deuise in that behalfe appointed, gaue a right fierce &amp; stout charge vpon the Scots and Picts,
greatlie to the reliefe of those that were by them assailed, and withall sore amazed and disordered by reason of the enimies sudden inuasioh.</p>
<p>By this meanes the fight continued right fierce and cruell on all sides, till at length the daie
<note place="marg">Agricola ommeth to the succors of his men.</note>

<note place="marg">Agricola discomfiteth his enimies.</note>
beginning to app&eacute;ere, shewed to the Scots and Picts the plaine view of the whole Romane armie, approching vnder the conduct of Agricola, to the succour of his people, being thus in
danger to be distressed. Heerewith were the Scots and Picts put in such feare, that immediatlie they fell to running awaie towards the woods and bogs, the accustomed places of their
refuge. This ouerthrow did so abash both the Scots and Picts, that they durst attempt no
more the fortune of battell, till they had some aid out of Denmarke, but onelie did what they
could to defend their townes and countrie, by making sundrie raises vpon their enimies, as occasion and opportunitie serued. But the Romans, supposing nothing to be hard for their vndaunted valiancie, but that they were able to ouercome whatsoeuer should stand at defiance
against them, determined at length to find an end of the Ile of Albion, and so passing thorough
<note place="marg">The Romans passe through Calidon wood ouer the riuer of Amond.</note>
Kalendar wood, and ouer the riuer of Amond, they pitched their field n&eacute;ere to the riuer of
Taie, not far from the castell named Calidon or Kalendar.</p>
<p>The Picts, by reason that their enimies were lodged so neere to the confines of their countrie
doubting what might follow thereof, burned the citie of Tuline, least the same enimies chancing
<note place="marg">The Picts burne the citie of Tuline.</note>

<note place="marg">The place where Tuline stood is called by the inhabitants at this daie Inchtuthill.</note>
to take it, should furnish it with some garrison of men, to the great danger of the whole Pictish kingdome. This citie stood vpon the banke of Taie, right beautifullie built, with many
faire castels and towers, as may appeere euen vnto this daie by the old ruines therof, strong rather by the workemans hands, than by nature. The Scotishmen in our time call the place
Inchtuthill. All their wiues and children they remooued vnto the mounteins of Granzbene
for their more suertie and safegard.</p>
<p>About the same time the Romans were not a little disquieted, by reason of a mutinie which
<note place="marg">The Germans c&omacr;ming to serue the Romans rebell against their captein and leaders.</note>
chanced amongst such Germans as were appointed to come ouer to Agricola, as a new supplie to furnish vp such numbers as were decaied in his armic. These slaieng their capteine,
and such other Romans as were appointed to haue the order of them for their training in warlike feats at the beginning, as the maner was, got certeine pinnesses which they happened vpon
in the riuer of Thames, and sailing about the east and north coasts of this Ile, arriued in Taie
water, offering themselues to the Scots and Picts to serue against the Romans, whose malice
they dread for their offense committed if they should returne into their owne countries, which

<p>Their offer was accepted most thankefullie, and places appointed for them to inhabit
amongest the Murraies, because they were descended as it were of one nation. Whilest these
things were thus a dooing, there came also the long wished aid from the Danes and Norwegians, to the number of ten thousand men, vnder the leading of one Gildo. This Gildo with
his nauie first arriued in the frith betwixt Fife and Louthian, but for that the Romans kept
him off from landing there, he cast about and came into the riuer of Taie, where he landed all
his people, for prouision wherof he had good store both of vittels and armour. Garnard
king of the Picts hearing of their arriuall there, foorthwith vpon the newes departed from Dund&eacute;e, accompanied with a great number of his nobles, and comming to the place where Gildo
with his armie was lodged, receiued him in most ioifull wise, feasted and banketed him and
his people, and shewed them all the tokens of most hartie loue and friendship that could be deuised. Gildo himselfe was led by the king vnto Dundee, and lodged with him there in the
castell, his people were prouided for abroad in the countrie in places most for their ease, to refresh themselues the better after their painefull iournie by the seas.</p>
<p>Shortlie after there came vnto Dund&eacute;e the Scotish king Gald, who for his part did
all the honour that in him lay vnto Gildo, shewing himselfe most ioifull and glad of his
comming, y&eacute;elding vnto him and his people such thanks and congratulations as serued best

to the purpose, and receiued no lesse at his and their hands againe. After they had remained thus certeine daies togither at Dund&eacute;e, both the kings Gald &amp; Garnard, togither with
this Gildo, went vnto the castell of Forfare, there to consult with their capteins and gouernours
of their men of warre, how to mainteine themselues in their enterprise against the enimie. At
length they resolued not to go foorth into the field till the winter season were past, for doubt
of the inconuenience that might insue, by reason of the extreame cold intemperancie of the
aire, whereto that countrie is greatlie subiect.</p>
<p>In the meane time they tooke order for the furniture of all things necessarie for the wars,
to haue the same in a perfect readines against the next spring, and till then they did appoint
onelie to k&eacute;epe fronter warre, that the Romans should not straie abroad to fetch in vittels and
other prouisions to their owne gains, and to the vndooing of the poore inhabitants. Vpon this
determination when the councell was broken vp, Gald withdrew into Atholl, to defend those
parties; and Garnard with the Danish generall Gildo, furnished all the castels and holds in
Angus ouer against the riuer of Taie, to stop the passages of the same, that the enimies should
enter no further on that side. Thus passed the winter for that yeare, without anie great exploit on either part atchiued.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the next summer, Agricola appointed his nauie of ships to saile about
<note place="marg">Agricola sendeth forth his nauie of ships, to discouer the furthest point of Britaine northward.</note>
the coasts of the furthest parts of Albion, making diligent search of euerie cr&eacute;eke &amp; hauen
alongst by the same. The mariners executing his commandement, sailed round about the
north coast, discouering manie of the westerne Iles, and likewise those of Orkneie, till at
length they found out Pictland firth, being a streict of the sea of twentie miles in bredth, which
separateth the Iles of Orkneie from the point of Cathnesse, passing with so swift a course,
that without an expert pilot the ships that shall passe the same are oftentimes in great danger, by reason of the contrarie course of the tides. The Romane mariners therefore, finding
certeine husbandmen in the next Iles, constreined them to go a shipbord, &amp; to guide them
through that streict, promising them high rewards for their labour; but they vpon a malicious
intent not passing for their owne Iiues, so they might be reuenged of their enimies in casting away
<note place="marg">The Romane ships through want of pilots are lost in Pictland frith.</note>
such a notable number of them togither with their vessels, entred the streict at such an inconuenient time, that the ships were borne with violence of the streame against the rocks and
shelues, in such wise that a number of the same were drowned and lost without recouerie.</p>
<p>Some of them that were not ouer-hastie to follow the first, s&eacute;eing the present losse of their

fellows, returned by the same way they came vnto Agricola, who in this meane time had
caused a bridge to be made ouer the riuer of Tay, by the which he passed with his whole armie, and incamped on the further side thereof n&eacute;ere to the roots of the mounteine of Granzbene, leauing the bridge garnished with a competent number of souldiers to defend it against
the enimies. The Picts being not a little troubled herewith, dispatched forth a messenger with
all hast vnto Gald the Scotish king, signifieng vnto him the whole matter, and thervpon required of him aid.</p>
<p>Gald hauing mustered his people aswell Scotish as Irish, assembled them togither to the

driuen to the vttermost bounds of their countrie, he persuaded them to make vertue of necessitie, and rather choose to die with honor, than to liue in perpetuall shame &amp; ignominie, which
must n&eacute;eds insue to their whole nation, if they suffered themselues to be vanquished in that

the hearts of his people, that they desired nothing but to ioine with their enimies, &amp; to
trie it by dint of sword, which they vniuersallie signified according to their accustomed vse
with a great noise, shout, and clamor.</p>
<p>On the other part Agricola, though he perceiued a great desire amongest his souldiers to
fight, yet he was not negligent on his owne behalfe to incourage them with most ch&eacute;erefull words
and countenance; so that both the armies being thus bent to haue battell, the generals on
both parties began to set them in araie. Agricola to the end his armie being the lesser number should not be assailed both a front and on the sides, prouided (by disposing them in a certeine order) a remedie against that disaduantage. On the other side, king Gald by reason of

<note place="marg">The armies approch togither to fight.</note>

<note place="marg">They ioine.</note>
the aduantage which he had in his great multitude and number, ordered his battels thereafter
with a long and large front, placing the same vpon the higher ground, of purpose to compasse
in the enimies on ech side. At the first approch of the one armie towards the other, the battell was begun right fiercelie with shot of arrows and hurling of darts, which being once past,
they ioined togither to trie the matter by hand-strokes, wherein the Scots &amp; Picts had one
disaduantage, for those that were archers, or (as I may call them) kerns, comming once to
fight at hand-blowes, had nothing but broad swords and certeine sorie light bucklers to

than to be carried foorth into the warres, though the same haue b&eacute;ene so vsed among the
Scotishmen, euen till these our daies.</p>
<p>The Romans therefore being well appointed with armor and broad targets, slue downe right
a great number of these Scots and Picts thus slenderlie furnished, without receiuing anie great
damage againe at their hands, till king Gald appointed his spearemen to step forth before those
archers &amp; kerns, to succor them, and therewith also the bilmen came forward, and stroke on
so freshlie, that the Romans were beaten downe on heaps, in such wise that they were n&eacute;ere
at point to haue bene discomfited, had not a band of Germans (which serued amongst the
<note place="marg">A cohort of Germans restored the Romane side n&eacute;ere at point to haue had the worse.</note>
Romans) rushed foorth with great violence vpon the Scotishmen, where most danger appeared,
and so restored againe the fainting stomachs of the Romans, whereby the battell renewed on
both sides againe right fierce and cruell, that great ruth it was to behold that bloudie fight
and most vnmercifull murther betwixt them, which continued with more violence on the Scotish side than anie warlike skill, till finallie the night comming on, tooke the daies light from

and Picts with their confederats the Danes, Norwegians, and Irishmen, such as were left aliue,
got them into the next mounteins, hauing lost in this cruell conflict the most part of their whole
numbers.</p>
<p>&para; Cornelius Tacitus agr&eacute;eth not in all points with the Scotish chronicles, in a booke which
he wrote of the life of Iulius Agricola, where he intreateth of this battell. For he speaketh
but of thirtie thousand men (which he comprehendeth vnder the generall name of Britains)

<note place="marg">The number of them that were slaine at this battell.</note>
to be assembled at that time against the Romans, making no mention of anie Scots, Picts,
Irishmen, Norwegians, or Danes, that should be there in their aid. The number of them that
were slaine on the Britains side (as the same Tacitus recounteth) amounted to about ten thousand men, and of the Romans not passing three hundred and fortie. Amongst whom was
one Aulus Atticus, a capteine of one of the cohorts. But as the Scotish writers affirme, there
died that day of Scots, Picts, and other their confederates at the point of twentie thousand, and
of the Romans and such as serued on their side, as good as twelue thousand. Moreouer,
the night following, when Galdus with the residue of his people which were left aliue was
withdrawne to the mounteins, and that the huge losse was vnderstood by the wiues and kinswomen of the dead, there began a pitifull noise among them, lamenting and bewailing their
<note place="marg">Women bewaile their friends.</note>
miserable case and losses.</p>
<p>But Gald, doubting least the same should come to the eares of some espials, that might
lurke neere to the place where he was withdrawne, caused an huge shout and noise to be
raised by his people, as though it had b&eacute;ene in token of some reioising, till the women bewailing thus the deth of their friends, might be remooued out of the way. This doone, they

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"83"</fw>-->

fell to take counsell what was best to doo in this case: and in the end all things considered, it
was determined that somewhat before the dawning of the next morrow, euerie man should 
<note place="marg">The Scotish men &amp; Picts breake vp their campe.</note>
dislodge and withdraw himselfe into such a place as he thought most m&eacute;et for his safegard, saue
onelie such as were appointed to attend Gald and Garnard into Atholl, whither they minded
with all sp&eacute;ed to go.</p>
<p>Thus leauing a great number of fiers to dissemble their departure, they dislodged and made
awaie with all sp&eacute;ed possible. In the morning when their departure was once discouered, a
great number of the Romans followed as it had beene in the chase, but some of them 
<note place="marg">The Romans in pursuing vnaduisedlie are distressed.</note>
vnaduisedly aduenturing too farre forward, were inclosed by their enimies and slaine. Those that
wrought this feat got them to the next hils and so escaped. At length, when all the fields
and countries adioining were discouered, and the same appearing to be quite deliuered of all
the ambushments of the enimies, Agricola caused the spoile to be gathered, and after marched
foorth vnto Angus, where (forsomuch as summer was past) he appointed to winter, and so
<note place="marg">Agricola subdueth Angus and wintereth there.</note>
comming thither and subduing the countrie, he tooke pledges of the best amongst the inhabitants, and lodged his people about him in places most conuenient.</p>
<p>About the same time Agricola heard newes from his nauie (as then riding at anchor in 
<note place="marg">Agricola is certified of the mischance of his nauie.</note>
Argile) what mishap had chanced to the same in Pictland frith. But herewith being not greatlie
discouraged, he gaue order that the ships that had escaped, should be new rigged and furnished with all necessarie prouision, and manned throughlie, both with able mariners and men of war.
This doone, he appointed them eftsoones to attempt fortune, and to take their course againe
to come round about by the Orkenies, and so vp alongst by the east coast: which enterprise
<note place="marg">The komane fl&eacute;et saileth round about the north point of Albion.</note>
they luckilie accomplished, and in the water of Taie they burnt the Danish fl&eacute;et lieng there in
harbrough.</p>
<p>&para; Here is to be noted, that before the fore-remembred ouerthrow of the Scots and their confederats at the foot of Granzbene, there happened manie sundrie vnketh and strange sights in
this Ile. Amongst other there appeared flieng in the aire certeine firie visions, much to be 
<note place="marg">Strange visions.</note>
wondered at. Also a great peece of Kalendar wood s&eacute;emed in the night time as it had b&eacute;ene on
a flaming fire, but in the morning there appeared no such token. There was in like maner

s&eacute;ene in the aire the similitude of certeine ships. And in Angus it rained frogs. At Tuline
there was a child borne hauing both shapes, so filthie a sight to behold, that forthwith they rid
it out of the way for offending others eies. These prodigious things were diuerslie interpreted,
according to the variable fansie of man.</p>
<p>After that the prosperous successe of Agricola was once notified to the emperour Domitian,

to succ&eacute;ed him in the gouernment of Britaine, but the armie bearing more fauour vnto one
Trebellianus being cousine to Agricola, caused no small trouble amongst the souldiors, so that
in the end after certeine bickerings betwixt them, Trebellianus tooke a sort of the best souldiors away with him, and went ouer with them into France.</p>
<p>The Scots taking occasion hereof, ioined with the Picts, and entred into Angus. Whereof
Cneus Trebellianus being informed, assembled his people, who perceiuing no great forwardnesse
in their leader, created-Caius Sisinnius (brother to the forenamed Trebellianus) their capteine,
but he would in no wise meddle with that charge, though they were verie earnest in hand with
him to take it vpon him. In the meane time came the enimies vnder the leading of Gald
readie to giue the onset, wherewith the Romans being sore troubled, by reason of this discord
amongst themselues, set forward yet right valiantlie, to giue battell to their enimies: howbeit in
the end, bicause that Sisinnius receiued a mortall wound, and so departed out of the field, they
fell at length to running awaie, the Scots and Picts following in the chase right fiercelie.</p>

after for their more safegard, they got them ouer the riuer of Tay, breaking the bridge
<note place="marg">They retire backe ouer the water of Tay and breake the bridge after them.</note>
which they had made there, to the end that by the same the Scots &amp; Picts should
haue no passage in that place. But Gald hauing got this notable victorie with the spoile of
the Romans campe, thought it best with the aduise of his nobles, to pursue the Romans
without delaie, not suffering them to haue time to prouide for resistance. And herevpon
comming to the castell of Calidon otherwise Kalendar, they got ouer the riuer of Tay, by a
<note place="marg">The Scots get ouer the water of Tay n&eacute;ere to Calidon castell.</note>
bridge of wood laid ouer the same riuer, which in that place is but narrow, by reason of the
rocks &amp; cliffes forcing the banks on either side to a streictnesse.</p>
<p>The Romane capteins also not ignorant of the passage of the enimies, brought foorth
<note place="marg">The Scots eftsoones giue battell to the Romans.</note>
their armie, and made themselues readie to incounter them, but for that the forenamed
Caius Sisinnius was not able to stirre by reason of his wounds receiued in the last battell,
they chose one Titus Celius, a valiant gentleman of Rome to be their leader, and so vnder
his conduct setting vpon their enimies they fought right fiercelie for a time, but yet in the
<note place="marg">The Romans are againe discomfited.</note>
end they were put to flight, &amp; chased into Calidon. There were slaine of the Romane
part in this incounter to the number of fiue thousand, and of the Scots and other the confederats two thousand. After this victorie thus obteined by the Scots, a great number of
<note place="marg">The Britains hearing of the euill aduentures fallen to the Romans, reuolt fr&omacr; their obedience.</note>
the Britains reuolted from the Romane obedience, as those that inhabit the countrie which
we now call Wales, with the marches, slaieng &amp; chasing awaie such Romans as lay abroad
in those parties.</p>
<p>This doone, they sent vnto Gald king of the Scots, certeine messengers with rich iewels
and gifts, in token of their reioising and gladnes for his victories, promising him furthermore such aid as they were able to make against the Romans the common enimies of all
the whole Albion nation. Moreouer, in this meane while did the Romans within Calidon
<note place="marg">The Romans send vnto Marius king of the Britains for aid.</note>
castell direct their messengers with letters vnto Marius king of the Britains, signifieng vnto
him the present danger wherein things stood in those parties by the cruell rage of the
Scotishmen and Picts, whom fortune had aduanced with the gaine of two foughten fields,
insomuch that if timelie succours were not the sooner sent, the losse would be irrecouerable.
Herevnto Marius answered, that as then a common conspiracie appeared to be in hand
<note place="marg">Marius king of the Britains doubteth rebellion of his subiects.</note>
amongest his subiects, so far foorth that he doubted greatlie the suertie of his owne estate;
and as for hope of aid to be sent from Rome, he saw small likeliehood; considering the
slender prouision there through the misgouernement of cruell Domitian, who by reason of
the hatred which the people bare him, regarded nothing but how to k&eacute;epe them from rising
vp in armour against him, and therefore he thought it necessarie that leauing the north parts
<note place="marg">Marius counselleth the Romans to leaue the north parts vnto the enimies, and to draw vnto him into the south parts to k&eacute;epe the same.</note>
to the enimies, they should all withdraw towards him into the south parts, to k&eacute;epe yet the
more fruitfull portion of the Ile in due obedience, sith their puissance might not suffice to reteine &amp; rule the whole.</p>
<p>These newes greatlie abashed the Romane armie, &amp; so much the more, for that about the
same time it was shewed them how king Gald with an huge armie of Scotishmen and Picts,
was come within ten miles of them. Wherevpon the Romans not knowing at that instant
what was best for them to doo, in the end they concluded to withdraw into Cantire, where
<note place="marg">The Romans withdraw into Cantire, &amp; after into Galloway.</note>

<note place="marg">Gald pursueth the Romans.</note>
being arriued, and perceiuing themselues as yet to be in no great suertie there, they went
awaie from thence with sp&eacute;ed into Galloway. in the meane time king Gald, supposing it
best eftsoones to fight with them yer they might haue anie space to reinforce their power,
followed them with all diligence, not forcing though he left behind him diuerse castels and
fortresses furnished with sundrie garrisons of his enimies, so that he might discomfit and
chase away their maine power, which he thought might as then easilie be doone, considering
the great multitudes of people which came flocking in on each side, presenting themselues
with offering their seruice vnto him, and shewing furthermore great tokens of ioy and
gladnesse, for that it had pleased the gods at length yet to declare themselues fauourable in
this their relieuing of the oppressed Britains. Herevnto Galdus on the other side, giuing
them heartie thanks for their trauell, receiued them verie gentlie, mixing his talke with
most comfortable words, therewith to put them in hope of such good and prosperous

successe, as that shortlie they should thereby be restored intierlie vnto their former liberties, and
perpetuallie deliuered from all forren seruitude and bondage.</p>
<p>But to proce&eacute;d, at length he did so much by his iournies, that he came into Galloway,
where the Romans with all sp&eacute;ed (s&eacute;eing none other remedie) resolued themselues to giue
<note place="marg">The Romans determine againe to fight with the Scots.</note>

<note place="marg">The Romans fiercelie assaile the Scots.</note>
him battell, and therevpon exhorting one another to plaie the men, sith their onelie refuge
rested in their weapons points, they fiercelie gaue the onset, and at the first put the left wing
of the Scots and Picts wholie vnto the woorst. In which wing, according to their maner
in those daies vsed, there were a great number of women mingled amongst the men.
Gaid therefore perceiuing the danger, succoured them with such as were appointed to giue
the looking on till n&eacute;ed required, and then to go where they should be commanded. By
which meanes the battell on that side was renewed afresh, the women shewing no lesse
<note place="marg">Strange dealing in wom&emacr;, and contrarie to their nature.</note>
valiancie than the men, and therewith much more crueltie, for they spared none at all,
though they offered neuer so much to haue their liues preserued.</p>
<p>In fine, the Romans being chased in the left wing, their ouerthrow gaue occasion to all
<note place="marg">The Romans flie to their campe.</note>
the residue to fl&eacute;e backe to their campe, being pursued so egerlie by the Scots and Picts,
that they had much adoo to defend the entries of their trenches, where both parties fought
right egerlie, till at length the night parted them both in sunder. Being parted, the Scots
<note place="marg">The Scots purpose to assaile the Romane campe.</note>
gaue not themselues to rest, but prouided them of all things necessarie against the next
morning to assaile their enimies afresh, and namelie from the next wood they fetched great
plentie of fagots and brush to fill the trenches withall. But this their demeanor and 
<note place="marg">The Romans require a communication.</note>
purpose being vnderstood of the Romans, they required a communication, the which (though
some persuaded Galdus to the contrarie) vpon d&eacute;epe considerations of fortunes fraile fauor,
was at length granted vnto them, and foure ancient Romans clad in right honorable and
verie rich apparell came foorth and were admitted to the presence of the kings [Gald of
the Scots, and Garnard of the Picts] vnto whome with humble submission they 
<note place="marg">The Romans submit themselues as vanquished.</note>
acknowledged themselues as vanquished, and that by the iust wrath and reuenge of the equall gods,
which against them they had conceiued for the wrongfull inuasion of that which in no
wise of right apperteined vnto them. Therefore if it might please those kings to bridle
and refraine their displeasure against them, in licencing them vnder some reasonable conditions of appointment to depart, it should be a thing resounding so much to their fame
and glorie, as nothing could bee more; considering so humble sute made to them by the
orators of those people, who were reputed as vanquishers of the whole world.</p>
<p>Herewith falling prostrate at the f&eacute;et of those kings, they besought them of pardon, in
such pitifull wise, that the hearts of the hearers began somewhat to mollifie, and at length
Gald tooke vpon him to answer in name of all the residue of the Scotish and Pictish nations,
and in the end concluded, that they were contented to grant a peace on these conditions:
That the Romans should ceasse from that day forward in anie wise to infest or disquiet by
<note place="marg">The conditions of peace prescribed to the Romans by the Scots and Picts.</note>
way of anie inuasion the Scotish and Pictish borders, and also to depart wholie out of those
countries, restoring all such holds and fortresses as they held within the same: and further,
to deliuer all prisoners, pledges, and fugitiues whatsoeuer as then remaining in their hands,
togither with such goods &amp; spoiles as they had latelie taken.</p>
<p>These conditions being certified to the Romans by their orators, were gladlie accepted,
sith they saw no better meane how to deliuer themselues out of that present danger. And
so deliuering sufficient hostages for performance of all the articles of agr&eacute;ement, they 
<note place="marg">The Romans depart out of Galloway.</note>
departed without protracting time, marching southwards to come into Kent, where Marius
king of the south Britains soiourned as then. Agricola, as the Scotish chronicles report,
left at his departure towards Rome, to the number of thr&eacute;escore thousand men in the Romane armie, what of one and other, but now at their departure out of Galloway, there
<note place="marg">The Romans giue vp all their holds and fortresses which they kept within the Scotish or Pictish dominions.</note>
remained vnneth twentie thousand, the residue being dispatched by one meane or other.
By this conclusion of peace then, the Scots and Picts got againe the whole possession of all
such countries as the Romans had before woonne and taken away from them, as the Mers,
Louthian, the marches about Berwike, Fiffe, and Angus, with Kile, Cantire, Coningham,

and Galloway: all the Romane garrisons departing out of the fortresses and holds, and
leauing the same vnto the former owners.</p>
<p>Galdus hauing thus ended the warres with the Romans, tooke order to set good directions
amongst his people for the quier and peaceable gouernement of the commonwealth, visiting
dailie the countries abroad, the better to vnderstand the state of them, and to reforme the
same where it was needfull. Further considering that as warre br&eacute;edeth good souldiers, so
<note place="marg">Galdus studieth to preserue his subiects in good quiet now after the warres were ended.</note>
peace by iustice riddeth them out of the way, if they be not the better prouided for. Such
as had serued long time in the last wars, and had not anie trade now in time of peace
whereby to get their lining, he placed in garrisons n&eacute;ere to the borders of the Britains for
defense of the countrie. After this, hee came to an interuiew with Garnard king of the
Picts at Calidon, or Kalendar, to represse certeine troubles raised betwixt their subiects
being borderers, concerning the lmits of their countrie: where perceiuing a sort of euill
<note place="marg">Such as sought to trouble the peace were punished.</note>
disposed persons to be wholie in the fault, vpon a naughtie intent to steale, and trouble the
peace, which they had with such trauell and labour sought to restore, they punished the
offendors, and set all things in good quiet, and so departed in sunder with great loue and
friendship.</p>
<p>Thus Galdus applieng all his studie and diligence to aduance the common-wealth and
quiet state of his countrie, liued manie yeeres so highlie in the fauour of all his subiects,
that the like hath b&eacute;ene but seldome heard of: finallie, to their great griefe and displeasure
he ended his life, more d&eacute;ere to them than their owne, at Epiake, in the 35 y&eacute;ere of his

<note place="marg">Mogall nephue to Galdus is admitted king, and studieth to redresse abuses.</note>
was admitted king in his place. His cheefest studie was to reforme the decaied state of his
countrie, and first he caused such wicked councellors of his predecessors and vncle Lugthake,
as had escaped with life (when their maister was made awaie) to be put to death, according
to their iust deseruings. He restored also the due worshipping of the gods, in part as then
neglected, by the wicked counsell of their former rulers. The Scotishmen in like maner
conceiuing an assured hope of a good redresse in all their gr&eacute;efes and oppressions, by the
means of such a well disposed prince, began to beare him incredible loue and fauor, euen
<note place="marg">Mogall is beloued of his subiects.</note>

<note place="marg">The Picts desire aid of the Scots against the Romans.</note>
the like as they had doone his grandfather Galdus. In the meane time came certeine ambassadors from the Picts, vnto this Mogall, requiring him of aid against the Romans and
Britains, who by a sudden inuasion had doon much hurt in Pictland, to the great distresse
of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>At the same time they of Galloway certified him also by letters, that the same Romans
<note place="marg">The Romans inuade the Scotish borders.</note>
had made a rode into their countrie, and led awaie a great bootie of goods and prisoners.
Mogall hauing a mind no lesse giuen to d&eacute;eds of chiualrie, than to the studie of ciuill gouernment and religious deuotion, reioised that he had iust occasion giuen him to shew some
proofe of his valiant inclination, and so herevpon sent an herald at armes vnto the Romans,
requiring to haue restitution and amends for the iniuries thus by them committed. The
<note place="marg">Mogall requireth restitution of wrongsdoone by the Romans.</note>

<note place="marg">Mogall prepareth to the wars.</note>

<note place="marg">Mogall visiteth his grandfathers sepulchre.</note>

<note place="marg">The Picts and Scots ioine their powers togither and enter into the lands of their enimies.</note>

<note place="marg">Lucius Antenous licutenant of Britaine.</note>
herald dooing his message, receiued nothing but scornefull words, and disdainfull menaces,
wherby Mogall being throughlie kindled with despite, assembled his power togither foorth
of all the parties of his dominions, and comming with the same into Galloway, visited his
grandfathers sepulchre, honoring it with great reuerence and solemne supplications, requiring as it were his aid against those enimies, which had violated the league made betwixt
him and them, by solemne oths and other accustomed meanes of ratification. This doone,
he drew into Annandale, where Vnipanus as then king of the Picts abode his comming.
There ioining their powers togither, they marched foorth into Cumberland, and so forward
into Westmerland, with fire and sword wasting and spoiling those countries, as then belonging to the Romans.</p>
<p>Lucius Antenous the Romane lieutenant, lieng at the same time at Yorke, being certified
hereof by such as fled for feare out of those parties thus inuaded by the Scots, gathered a
mightie armie out of all the countries of Britaine, and hasted forth with the same towards
his enimies; of whose approch Mogall hauing notice, he made a long oration vnto his
<note place="marg">Mogall exhorteth his men to doo valiantlie.</note>
people to incourage them to fight manfullie against the Romans, persuading them effectuallie
thereto by manie familiar examples brought in of the valiant enterprises atchiued by their
elders, in the defense of the countrie and libertie of the same. In like maner Lucius Antenous for his part exhorted the Romans, and other his souldiers, to call to remembrance
the victorious exploits of their predecessors, and how that as then then they should fight but
with a rude and barbarous people, running to battell more vpon a furious rage and violent
madnes, than with any discretion or aduised order, saieng furthermore, that it laie now in
their hands with no great adoo to recouer that which through the negligent sloth of Cneus
Trebellius was before lost, whereby they should atteine great honor and famous renowme
for euermore.</p>
<p>By this meanes the armies on both sides being kindled with desire of battell, in hope of
victorie, they drew neere togither, and began the fight right fiercelie at the first, with 
<note place="marg">The battell be ginneth betweene the Romans and Albions.</note>
throwing and shooting of darts and arrowes so thicke that one might vnneth s&eacute;e another. The
place was more for the aduantage of the Scots than of the Romans, bicause they were compelled to fight as it were by companies and parts, by reason of bogs and marishes, with
such sideling banks on the sides that they could k&eacute;epe none araie: yet all these impediments notwithstanding, this battell was fought so far forth to the vtterance, that in the end,

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"after"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"88"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

after a woonderfull slaughter on both sides made, when their swords and other weapons
<note place="marg">A cruell fight.</note>
were spent, they buckled togither with short daggers.</p>
<p>Finallie the violent charge of the Scots &amp; Picts was such, that the Romans were 
<note place="marg">The Romans retire.</note>
constreined to retire, which their generall Antenous perceiuing, did what he could to staie them,
and to bring them forward againe, but as he was most busie in the forefront to exhort them
hervnto, he was wounded with an arrow, and therevpon departed out of the battell, which
<note place="marg">Lucius Antenous is wounded.</note>

<note place="marg">The Romans are put to flight.</note>
gaue occasion to diuers other of his companie to follow him, by meanes whereof all the
residue fell to running awaie, and made toward the next wood, there to saue themselues as
well as they might, though some companies perceiuing that they could not reach thither
without manifest danger, closed themselues togither and departed by another waie, which
they tooke at aduenture, not knowing towards what parts they drew, so that they laie all
the night following within two miles of the Scots and Picts, who for that the daie was in
maner spent (before the Romans were put to flight) incamped themselues in the selfe-same
place where the battell was fought, and in the morning, hearing that part of their enimies
were lodged so n&eacute;ere them, &amp; knew not which waie to draw, they sent a number foorth
of their campe to fight with them, &amp; to kill them if they resisted, or to bring them captiue
to the king if they should seeme willing to y&eacute;eld. Those that were thus sent, found the
Romans in verie good order of battell for so small a band, not minding to y&eacute;eld themselues
as prisoners. By reason of which their obstinate wilfulnesse, they were slaine in the end
euerie mothers sonne.</p>
<p>Lucius Antenous hauing thus receiued the ouerthrow, dispatched a post vnto Rome with all
hast, signifieng vnto the emperor Adrian the whole maner of the discomfiture, and how that
by reason therof things stood in great danger here in Britaine, if sp&eacute;edie succors were
not the sooner sent, for the enimies were neuer more cruell and fierce, than at this present,
<note place="marg">Women as readie to the battell as the men.</note>
not onelie the men, but also the women (as in the last battell he saw plaine proofe) who
cared not for the losse of their owne liues, so that they might die reuenged.</p>
<p>When Adrian vnderstood these newes, he purposed forthwith to go himselfe into 
<note place="marg">Adrian the emperor prepareth to go into Britain.</note>

<note place="marg">Adrian transporteth into Britaine.</note>

<note place="marg">Adrian commeth to Yorke.</note>
Britaine. Causing therefore an armie to be leuied, he passed foorth with the same into France,
then called Gallia, and comming to Calice, he transported ouer into Britaine, where he
learned how the Scots and Picts were neuer more busie than at this present, hauing of late
wasted and spoiled the countrie euen to the riuer of Tine. Herewith Adrian being sore
offended, ioined the power which he had brought with him fr&omacr; Rome, with the other which
he had caused to be raised in France and Britaine. This doone, he remooued to Yorke,
where soiorning certeine daies to refresh his people, he afterwards drew toward the borders,

<note place="marg">Adrian findeth nothing abroad in the countrie of his enimies.</note>

<note place="marg">What maner of people he had to doo withall.</note>
and c&omacr;ming to the riuer of Tine, he passed ouer the same.</p>
<p>The fourth daie after, he came into a countrie wherein was left no kind of earthlie thing
seruing to mans vse, and so passing forward a daie or two, he found neither corne, nor
other prouision of vittell, nor any kind of liuing creature, all the people being fled into the
mounteins and marish grounds, where no man might come vnto them, as commonlie in
case of extreme danger they were accustomed to lie abroad in the same without house or
any couerture ouer their heads. Howbeit, for all that he gaue not ouer to pursue them,
but finding them out where they lurked in the hilles and woods, he gr&eacute;euouslie afflicted
them, and that in sundrie maner. In the end espieng the barrennes of the soile, the rudenes of the people, and that there was no hope left to come by sufficient prouision for the
maintenance of his armie, he determined not to spend anie longer time in such a vaine
and fruitlesse trauell, and therefore returned vnto Tine, there to restreine the Scots and Picts
from inuading such of the Britains as were subiect to the Romane empire, he caused a
<note place="marg">Adrian beginneth to make a wall for safegard of the Britains against the Picts and Scots.</note>

<note place="marg">The Romane writers doo confirme the same.</note>
great trench to be cast ouerthwart the land from the mouth of Tine to the riuer of Eske,
and a wall to be made on the inner side of the same, of turfe and sods. &para; The Scotish
chronicles make mention that it was begun by Adrian, but not finished till the daies of the
emperor Seuerus, who made an end of it, and therfore the same chronicles name it the
wall of Septimius Seuerus.

Adrianus hauing thus dispatched in the north parts of Britaine, in his returne visited Wales
with the marches of the same, setting an order amongst such as had mooued a commotion
against the magistrats in those parties, the authors whereof he punished according to their

<note place="marg">Aulus Victorinus lieutenant of Britaine.</note>
Britaine nobilitie resorted to doo him honor, according to their duties. And he for his part
shewed them such friendlie interteinment, that they could not wish any better. After this
he sailed into France, taking Lucius Antenous with him, bicause he could not awaie with
the aire of Britaine, in whose place he left one Aulus Victorinus lieutenant there, who disposed diuers garisons of souldiers in places n&eacute;ere vnto the fore-remembred wall, for defense
of the inhabitants against the violence of the Scots &amp; Picts. Who seeing this demeanour of
the Romans, diuided those lands and countries (which they had latelie wasted on the

further side of Tine) in such sort betwixt them, that all whatsoeuer laie towards the Irish sea,
remained to the Scots, and the rest coasting vpon the Almane seas, fell vnto the Picts for
their portion.</p>
<p>After this Mogall liued manie yeares in good quiet without anie trouble of enimies.
But being puffed vp in pride, by such notable victories as he had thus got of the Romans
the conquerours of the world, he could not in time of peace maister his owne vnrulie appetites; but that drowned in the filthie lustes of the bodie, he spared neither maid, widowe,
nor wife. Againe, he was giuen to such vnquenchable couetousnesse, that nothing might
suffice him, finding manie forged matters against the rich, whereby to bereue them both
of life and substance. He was the first which ordeined that such as were banished or condemned for anie crime, should forfeit all their lands &amp; goods without any consideration had
<note place="marg">A couetous and cruell ordinance.</note>
either of wife or child, which is obserued at the full euen vnto these our-daies, where before

<p>The morning being come, and knowledge had how he was thus departed, the conspiratours pursued after him. who perceiuing them to approch, sought waies how to haue
escaped their hands; but such was his hap, that he fell amongest other that were as readie

realme, of euerie person according to their abilities, for the maintenance of such superfluous
expenses as he dailie vsed in excessiue banketting. The lords maruelling to heare him moue
anie such demand, and considering withall the occasion thereof, they asked respit to make
their answer till the next day: which being granted, in the night following they communed
<note place="marg">The lords conspire against Conarus.</note>
secretlie togither, and in the end concluded, not onelie to denie his request, but also to depose him of all kinglie gouernement, sith his naughtie life required no lesse.</p>
<p>The next day therefore when they were againe set downe in the councell-chamber, one of
them in name of the residue tooke vpon him to speake, declaring that the lords and commons
<note place="marg">The answere of the lords to the demand of Conarus.</note>
of the realme maruelled not a little how it should come to passe, that the king hauing no
warres wherewith to consume his treasure, should yet be inforced to demand a tallage for
maintenance of his estate and charges of his houshold; but the fault was knowen well
inough to rest in such as he most vnworthilie had preferred to rule things vnder him, who
being come of naught did nothing but deuise means how to cause the king to spoile his
naturall subiects of their goods and possessions, therewith to inrich themselues, but (saith
he) as they shal be prouided for well inough yer long, and so aduanced as they snall not
need to thirst for other mens liuings, that is to wit, euen to a faire paire of gallowes, there
to end their liues with shame, as a number of such other loosengers had often doone before
them: so it is conuenient that the K. sith his skill is so small in the administration of his
office, should be shut vp in some one chamber or other, and such a one to haue the gouernance of the realme, as may be thought by common assent of the lords most meet to take
it vpon him.</p>
<p>The king hearing this tale, started vp,. &amp; with a lowd voice began to call them traitors;
adding, that if they went about anie hurt to his person, they shuld deerelie abide the bargaine. But notwithstanding these words, such as were appointed therto, caught him

resistance. In like maner, all such as had borne offices vnder him, were attached and had
to prison, where the most part of them, vpon examination taken of their offenses, suffered
death according to their iust demerits.</p>
<p>Then was the rule of the realme committed vnto one Argadus, a man of noble birth, and
ruler of Argile, who vnder the name of a gouernour tooke vpon him the publike regiment,
vntill other aduise might be taken. This mans studie in the beginning was onelie to clense
the countrie of all misdooers, and to see the peace kept to the quiet of the people; &amp;
finallie in all his dooings shewed himselfe a perfect patterne of an vpright iusticer. But
<note place="marg">Argadus an vpright iusticer.</note>

<note place="marg">Prosperitie changeth conditions.</note>
within a few yeares after (as it often happeneth) prosperous successe changed his former
mind to an euill disposition, whereby he ordered things after his owne selfewill more than by
reason, without the aduise of his p&eacute;eres. And further, to the manifest ruine of the commonwealth, he nourished ciuill discord and sedition amongest the nobles, supposing it to make
for his welfare, so long as they were at ods. He also maried a Pictish ladie, the better to
strengthen himselfe by this his forren aliance.</p>
<p>Herevpon the p&eacute;eres of the realme, vnderstanding what mischiefe might insue by these
manifold and sundrie abuses of the gouernour, caused a parlement to be called, where, in
presence of the whole assemblie, they laid vnto his charge, how that (through his

misgouernement and presumption, not onelie in coupling himselfe in mariage with a wife of a
strange nation, but also for attempting manie other things preiudiciall to the estate of the
realme, without consent of the nobles or commons of the same) he had deserued grieuous
punishment; his trespasse being so much the greater, in that considering the meane how he
came to that dignitie, he answered not their expectation, nor performed the trust and credit

mooued with this humble submission of Argadus, vpon promise he should redresse all his

But such as had beene his chiefest councellors were committed to ward. After this sharpe
<note place="marg">Argadus amendeth his former misgo uernance, and ruleth himselfe by better aduise.</note>
admonition and warning thus giuen, Argadus did nothing touching the gouernement of the
common-wealth, without aduise of his peeres; and soone after, amongest other things, he
tooke order for the limiting how far the authoritie of inferiour officers, as bailiffes, boroughmaisters, constables, and such other should extend. But especiallie he trauelled most diligentlie for the punishing of theeues and robbers, of whome none escaped with life that fell
into his hands. Moreouer, he ordeined by statute, that no man exercising anie publike

office, should taste of anie drinke that might make him drunked. He also banished all
such persons as vsed with dressing of delicat meats, and (as I may call them) deintie dishes,
or banketing ch&eacute;ere, to allure mens appetites from the old rude fare accustomed amongest
their elders, who sought not to follow their delicious appetites, but onlie prouided to susteine
nature, which is satisfied with a little, &amp; that void of costlie furniture. Argadus thus being
occupied in reforming the state of the common-wealth, brought manie euill dooers into
good frame and order, and such as were vpright liuers of themselues, indeuored still to

herevnto, that the Scots and Picts had first begun to breake downe the foresaid wall, and

to build a tower vpon the same, fortifieng it with a number of men of warre, who running

could he neuer haue anie towardlie answer, so that he was constreined to begin the warre

after to come, and to iome with him in such a necessarie enterprise against the common
enimies of both their countries. The Pictish king giuing thanks to the messenger for his
pains, promised with all sp&eacute;ed to set forward according to the aduise of Ethodius. The
Romans in like maner hauing knowledge of the whole intention of the two kings, with all

was to be had in the Britains, being no lesse readie vpon occasion to make warres in recouerie of their libertie, than the Scots &amp; Picts were to incroch vpon them. The emperour
vpon receit of these letters, thought in his mind that Victorine was not so valiant a capteine
as the case required, and that therevpon the Scots and Picts became the more imboldened
to resist, therefore he sent for him home, appointing one Agricola Calphurnius to succ&eacute;ed
<note place="marg">Victorine is sent for to returne vnto Rome, and one Calphurnius sent into Britaine to succ&eacute;ed in his roome.</note>

<note place="marg">Calphurnius entreth into the borders of his enimies.</note>
in his roome, who was (as some haue left in writing) the nephue of Iulius Agricola, the
most famous capteine of the Romans that euer came into Britaine.</p>
<p>This Calphurnius comming into Britaine with an armie, ioined to the same the power
which he found there, as well of the Britains, as of other seruing vnder the Romane ensignes. Which doone, he repaired toward the riuer of fine, where being arriued, he marched
foorth into the borders of his enimies, finding all the countrie round about him so clearelie
wasted and burned, that there was not a house left standing, nor a graine of corne, nor one
hed of cattell to be found therein. Yet notwithstanding all this, foorth he passed thorough
Northumberland, and entring into Pictland, wasted all that was before him with fire and
sword. And for so much as winter came vpon him, when he had doone his will in that

<p>When summer was once come, hauing made his prouision to warre on the Scots and

against the Romans, so that taking order for the reparing of the wall made by Adrian,
which the enimies in diuers places had broken downe, and leauing a sufficient number of

without much adoo, he reduced to obedience. Immediatlie after this, he heard also how the Brirains of the Ile of Wight were vp in armour against such Romans as ruled there, sundrie noble
men of the maine Ile taking their part, but they also were at length brought againe to their former subiection, and the authors of that rebellion punished by death.</p>
<p>In the meane time the Scots and Picts determined not to attempt anie further exploit
against the Romans, doubting the verie name and linage of Agricola in the lieutenant Cal
phurnius, by calling to remembrance the noble atchiued conquests of his grandfather Iulius
Agricola, of whose victorious exploits, besides that which ye haue before heard, the English
historie also dooth make a long rehearsall. Calphurnius being thus at quiet on that
side, intended wholie to reforme all misorders amongest the Britains, which being brought
to indifferent good passe, he was sent for home againe vnto Rome by the emperour Antonius
Comm&otilde;dus, the sonne and successour of the fore-remembred Marcus Aurelius sending one
Publius Trebellius into Britaine, there to supplie his charge.</p>
<p>This Trebellius comming into Britaine, at the first vsed himselfe verie vprightlie in his office,
shewing all honor and loue towards the Britains, subiects to the Romane empire, and namelie
to Lucius, who reigned as king of the land, vnder the name and authoritie of the Romane
empire. But after that he had once woone him a p&eacute;ece of credit amongest them, he changed
his maners, or rather discouered his naturall inclination, so wholie giuen to couetousnesse, that
his onelie studie was set which way to fill his bags, not caring how vntrulie he forged accusations against the rich, so that either by death or banishment their goods might be confiscat, and
so come to his hands. By this wicked gouernement, the Britains began so sore to hate him,
<note place="marg">He is hated of the Britains.</note>
that had it not b&eacute;ene for the loue of their king the foresaid Lucius (who holpe to appease them)
there had b&eacute;ene some rebellion practised against him in the south part. Now the Scots and
<note place="marg">The Scots and Picts renew the warre against the Romans.</note>
Picts hauing knowledge of this misliking in the Britains towards the Romane lieutenant,
thought it a time conuenient for them also to be dooing, to the end they might reuenge their
former iniuries; and herevpon leuieng an armie, they came to the oft remembred wall,
and ouerthrowing the same in diuers places, they entred into the British confins with great
spoile and crueltie. Trebellius being hereof informed, hasted forth with all the power he
<note place="marg">Trebellius fighteth against his enimies, is forsaken of his owne men, and chased out of the field.</note>
could make, to resist their inuasions; but finding the enimies readie in the field, and incountring them sooner than he looked for, he was euen vpon the first ioining abandoned of the
most part of his whole armie, which consisted of Britains and Frenchmen, then called Galls, so
that the residue being beaten downe, he was glad to saue himselfe as well as he might, by setting the spurs to his horsse and galloping away.</p>
<p>After this, gathering togither his people againe as they fled from the discomfiture, he retired
backe with them vnto Yorke, hauing lost in this bickering a great number of his best souldiors,
and men of warre: for the Scots and Picts, missing no small number of their friends in that
battell, were not satisfied with those whome they had likewise slaine in the fight, but also fell
vpon their prisoners which they had taken, and slue them also in reuenge of their fellowes
whome they had lost. Afterwards they harried the countries of Westmerland and Kendall in
<note place="marg">Westmerland and Kendall spoiled by the Scotishmen and Picts.</note>

<note place="marg">The British commons rise against Trebellius, one Caldorus a Pict b&eacute;eing their capteine.</note>

<note place="marg">The same commons are vanquished.</note>

<note place="marg">Caldorus reioiseth at the slaughter as well of the one part as of the other.</note>
most cruell wise, Trebellius not being so hardie to fight with them againe for doubt of some
traine that might be practised by the Britains. Neither was his suspicion grounded vpon the
credit of any light information, as may appeare by that which followed: for immediatlie after,
the commons of the countrie rose against the Romans, in purpose to haue driuen them all out
of the land.</p>
<p>Their capteine was one Caldorus a Pict borne. There were also diuerse of the British nobilitie amongst them not knowne, for they were disguised in strange apparell, counterfeting
themselues to be of the vulgar sort. The furie of these people was great, but yet in the end
the politike order of the Romans vanquished them, howbeit not without great slaughter on
both sides. Caldorus escaping the hands of his enimies, fled into his natiue countrie of Pictland, not a little reioising that he had procured such slaughter amongst the Romans and Britains, both being enimies to him and his countrie. Such prisoners also of the Britains as fell

<note place="marg">The spite of the Britains shewed towards the Romans.</note>

<note place="marg">Trebellius writeth to the emperor Commodus for aid.</note>
of the Britains being offended, in the night season tooke down those dead bodies, and hanged
vp as manie of the Romans in their places, the truth being neuer knowne who were the
dooers of that act.</p>
<p>The lieutenant Trebellius perceiuing thus what danger he stood in on euerie part, wrote
vnto the emperour Commodus, that without some reformation were had, the Romans were not
like to keepe foot anie long season in Britaine, and therefore required to haue some aid sent
ouer vnto him in time. But the emperour doubting least the fault rested most in the lieutenant himselfe, appointed that one Pertinax an ancient gentleman, and one for his high and
<note place="marg">Pertinax sent as lieutenant into Britaine.</note>
notable vertues greatlie esteemed both amongst the men of warre, and also in the senat, should
go into Britaine, to be legat there in place of Trebellius. This Pertinax comming into Britaine,
according to the emperors appointment, tooke vpon him the office: and first setting a staie
among the Britains, by right prudent and well aduised gouernement, he afterwards made a
iourneie against the Scots and Picts, driuing them by great slaughter beyond Adrians wall, and
<note place="marg">Pertinax driueth back both the Scots and Picts.</note>

<note place="marg">Pertinax is chosen emperour.</note>
so constreined them to remaine wishin their owne confines, pursuing them no further, for that
he was sent for home to Rome, where the emperour Commodus being murthered amongst
his owne men, he was against his will preferred to his place.</p>
<p>About the same time the state of the Scotish common wealth was brought into great danger
through an other incident, as by reason of a rebellion stirred by them of the western Iles, who
not quieted in their stomachs for the death of their friends executed by Argadus (as before ye
haue heard) assembled themselues togither, and comming ouer into Argile, spoiled and harried
<note place="marg">Argile infested by the Ilandmen.</note>
the countrie in pitious wise. For redresse whereof, Argadus was sent thither againe with an
armie, and in the meane time Ethodius the king with a great host of Scotishmen and Picts lay
in campe n&eacute;ere vnto Adrians wall, to resist the inuasion of the enimies on that side, if happilie
they shuld attempt any new exploit against him in those parts. The Iland-men hearing of
Argadus his approch, drew themselues togither to receiue him by battell, if he minded to
offer it.</p>
<p>In which meane time two thousand Irishmen were landed in that countrie, in hope of spoile,
<note place="marg">The Irish men land in Argile.</note>

<note place="marg">The Irish men lay an ambush to intrap Argadus.</note>

<note place="marg">Argadus is slaine.</note>
and hearing that Argadus was comming that waies forth to fight with his enimies, they laid
themselues secretlie in ambush by the waie where h&eacute;e should passe, and when he was passed
by them, they brake foorth vpon his rereward suddenlie, putting his people in such disorder
by their violent impression at the first brunt, that though he did what in him laie to bring
them againe into araie of battell, yet in the end he was there slaine with two thousand of his
armie, the residue escaping by flight out of the hands of their wild and cruell enimies. Ethodius hauing knowledge hereof, with an armie of twentie thousand men hasted foorth towards
Argile, to reuenge the death of his valiant capteine Argadus vpon the rebels. Who hearing
of his comming, made towards the sea, and would gladlie haue b&eacute;ene gone, but by reason of
a contrarie wind they were forced to stay against their wils, so that he finding them still in the
countrie, wrought so warilie by closing them vp among the hils and mounteins, that finallie
constreined through famine, they submitted themselues vpon these conditions, that their head
<note place="marg">The Ilandmen y&eacute;eld themselues.</note>
capteine with two hundred others of the chiefest, should y&eacute;eld themselues simplie to the kings
mercie, and the residue to be licenced to depart againe into their countries.</p>
<p>Those that were appointed to be deliuered to the king with their capteine, suffered death
<note place="marg">Execution.</note>
by sentence of the nobles and p&eacute;eres of the realme. Whereat the other taking indignation,
though they had alreadie y&eacute;elded vp their weapons, yet began they to fall vpon the Scots
with hurling of stones, and other such things as came to hand, till finallie they were beaten
downe by the armed soldiers, and a great number of them slaine: the residue escaping as
well as they might, fled into the mounteins. The Ilandmen being thus vanquished, and the
Romans attempting nothing against the Scotishmen or Picts, Ethodius visited all the parts of
<note place="marg">Ethodius visiteth his countries, to s&eacute;e iustice mainteined.</note>
his realme, taking order for the due execution of iustice amongest his subiects.</p>
<p>And for that he would not spend his time in idlenesse, being now at rest from warres, he
began to exercise himselfe in hunting, and for the better nourishing of game, he tooke order

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"that"</fw>-->

<pb n="95"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"95"</fw>-->

that all such ordinances as had b&eacute;ene deuised by his elders, should streictlie be obserued and
<note place="marg">He giueth him selfe to hunting &amp; causeth the lawes for the maintenance of game to be wel kept &amp; looked vnto.</note>
kept: as that no man should be so hardie to go about to destroie anie hares with nets, grens or
hare-pipes: neither to kill them in their formes by anie meanes: nor after that they had b&eacute;ene
once coursed and escaped, to follow the sute, to the intent to start them againe. Also that
none should go about to kill anie hart or hind, during all the winter season, at what time they
were accustomed for hunger to leaue the mounteins, forrests and woods, and to come downe
into the fields and couerts n&eacute;ere vnto the townes &amp; houses.</p>
<p>He ordeined moreouer therevnto, that no man should presume to kill anie hind-calues, detesting nothing more than to haue such game destroied, as serued for the exercise and solace
of him and his nobles. The other vacant time, whilest he rested from hunting, he spent for
the most part in hearing of musike, hauing diuerse cunning plaiers of sundrie kinds of instruments attending in his court. At length setting all his pleasure in hearing of a musician being
borne in one of the west Iles, he was murthered by him in the night time within his owne
<note place="marg">Ethodius murthered by a musician.</note>

<note place="marg">194 <emph>H. B.</emph></note>
chamber. The murtherer being apprehended, and examined vpon what occasion he did that
heinous fact, for the which he had deserued the most extreme kind of punishment that might
be deuised, he answered: that in reuenge of the death of such his kinsm&eacute;n and friends as the
king had caused to be executed in Argile, he purposed long before to doo that deed, and now
that he had accomplished his purpose, he was readie to receiue what kind of death they would
adjudge him vnto. For sure I am of this, saith he, that how terrible soeuer my execution
shall be, yet can it not b&eacute;e so painfull, but that I shall reioise euen in the verre instant of my
death, for that I haue in such notable sort reuenged the deaths of all my kinsmen &amp; friends.
Finallie by commandement of the magistrates he was drawne in peeces with wild horsses in
most violent wise.</p>
<p>Ethodius reigned 33 y&eacute;eres, vntill the latter daies of Caracalla the emperor. He was

thought insufficient to haue so great a charge as the rule of a kingdome committed vnto his

of the realme he caused to be dulie punished: finallie he tooke such order for reformation
of things, that he reduced his subiects as it had beene from a wild and sauage rudenesse, vnto
a perfect ciuill trade of humanitie. About the same time Lucius king of the Britains being
dead, the Romans perceiuing that a kings authoritie among the Britains, did nothing else but
diminish the maiestie of the imperiall iurisdiction amongst them, determined not to suffer any
more of the British nation to inioy that title.</p>
<p>This thing mooued the Britains to such indignation, that by procurement of one Fulgentius,
diuers of them rebelled, and choosing the same Fulgentius to their generall, they directed a
<note place="marg">The Britains rebell and choose one Fulgentius to their captein, who sendeth for aid vnto the Scotishmen.</note>

the nobilitie and ancient inhabitors of the same: adding furthermore, that if he would now
put to his helping hand, the time neuer serued better for the dispatching of them wholie out
of the Ile, considering the sundrie rebellions attempted as well by the people of Germanie and
France, as also of the easterlie nations and countries.</p>
<p>Donald receiued the messenger most friendlie, and being glad to vnderstand of these newes,
he promised to aid Fulgentius with all the power he was able to make, and to m&eacute;et him at

such daie and place as he should afterward appoint. The like answer was made also by the
king of Picts, vnto whome in semblable wise Fulgentius had directed his letters. Thus the
Britains (being confirmed with hope of great aid from the Scots and Picts) assembling their
host togither, resorted vnto the wall of Adrian, which they ouerthrew in diuers places, that
their friends might haue the more fr&eacute;e accesse and entrie vnto them by the same. Neither
were the Scots and Picts slow for their part to make forward: so that they likewise comming
thither, holpe to throw down that wall, and to fill vp the trench or ditch that went alongst
the same.</p>
<p>This doone, ioining their powers togither, they passed forth towards Yorke, in hope to

on euerie side, constreining the most part of the people to come in and y&eacute;eld themselues vnder
their obeisance. Thus they continued in passing from one quarter of the countrie to another, till winter inforced them to breake vp their campe, and to licence the souldiers to depart
home into their countries, till they had new summons to assemble and meet againe.</p>
<p>In this meane time Trebellius certified the emperor Seuerus of all this trouble and rebellion

in Britaine: whervpon h&eacute; with all sp&eacute;ed leuied an armie, &amp; set forward with the same himselfe
in person toward Britaine, as in the English historie more plainlie may app&eacute;ere. At his
comming into Britaine, he slacked no time, but assembling his power, prepared to go against
the enimies. Fulgentius doubting the force of his enimie, sent ambassadors vnto him to
treat for peace, but Seuerus would not grant to anie, wherevpon Fulgentius confirmed the
<note place="marg">Fulgentius incourageth the Britains to sticke vnto their begun enterprise.</note>
minds of the Britains with all comfortable words, in the best wise he could, exhorting them
to sticke to their necessarilie begun enterprise, for recouerie of their long wished libertie, which
he doubted not, but by vanquishing the emperor at that present they should assuredlie atteine:
and as for victorie, he was in no doubt, so that they would plucke their harts vnto them, and
trie it forth manfullie by dint of sword, like fellowes and brethren knit in one faithfull band
of trustie concord, considering the enimies armie being gathered of so manie sundrie nations
&amp; languages that consent in one opinion, the cheefest meane for the obteining of victory must

<note place="marg">Seuerus commeth to Yorke.</note>
south parts to haue the gouernance of the same in his absence. His eldest sonne Antoninus
he tooke with him in his iournie against his enimies. At his comming to Yorke, he did sacrifice
to the gods, according to the Ethnish custome, &amp; also tooke aduise with his capteins how to
proc&eacute;ed in his enterprise against his enimies.</p>
<p>This doone he marcheth forth with his armie towards them, who being alreadie ioined with
the Scots and Picts, were determined to abide him, insomuch that those of the one side came
no sooner in sight of the other, but that they hasted foorth to ioine togither in battell, whereof
<note place="marg">Seuerus is in countred by his enimies.</note>
insued great slaughter betwixt them, though the British part (notwithstanding their aid of
Scots and Picts) were not able long to endure against the great multitude and practised skill of
the Romane souldiers, so that in the end they were opened perforce and put to flight with the
<note place="marg">Fulgentius is put to flight and his armie discomfited.</note>
losse of thirtie thousand, what of Britains, Scotishmen and Picts.</p>
<p>Fulgentius himselfe, seeing the discomfiture and huge slaughter made of his people, had
runne in amongst the thickest prease of his enimies, had not those that were about him led him
awaie by force, and so at length he got him amongst the troops of the Scotishmen and Picts,
and togither with them passed ouer Tine, and so into the borders of his friends where he got 
<note place="marg">Fulgentius withdraweth into Pictland.</note>
togither such souldiers as he could, that had escaped from the battell, and reteined them with
wages so well as he might, in hope vpon occasion to imploie them eftsoones against his enimies.
The Scots also sent into Ireland for aid, and the Picts into Denmarke and Norwaie. Such of
the British nobilitie as fell into the hands of the Romans, Seuerus punished most gr&eacute;euouslie,
but the commons he vsed more gentlie, as it were making excuse for them being procured
thereto by their capteins. After this, when winter was come, he appointed his men of warre
to draw vnto places conuenient for them to lodge in, till the next spring. He himselfe 
<note place="marg">Seuerus wintereth at Yorke.</note>
wintered at Yorke.</p>
<p>In the next summer there was little doone worthie to be spoken of, but that there were certeine skirmishes betwixt the Romans lieng on the borders, and the Scots and Picts, euer as occasion serued, either of the parties to worke any exploit for their aduantage. But forsomuch
as the Scots had no aid sent them foorth of Ireland, they were not minded to ieopard againe
in a foughten field, supposing it sufficient if they might defend their owne, though they gained nothing as then, considering the puissance that was readie bent against them. At length
Seuerus fell sicke at Yorke, and his son Antoninus lieng on the borders beyond Tine, caused

<note place="marg">The wall is repared.</note>
the wall afore mentioned, diuiding the Britains from the Scots and Picts, to be repared. This
wall was built (as is before recited) first by Adrian the emperor, to staie the Scotishmen from
inuading the lands apperteining to the subiects of the Romane empire, &amp; after ouerthrowne
in diuers places as well by Scots and Picts, as by the Britains, in sort as before is partlie mentioned. Antoninus caused it to be fortified with bastilions, one placed so n&eacute;ere to another, as
trumpets being appointed in each of them, the sound might be heard betwixt to warne one
another vpon the first descrieng of the enimies approch.</p>

into Pictland, he receiued sufficient pledges, and then returned towards London, where his
mother with his brother Geta as then laie. Shortlie after both the brethren departed forth of
the Ile, &amp; went to Rome, as in the historie of England it appeereth. But now to returne
vnto Donald the Scotish king, ye shall vnderstand, that being deliuered of forren trouble, he
<note place="marg">Donald studious to mainteine his subiects in peace and concord.</note>
studied ch&eacute;eflie how to preserue his people in good peace and perfect tranquillitie. Which

Christ through all parts of the world, sent with all sp&eacute;ed into Scotland such well disposed
persons as he thought most m&eacute;et for that purpose, who at their arriuall there, did their endeuour in such diligent sort, that not onelie the king, but also through his example a great

priuilie stole awaie from them, and would haue passed ouer into Ila, one of the westerne Iles,
to haue procured some succor there, but being imbarked and set from the shore, he was by
contrarie winds driuen backe againe to land, where doubting to come into his enimies hands, he

he had reigned the space of 12 y&eacute;eres. His reigne continued till the daies of the emperor
Gordian the third, or (as others saie) till the time of the emperor Valerian. But as
William Harison hath gathered, he reigned in the daies of the emperor Aurelius Claudius.
Doorus the brother of Athirco vnderstanding of the death of his brother, disguised himselfe
in beggers weed for doubt of death, and went into Pictland with thr&eacute;e of his nephues, sonnes
to the same Athirco, whose names were Sindocke, Carance, and Donald.</p>

that if they found him, they should dispatch him out of life, for feare of further mischeefe.
But they that were sent, finding one in all features and proportion of bodie resembling Doorus,
slue the one in stead of the other, and so returning home to their maister, they made him verie
ioifull of the newes, although ind&eacute;ed they came not n&eacute;ere to Doorus. Then Natholocus
causing the estates of the realme to assemble, he handled the matter in such wise, by disuading
them to choose any of Athircos bloud to reigne ouer them (for doubt least they should s&eacute;eke
any meanes how to reuenge his death) that in the end this Natholocus was elected himselfe,

<note place="marg">Doorus writeth vnto certeine Scotish lords to moue them to rebellion.</note>
change of countenance after hir old accustomed guise. For Doorus the brother of Athirco
(whome, as ye haue heard, Natholocus supposed to haue b&eacute;ene dead) wrote certeine letters,
signifieng his owne estate with the welfare of his nephues the children of Athirco vnto
certeine Scotish lords, whom he knew to fauour his cause. Which letters he deliuered
vnto a Pictish woman, appointing hir how and to whome she should deliuer the same, but
the woman apprehended by the waie, and brought vnto Natholocus, he caused hir secretlie

<p>Which wicked d&eacute;ed being once notified abroad, so mooued the harts of their friends and alies,
that they procured the people to rebell: and so gathering them togither, they raised open
and cruell warres against him. Natholocus informed of their determinations, withdrew
himselfe priuilie into Murrey land, there to get togither an armie to resist his enimies, and for
that he was desirous also to vnderstand somwhat of the issue of this trouble, he sent one

knowen within these few daies. The gentleman hearing these words, railed against hir
verie bitterlie, bidding hir go like an old witch; for he trusted to s&eacute;e hir burnt before he

<note place="marg">What happened by giuing credit to the woords of a witch.</note>

told him, the king might happilie conceiue some great suspicion, that it should follow by
his means as she had declared, and therevpon put him to death first; and for feare on the
other side, that if he k&eacute;epe it secret, it might happen to be reuealed by some other, and
then he to run in as much danger of life as before; he determined with himselfe to worke
the surest way, and so comming to the king, he was led aside by him into his priuie chamber, where all other being c&omacr;manded to auoid, he declared hew he had sped; and then
falling foorthwith vpon Natholocus, with his dagger he slue him outright, and threw his

bodie into a priuie; and afterwards getting out by a backe doore, and taking his horsse
which he had there readie, he fled with all sp&eacute;ed vnto the campe of the conspirators, and

came it then to passe with him at this present: for one Donald of the Iles, a noble man
borne, came ouer with an armie into Rosse and Murrey land, fetching from thence a great
spoile and bootie, not without great slaughter of such as inforced themselues for to resist
him. The occasion as he pretended was to reuenge the death of Natholocus. But Findocke vnderstanding his dooings, prepared an armie with ships, and sailed ouer with the
same into the Ile of Ila, where incountring with Donald and other his enimies, he vanquished
and chased them egerlie, without returning once backe, till either the sword or the sea had
made an end of them all.</p>
<p>Donald himselfe taking a bote, in hope to haue escaped, the prease was such at his entring
into the same, that before they could get it off from the shore, it sunke by means of the
ouerlading, and so he and all they that were on boord were drowned therewithall. The
king hauing atchiued this victorie, returned into Albanie; but the Iland-men not fullie
quieted with this slaughter of their fellows, sent ouer into Ireland, and got from thence
certeine Kerns, who vnder the leading of an other Donald, the sonne of the former Donald,
made starts now and then into Argile and Cantire, dooing manie shrewd turnes in the same,
yer they could be suppressed. But Findocke being soone informed of these tidings, went
ouer againe into the Iles, and such of his enimies as he found, he caused to be hanged, to
giue other example what to looke for when they should rebell, but Donald escaped, and
got ouer into Ireland, where he remained, till he heard that the king was returned backe
into Albanie, and then he came againe. But perceiuing himselfe not able to worke such
<note place="marg">Donald offereth to y&eacute;eld himselfe vpon certeine conditions, but is not receiued.</note>
feats as he hoped to haue doone, he sent a messenger vnto the king, offering to y&eacute;eld himselfe, and to become his true subiect if he might get his pardon, and be at his owne libertie.
But being answered that he should not be receiued, vnlesse he would come vnto Dunstafage
with other of his chiefest compices, and to stand fullie at the kings mercie; he refused
thus to doo, deuising an other meane how to be reuenged.</p>
<p>Therefore to begin withall, he procured two naughtie persons to go ouer into Albaine,
<note place="marg">Donald deuiseth how to murther king Findocke by two naughtie persons.</note>
and to feine themselues to haue fled from him, where also he willed them to offer their seruice vnto the king, and to disclose vnto him certeine light secrets of the said Donalds, thereby to win credit if it might be, and in the end to espie a time to rid him out of the way.
These craftie mates working according to Donalds wicked instructions, at length with much
adoo they got credit, and after credit they got place so n&eacute;ere the king by the furtherance of
Carantius the kings brother (whome they made priaie also vnto their intent) that finding
all things correspondent vnto their purpose (one day as the king hunted) the one began
to f&eacute;ed him with a tale of the hatred which the Ilanders bare towards him, whereto he
gaue verie good care, whilest the other smote him to the heart with a iaueline, &amp; so leauing
<note place="marg">Findocke is slaine.</note>

Those that were n&eacute;ere, seeing what had happened, some of them ran to him, to s&eacute;e if they
might relieue him as then strugling with the pangs of death; others followed the murtherers,
and ouertaking them, brought them backe to receiue their meed according to that which

of the house, and thinking to saue themselues, were beaten downe in the countrie as they
passed by the people, who bare so deadlie and mortall hatred vnto the late king, that they
not onelie reioised much at his death, but thought themselues sufficientlie reuenged, when
they could kill anie that did belong vnto him.</p>

of the mind, but also by reason of his comelie personage and passing beautie, setting foorth

according to the tenor of the old league. Moreouer, when the said ambassadors should depart,
he tooke vnto them to deliuer from him as a present vnto their maister certeine horsses, with
hounds and greihounds, such as he thought that king Thelargus wanted.</p>
<p>And shortlie after the returne of these ambassadors into their countrie, diuerse yoong gentlemen of the Pictish nobilitie repaired vnto king Crathlint, to hunt and make merie with
him: but when they should depart homewards, perceiuing that the Scotish dogs did farre
excell theirs, both in fairnesse, swiftnesse, hardinesse, and also in long standing vp and holding out, they got diuerse both dogs and bitches of the best kinds for breed to be giuen then
by the Scotish lords, and yet not so contented, they stale one belonging to the king from his
k&eacute;eper, being more est&eacute;emed of him than all the other which he had about him. The
maister of the leash being informed hereof, pursued after them which had stolen that dog,
thinking in d&eacute;ed to haue taken him from them, but they not willing to depart with him, fell
at altercation, and in the end chanced to strike the maister of the leash through with their
borespeares that he died presentlie, wherevpon a noise and crie being raised in the countrie
by his seruants, diuerse of the Scots as they were going home from hunting, returned; and
falling vpon the Picts to reuenge the death of their fellow, there insued a shrewd bickering
betwixt them, so that of the Scots there died thr&eacute;escore gentlemen, besides a great number
of the commons, not one of them vnderstanding (till all was doone) what the matter ment.
Of the Picts there were about an hundred slaine.</p>
<p>The kinsmen and friends of the Scots that were thus slaine, were woonderfullie mooued
with the iniurie committed, insomuch that without commandement of king or capteine, they
assembled in great numbers togither, and entring into the Pictish confines, they began to
rob, spoile and kill after the maner of warre, wherewith the Picts being set in a rage, came
foorth togither into the field, and incountering with the Scots, there was fought a sore battell
betwixt them, without capteine, order, or standard, till at length the victorie remained with
the Picts, of whom were slaine notwithstanding the day went on their sides, about two
thousand men, but of the Scots there died aboue thr&eacute;e thousand, or more, as was supposed.
Thus vpon a light occasion was the league broken betwixt these two nations, who had continued as friends, the one still readie to aid the other, euer sith the daies of king Reutha,
being the 7 in number that reigned after Ferguse.</p>
<p>These two nations being thus fallen at debate, it was woonder to vnderstand with what
crueltie the one sought to destroie the other. No pitie might mooue their cruell harts to
spare either man, woman or child that fell into their hands: such was their inordinate and
like desire which they had to shed each others bloud. At last Thelargus K. of the Picts
being a verie aged man, and perceiuing what mischiefe was happened through the follie of a
few wilfull persons, appointed certeine of his counsell to go as ambassadors vnto king Crathlint, to find some means to haue the matter taken vp, for the auoiding of the imminent
danger that was like to insue to both nations. They according to their instructions comming
to the place where Crathlint as then soiourned, had much adoo to get licence to come vnto
his presence: but at length being admitted, they vsed such humble persuasions grounded
vpon reasonable considerations, that although no peace could be fullie concluded, yet a truce
was granted them for thr&eacute;e moneths space, which was but sorilie obserued, for deadly
hatred and inward desire of reuenge was entred so farre into the breasts of the commons
on both sides, that neither commandement nor punishment might staie them from the inuading of one anothers confines, mauger their princes and all their sore restraints.</p>
<p>In this meane time was the estate of the Romane empire in Britaine brought into trouble

he vsed to suffer those rouers to take spoiles and prises, to the end he might in their returne take the same from them againe, and conuert the gaine wholie to his owne vse, without restoring that which was due to the owners, or sending anie portion thereof to the Romane emperor, he was complained vpon, and sent for; but for that he doubted to come

<note place="marg">Carantius requireth to be aided against the Romans.</note>
to his answer, as one which knew himselfe guiltie, he furnished his nauie with men, vittels
and ordinance, and with the same tooke his course about the west parts of Britaine, and
landed in Westmerland, where he easilie procured the people there to submit themselues to
be vnder his rule and obeisance, and promised to deliuer them from the gr&eacute;euous yoke and
bondage of the Romans.</p>
<p>Thus hauing begun the foundation of that which he purposed to atchiue, for his further
aduancement therein, he sent ambassadors vnto his nephue king Crathlint, both declaring
what he was, and also excusing the trespasse surmised against him, for being of counsell
touching the murther of his brother Findocke, father to the same Crathlint: and therefore
if in putting away all mistrust of his innocencie in that behalfe, he would aid him against
the Romans, he doubted not but that he should in short time vtterlie expell them out of
all Britaine, and enioy all those prouinces within the same (which as then they possessed)
vnto his owne vse, and this he said should be more honor and gaine both to the Scotishmen &amp; Picts, if they could be contented to renew friendship, and ioine with them in aid
against their common enimies, than to s&eacute;eke to destroie one another, as he latelie vnderstood
they had doone for a dog.</p>
<p>Crathlint hearing the words of these ambassadors, reioised not a little, that his vncle
<note place="marg">Crathlist reioiseth to hear that Carantius was aline.</note>

<note place="marg">Crathlint resolueth to aid Carantius, &amp; certifieth him of the same.</note>
Carantius was not onelie aliue, but also had through his valiancie atchiued so high renowme
as to be accounted one of the worthiest warriors amongst all the Romane capteins. And
herevpon with good aduise he determined to aid him in that his enterprise for the conquest
of Britaine to the vttermost of his power. Adding further, that if it were not for the warres
which he doubted to haue with the Picts, he would not onlie send him aid of men, but
also come with them himselfe: and hereof he assured the ambassadors both by word of
mouth and letters. Who returning with such answer vnto their maister Carantius, he 
<note place="marg">The king of the Picts also promiseth to aid Carantius.</note>
reioised not a litle, to vnderstand how well they had sped, and so much the more, for that he
receiued about the same time the like answer from the king of Picts.</p>
<p>Shortlie after he came to an interuiew with the king of Scots at the water of Eske, where
<note place="marg">Grathlint king of the Scots and Carantius come to talke togither.</note>
after he had purged himselfe with manie words of excuse, touching the murther of his
brother Findocke, there was an assured friendship concluded betwixt them. And at the
motion of Carantius, Crathlint was contented to come to a communication with the king of
Picts, for the conclusion of a peace, to the intent that both of them might ioine their powers
togither, in aid of Carantius against the Romans. At this communication both the kings
<note place="marg">Crathlint and the king of the Picts come to a communication by Carantius his means, who trauelleth to set them at one.</note>
met, and Carantius likewise was there, as a man indifferent betwixt them both, to doo what
he could to linke them both in amitie. And verelie his presence therevnto stood so much
in st&eacute;ed, that chieflie through his persuasion grounded vpon great reasons and weightie considerations, they agreed to conclude a peace, and to renew the old league in such maner and
forme, and with such conditions, as should be thought requisite by the aduise and discr&eacute;et
order of eight ancient persons: foure to be chosen on the one part, and foure on the other.
Which eight persons taking the matter in hand, did so aduisedlie giue order for the 
<note place="marg">Peace confirmed againe betwixt the Scotishmen and Picts.</note>
auoiding of all causes of grudge and hatred, that both parts held them satisfied with their arbitrement
and direction, so that a ioifull peace was confirmed, and all variance vtterlie quenched.</p>
<p>In this meane time Quintus Bassianus the Romane lieutenant in Britaine, vnderstanding
how Carantius was thus reuolted, and had not onelie caused them of Westmerland to rebell,
but also slaine and chased the Romans out of that countrie, he was not a little disquieted,
and determined with all sp&eacute;ed to go against him, and to reuenge these iniuries. Within a

force thitherward, in purpose to fight with them, though he vnderstood they were in thr&eacute;e
great battels, as the Scots in one, the Picts in another, and those of Carantius retinue in the
third. He lodged that night within a verie strong place, fensed about with marishes.</p>
<p>But Carantius vnderstanding all the maner of his enimies by his espials, and being in
campe within ten miles of them or thereabout, in the same night he raised his field without
anie great brute, and by the leading of certeine guides he marched streight toward the place
where Bassianus was incamped, so that anon after the spring of the day he came thither:
whereof Bassianus being aduertised, and perceiuing he should haue battell, maketh readie for
the same, giuing the best exhortation he could vnto his people to plaie the men: but forsomuch as the most part of his armie were Britains, all his words nothing auailed: for they
desirous to s&eacute;e the vtter ruine of all the Romane power, euen at the verie point when the
<note place="marg">The Britains betray the Romans.</note>
battels should haue ioined, withdrew themselues apart without anie stroke striken, and got
them vp into the next mounteins, to see what would insue. The residue of the Romane
armie, seeing themselues thus forsaken of their fellowes, and their sides left bare and open
for the enimie to enter vpon them, fell to plaine running away, but by reason of the
<note place="marg">The Romans are disc&omacr;fited.</note>
marish ground compassing them in on each side, seruing well to purpose for the Scots,
and other the confederates, a great number of the Romans, and other of their part were
<note place="marg">The slaughter of the Romans.</note>
ouertaken and slaine. Amongst whome Bassianus himselfe was one, and Hircius the emperors procurator an other.</p>
<p>The Britains (who as is said refused to fight in the beginning of the battell) y&eacute;elded 
<note place="marg">The Britains y&eacute;eld themselues vnto Carantius.</note>
themselues vnto Carantius, and sware to be his true liege men and subiects. In like maner
Carantius appointed all such of the nobilitie as were betwixt twentie y&eacute;eres and thr&eacute;escore,
to remaine with him in hostage: but the spoile of the field he diuided amongest his people
equallie, so that as well the Scotishmen and Picts, as also his owne souldiers held them
well contented and satisfied therewith. After this victorie Carantius caused himselfe to be
<note place="marg">Carantius or Carausius, as <emph>Eutropius</emph> nameth him, vsurpeth the kingdome of Britaine.</note>
proclamed king of Britaine, vsurping the gouernment therof wholie to himselfe, and reteining two thousand of the Scots and Picts to attend vpon the safegard of his person, sent
the residue home laden with riches of the enimies spoile. He sent also with them his ambassadors, to render thanks vnto both the kings for their aid in this so prosperous a victorie,
assigning vnto them as a portion of the conquest, the countries of Westmerland and 
<note place="marg">Carantius hauing got the victorie, diuideth the gaine in assigning to his c&omacr;federats their due portions.</note>
Cumberland, with all that region which lay betwixt Adrians wall, and the citie of Yorke, to inioy
as their owne proper patrimonie for euermore. Finallie the said Carantius was slaine by his
companion Alectus, as in the English historie ye may find more at large.</p>
<p>After this, Crathlint king of Scots deliuered from troubles against the Romans, deuised
sundrie good ordinances for the quiet state of the Scotish common-wealth causing the peace
to be diligentlie obserued betwixt him and the Picts. Also in his daies the persecution of
<note place="marg">The persecution of the christians by Dioclesian.</note>
the christians chanced, which the emperour Dioclesian commanded to be executed in most
furious wise, so that there were few partes of the world (where anie christians were knowne
to inhabit) that tasted not of that his cruell ordinance and scourge in that behalfe. In
Britaine also, as well as in other places, there was no small quantitie of innocent bloud shed,
with most vnmercifull murther committed, to the great triumph of Christs crosse, that glorious
ensigne of our religion.</p>
<p>In which time Constantius Chlorus father to Constantine the great, was resident in Britaine,
who adiudging the Scots to be a people wholie giuen to pillage and sl&aacute;ughter, as they were
in d&eacute;ed, determined with himselfe to haue brought them to subiection. But yer he could
atchiue any notable enterprise, he died, leauing behind him the fame of a right gentle and
woorthie prince, sauing that in one point he sore stained his honor, for that he was one of
the chiefe that persecuted the christian flocke vnder Dioclesian, forcing no small number of

the faithfull amongst the Britains, to fl&eacute;e vnto the Scots and Picts to auoid his persecution.
Whome Crathlint receiued for his part most louinglie, and assigned vnto them (as the Scots
say) the Ile of Man for a place of habitation, destroieng all such temples of the heathens
religion belonging to the Druides, which had continued there since the begining; and vtterlie

sauiour, wherein the christians might celebrate their diuine seruice, according to their profestion. This church being richlie indowed, was the first bihops s&eacute;e amongst the Scots, and
therevpon was taken for the mother church of the realme. It is now called the church of
saint Sauiour. Finallie Crathlint departed out of this life, after he had reigned 24 y&eacute;eres,
being much praised aswell for his politike gouernement, as for his great and earnest zeale
which he bare toward the aduancement of the true christian religion.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">FINCOMARKE</hi> that was his vncles sonne, succ&eacute;eded him in the kingdome, &amp; was placed on
the stone of marble, to the great reioising of all the estates, who wished him a prosperous
reigne, and long to continue therein. There liued in king Crathlints daies a noble christian
called Amphibalus, a Britaine borne, who fl&eacute;eing from the persecution then raised in his 
<note place="marg">Amphibalus.</note>

setting foorth the word of life, and rooting out of their hearts all superstitious errors of blind

in the y&eacute;ere (as W. Harison saith) after the birth of our Sauiour 325, after the creation of the
world 4292, and from the first establishing of the Scotish kingdome 652, and in the 20 y&eacute;ere
of Constantine the emperour. It chanced that Octauius king of the Britains was vanquished
by Traherus a Romane capteine, and forced for his refuge to flee vnto this Fincomarke then
king of Scots, who receiued him as a friend. And furthermore though he were required by
Traherus to deliuer him into his hands, as a traitor and a rebell vnto the Romane empire,
yet Fincomarke refused so to doo, choosing rather to susteine all Traherus his malice, and

to haue warres with the Romane emperor, than to betray his friend who had put his life into

<p>Herewith Traherus being not a little mooued, assembled his power, and entred into Westmerland, the which countrie had remained in the Scotishmens hands euer since Carantius deliuered it ouer vnto them. Fincomarke hearing that the Romans would thus make him wars,
had likewise raised a puissant armie to resist them, so that he had at the least 60 thousand
persons togither in one armie, as 30 thousand of his owne countriemen, 20 thousand Picts,
&amp; ten thousand of such Britains as followed after Octauius. Fincomarke being thus furnished,
hasted foorth to incounter with his enimies, before they should haue time to doo any notable
damage vnto his subiects, &amp; so comming within sight of them, sent an herald vnto Traherus,
to vnderstand the cause why he thus inuaded his countrie, but receiuing fr&omacr; him an vntoward
answer, he brought forth his people into the field in order readie to giue battell, and so 
<note place="marg">Fincomarke ioineth in battell with Traherus.</note>
ioining with the enimie, there was fought a right sore and cruell conflict, which continued for a
time with vnmercifull murther and slaughter on both parts.</p>
<p>Finallie, when the Romans were at a point to haue got the vpper hand, they were suddenie
put in such feare with the sight of a number of husbandmen, who had got togither their cattell
and were driuing the same awaie, that supposing they had beene some new succors comming to
aid their enimies, they immediatlie fled vpon the same, leauing the victorie to their aduersaries:
<note place="marg">The Romans fl&eacute;e.</note>

<note place="marg">The numbers slaine.</note>
howbeit of the Scots side were slaine (as their chronicles report) fift&eacute;ene thousand men, and
on the Romane part about sixteene thousand. Traherus himselfe escaped vnto Yorke, but
hearing that Fincomarke and Octauius pursued after him, he forsooke that citie, and got him

into places of more suertie, so that when the enimies came thither, the citizens yeelded
<note place="marg">Yorke is y&eacute;elded vnto Octauius.</note>
themselues, and receiued Octauius as their prince, offering from thenceforth to be vnder his
rule and gouernement. The newes of these atchiued victories being bruted throughout the
realme, caused a great number of the nobles to come in vnto Octauius, who receiued them
<note place="marg">Octauius obteineth the rule of Britaine.</note>
most thankfullie; &amp; to conclude, wrought so by their support, that he was shortlie after restored to the gouernance of the whole realme, and established therein according to his owne
wish.</p>
<p>This doone Fincomarke returned into his countrie, as well himselfe as other of his nobles
and men of warre, being highlie rewarded for their paines and trauell susteined in that iournie. There was also promise made and confirmed by solemne oth, that the countrie of
<note place="marg">Westmerland assigned to the Scotishmen.</note>
Westmerland, with such other parts as were assigned to his predecessor king Crathlint, by
order of Carantius at the time of their ioining togither in league against the Romans, should
for euer remaine vnto Fincomarke, &amp; to his successors the Scotish kings, without anie claime
or title to be made to the same by any of the Britains: but this promise was not long kept, for
shortlie after that Octauius had once chased all the Romans foorth of the British confines, and
that Traherus was fled ouer into France, there was a councell called at Yorke, where it was not
<note place="marg">A councell kept at Yorke.</note>
onelie ordeined, that from thencefoorth there should neuer anie stranger be suffered to reigne
ouer the Britains, but also that the bounds of the realme should be extended foorth beyond the
wall made (as before is recited) by the emperor Adrian, euen vnto the old ancient bounds
and limits, expelling foorth the inhabitants of forren nations.</p>
<p>Such an immoderate lust of inlarging his dominion inflamed the hart of Octauius, that 
<note place="marg">Octauius coueteth to inlarge his dominion.</note>
neither regard of his oth, nor remembrance of benefits receiued, might staie him from s&eacute;eking

to the intent to conquer the same out of the Scotishmens hands: but being incountred with a

the same time also, Traherus returned out of France with two legions of Romans and twentie
thousand of other aids: and giuing battell vnto Octauius, he vanquished his armie, and constreined him for his refuge to fl&eacute;e vnto the mouth of Humber, where he got certeine vessels,
and sailed into Norwaie, there to saue his life, bicause that Scotland was now no sure refuge
for him. Thus was Traherus againe in possession of Britaine as lieutenant to Constantine the
emperor: but shortlie after he was by certeine conspirators in fauour of Octauius murthered,

<p>Immediatlie vpon his returne, he reconciled himselfe with Fincomarke the Scotish king, and
was contented that he should quietlie inioy the countries of Westmerland and Cumberland,
with such other territories as Carantius had granted in former time vnto Crathlint. He likewise sent vnto the king of the Picts, and concluded a friendship with him, to the intent he

might haue aid from him also, if it chanced the Romans eftsoones to inuade his countrie, as
shortlie after they did, not ceasing till they had so wearied him with continuall wars, that in
the end to be at rest (as his age and other necessities then required) he deliuered into their hands
certeine castels and fortresses, and also became tributarie to the emperor, on condition that he

quieted in Albion, the Romans, Britains, Scotishmen and Picts, continued in friendlie peace
without any notable trouble, till the ninth yeare of the reigne of Valentinian emperor of Rome:
&amp; first of Damasus the pope. In the which yeare Fincomarke king of Scots departed this
life, after he had gouerned the estate aboue 47 y&eacute;eres. This was in the y&eacute;ere of our redemption 172. This Fincomarke left behind him two sonnes, the one named Eugenius, being as
then about 18 y&eacute;eres of age; the other hight Ethodius, and was yoonger than his brother by
one y&eacute;ere, so that neither of them might succ&eacute;ed their father, by reason they were not of
y&eacute;eres sufficient to rule, according to the ancient ordinance.</p>
<p>Herevpon a councell was called in Argile, where there was hard hold betwixt the three

gouerne the land: their names were Romacus, Fethelmacus, and Angusianus. Romacus had
a Pictish ladie of the bloud roiall of that nation to his mother, and for that his father was eldest brother next vnto Crathlint, he looked to be preferred, though he himselfe was yoonger
in y&eacute;eres than either Fethelmacus or Angusianus. Fethelmacus gaue his consent with such
voices as he had vnto Angusianus, wherewith Romacus being not a little offended, sought
<note place="marg">Romacuss&eacute;eketh means to destroie his cousins.</note>
meanes to haue destroied them both: but his practise being discouered, caused manie to withdraw their good wils from him, whereby his aduersaries were the more incouraged: and therevpon the councell brake vp, either part deuising how to strengthen themselues against the others
practises. But forsomuch as Angusianus vsed plaine meanes without any fraudulent dealing,
<note place="marg">Angusianus with vpright dealing purchaseth the more friendship.</note>

<note place="marg">Romacas vanquisheth Angusianus.</note>
he got the more friends, so that Romacus was constreined in the end to reqire aid of the
king of Picts, who being n&eacute;ere of kin to him, might not denie his request. Angusianus therefore vnderstanding what danger he was in, if he fell into his aduersaries hands, got togither an
armie of such as fauoured his cause, and incountring with him in battell was put to flight, and
forced to flie into the westerne Iles with his cousine Fethelmacus, where remaining for a while,
at length he was aduertised that the inhabitants had conspired against him, for doubt whereof
he got him ouer into Ireland.</p>

part of the nobles and commons for their king. But as the accustomed maner of tyrants,
comming thus to the gouernement of a realme through euill meanes, is to rule with crueltie,
so did he behaue himselfe, according to that semblable rate, so soone as he thought himselfe
to be sure of the estate. Wherefore such as had borne any euill will to Fincomarke, and were
out of fauor in his daies, those did Romacus call vnto him, and afterward vsed their counsell
aboue all other mens, aduancing them also to most high rule and rich offices. Againe, those
which had b&eacute;ene in fauor with Fincomarke, or bare any affection toward his issue, he sought

<note place="marg">Ethodius &amp; Eugenins the sonnes of Fincomarke are conneied into the Ile of Man</note>
couertlie to bereaue them both of life, lands and goods, so that by such his dooings, there was
gathered no light suspicion, that he would likewise yer long find meanes to dispatch Ethodius
and Eugenius the sons of the same Fincomarke, thereby to be the more assured of the crowne
&amp; kingdome it selfe. The two children also fearing as much on their owne behalfe, by the
aduise and helpe of their trustie friends, conueied themselues into Westmerland, and after ouer
into the Ile of Man, where they remained looking for a daie.</p>
<p>Then began banishments, confiscations of goods, and slaughter of such as were thought to
be fauorers of Angusianus cause, without respect either of sex or age, till the nobles of the
<note place="marg">The Scotish lords conspire against Romacus.</note>
realme being not a little mooued with such his cruell dooings, and tyrannicall gouernment, conspired togither by secret meanes how to deliuer their countrie of so pernicious a tyrant. And
to bring this their purpose the more sp&eacute;edilie to passe, they wrought so closelie, that they had
assembled a great armie, and were come with the same within ten miles of the place where he
then laie, yer he had any vnderstanding of their enterprise, so that whereas he (being vnprouided of resistance) assaied by flight towards Pictland to haue escaped their hands, it preuailed
him nothing, for he was taken by the waie, and receiued such end as his former passed life
<note place="marg">Romacus apprehended and put to death.</note>
had verie well deserued, in the fourth y&eacute;ere of his reigne: his head was set vpon the end of a
pole, and carried about to be shewed vnto the people to their great reioisng. There were
slain at the same time beside him, diuers Scots &amp; Picts, of counsell with him in all his cruell
practises.</p>
<p>After which execution doone, they sent for Angusianus, who returned into Scotland, &amp;
<note place="marg">Angusianus proclamed king.</note>
was proclamed king, as well by consent of the lords, as fauour of the commons. About the
same time, bicause the Britains had slaine the Romane lieutenant, the emperor Constantius
sent one Maximus thither to chastise the rebels, with whom the same Maximus incountring
in battell, gaue them a great ouerthrow. And within three daies after Octauius king of the
Britains, through gr&eacute;efe, age, and long sicknesse, being consumed to the last point, departed

this life. He left a sonne behind him named also Octauius, who doubting to fall into the
hands of the Romans, fled into the Ile of Man, and remained there certeine y&eacute;eres vnknowne
with Eugenius and Ethodius, the sonnes of Fincomarke. The Britains also persisting in their
rebellion, were eftsoones discomfited in battell by Maximus, and sore by him persecuted, till
he had brought them againe to their full subiection.</p>
<p>While these troubles continued in Britaine, Angusianus K. of Scots was sore disquieted by
<note place="marg">Nectanus king of the Picts maketh sore warres vpon the Scots.</note>
Nectanus king of Picts, who inforced himselfe to reuenge the death of his cousine Romacus,
making sundrie rodes &amp; forraies into the Scotish confines, and greatlie indamaged the countrie, by spoiling of goods, murthering of the inhabitants, and burning of townes with villages; and in the end hauing his power increased by the aid of certeine Scotishmen, which
had borne good will vnto Romacus, he preased so sore vpon Angusianus, that he had no remedie but to trie the hazard of battell in a pitched field; for no friendlie persuasions to haue
peace or anie agr&eacute;ement could be heard, though Angusianus made humble sute to haue purchased the same. Wherefore perceiuing no hope of attonement, he prepared an armie, and
met his enimie in the field, where (after sore fight and much slaughter) the victorie remained
<note place="marg">The Picts discomfited by Scots.</note>
with Angusianus, and Nectanus with his Picts were chased and forced to saue themselues by
flight.</p>
<p>Nectanus himselfe neuer rested till he came vnto Camelon, where he caused a councell of
<note place="marg">Nectanus desirous of reuenge.</note>
his nobles to haue their aduise by what meanes he might be reuenged of the iniuries receiued
by the Scots, whereof he was most desirous, not regarding into what danger he brought his
owne realme, so he might somewhat ease his rancour and displeasure, which he had thus conceiued against his enimies the Scots. Neither wanted there diuers great personages in that
assemblie, which (to content his mind and to win fauour of him) set forward the matter
in such earnest wise that (notwithstanding what other could say to the contrarie) it was ordeined that with all sp&eacute;ed an armie should be leuied, and led foorth into the Scotish borders.
Nectanus hauing thus the consent of his nobles to inuade the Scots anew, caused men of warre
to be taken vp through all the parties of his dominion, and that of the choisest men that might
be got; the which being once assembled, he staied not long but set forward with them, and
<note place="marg">Nectanus inuadeth the Scotish confines.</note>
entred into Kalendar wood, spoiling and destroieng all afore him at his owne will and pleasure.</p>
<p>Angusianus vnderstanding his furie, and doubting least the Britains through setting on of
the Romans should s&eacute;eke to ioine with the Picts, to the destruction of the Scots, thought
good to assaie if by anie friendlie meanes he might bring Nectanus to fall vnto some reasonable point, rather than by the warres to indanger both the Pictish and Scotish estates, in putting
the same in aduenture to fall into the hands of their ancient enimies the Romans and the Britains. Herevpon therefore he wrote vnto Nectanus a gentle letter, declaring therein all such
<note place="marg">Angusianus sueth for peace.</note>
dangers and inconueniences as might insue by this warre thus by him attempted. And againe,
how necessarie it were for both the nations to haue peace togither as then, considering how it
was not to be thought that Maximus the Romane legat (hauing now all the Britains at his
commandement) would rest ( if occasion were offered) till that he had fullie subdued both the
Scots and Picts: for the auoiding of which perill he offered for his part, to accept anie reasonable conditions of peace, that should by him be prescribed.</p>
<p>But Nectanus in no wise would giue eare to anie treatie of peace, so that Angusianus being
<note place="marg">Nectanus refuseth all offers of peace.</note>
forced to giue battell for defense of his subiects, brought his people into the field, and exhorting them to plaie the men with sundrie comfortable woords, he placed them in order of
battell. On the other part Nectanus likewise incouraged his folkes to doo valiantlie, so that
<note place="marg">Angusianus and Nectanus ioine in battell with their armies.</note>
the archers on both sides stepped forward, letting their arrowes flie fr&eacute;elie one at an other,
vntill at length comming to handblowes they stroke on freshlie, beating downe and killing
without sparing on either side, so that a good space the victorie was doubtfull. At length
Angusianus perceiuing his people to be put to the woorst, rushed foorth into the thickest of
the presse amongst his enimies, where he was quicklie espied, oppressed with prease, and
<note place="marg">Angusianus is slaine.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots are discomfited.</note>
slaine out of hand. The most part of his people missing him, &amp; notunderstanding what was
become of him, supposed that he had b&eacute;ene fled, and therefore fell also to running away;

but the residue that stood still at their defense were slaine downe right. Thus the victorie
remained with the Picts, but neither part had anie cause to reioise, for the capteins on both
sides were slaine, besides manic thousands of other so that aswell the one nation as the other
<note place="marg">Nectanus is also slaine.</note>
departed from the place right pensife and sorrowfull; giuing manie a sore cursse vnto such as
had b&eacute;ene the procurers and nourishers of such detestable hatred betwixt those two nations,
which had so long a time beene conioined in the faithfull band of amitie, to the great quiet
and wealth of both the countries. After this bloudie battell, aswell the Scots as Picts sat still
for a season, not attempting anie enterprise of importance the one against the other.</p>
</div>
<div n="Fethelmacus" type="section">
<head>FETHELMACUS.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">ANGUSIANUS</hi> reigned not past two yeares before he was slaine thus in the field, as before
ye haue heard, in whose place succeded his cousine Fethelmacus with little better successe: for in the second yeare of his reigne, desirous to be reuenged of the Picts, he assembled an armie, and entring into Angus, began to spoile &amp; slea downe right all that was before
him, without regard to impotent, aged, tender infants, or other. The Picts also being kindled herewith, gathered their power togither, and incountring with the Scots, there was a
<note place="marg">The Scots discomfit the Picts.</note>
sore bettell fought betwixt them: but the Scots first putting the wings of their enimies host
to flight, at length discomfited their maine battell also, being left naked on both sides of all
aid or succour, great slaughter was made in the chase of the Picts as they fled hither and thither to saue themselues. So that among other, their king named Nectanus, brother to the
<note place="marg">An other Nectanus king of the Picts dieth of hurts receiued in the fight with the Scots.</note>
aboue remembred Nectanus, being wounded with an arrow, died within thr&eacute;e dates after this
cruell conflict was ended. The courage of the Scots now being aduanced with this their
prosperous successe, they passed forthwith ouer the riuer of Taie, to rob harrie, and spoile the
countrie of Fife.</p>
<p>The Picts, perceining themselues not to be strong inough to match with their enimies
in plaine field at hand-strokes, determined yet with skirmishes and light incounterings (if it
were possible) to k&eacute;epe them off from the winning of anic of their fensed townes, castels or
strong holds. And to be the more able to mainteine themselues in this their purposed intention, they did choose on Heirgust to their king, a man of subtill nature and craftie 
<note place="marg">Heirgust is chosen king of the Picts.</note>
imagination. This Heirgust deuising how to deliuer his countrie of such an intollerable enimie as
Fethelmacus was, procured two slie fellowes Picts by nation, to counterfelt themselues for
<note place="marg">A pretended treason.</note>
Scots, and for that they were cunning throwers of the dart, in which kind of exercise the same
Fethelmacus tooke great pleasure, they were appointed to make sute to be in seruice with him,
to the intent that when they might espie their time, they should slea him, by one kind of
meane or other.</p>
<p>They (according as they were instructed, comming into Scotland) found meanes not onelie
to haue place in the kings house, but also to corrupt one of his musicians an harper, and t&oacute;
bring him to be of counsell with them in this their wicked purpose. By reason whereof, in
one night as he laie at Carrike, where he was busie to make his prouision there for the warres
against the Picts, the same musician (hauing plaid in the kings bed-chamber till he had
brought him asl&eacute;epe) did let in those two Pictish traitors, who foorrhwith slue him euen as he

being taken, and confessing the d&eacute;ed, with the whole maner of the same, they were drawen
in p&eacute;eces with wild horsses: the musician also being apprehended and conuict of the treason,
suffered semblablie the like kind of death. Fethelmacus came to his end in the third yeare

waies he might best subdue both those nations, thereby not onelie to inlarge the bounds of
the Romane empire, and to deliuer the Britains from inuasions of those so cruell enimies, but
also to haue the south part of the lie more obedient and loiall vnto the same empire than

therein the Scots not onelie adiudged for common enimies, both to the Romans and Britains,
but also to the Picts. And further therewith were certeine orders appointed how the war

Eugenius, assembled with all speed a strong &amp; mightie armie of Romans, Britains, and
Frenchmen, with the which entring into Westmerland, he spoiled that countrie most miserablie, taking diuers castels and strong holds by force, the which he furnished with garrisons
of his people, and then passing into Anandale, burned and harried the same; from thence
he entred into Galloway, omitting no kind of tyrannie that might be shewed against the

of battell, and so ioining with his enimies n&eacute;ere vnto the water of Cr&eacute;e, his people were
quicklie put to flight, and chased, by reason that they were much inferior in number. But
the Romans pursuing the chase, happened to light amongest them of Argile, which had
not b&eacute;ene at the battell, but were comming towards it, and now fiercelie incountring with
such as pursued their friends, they caused them to retire backe with some losse, whervpon
the other Scots also (which were chased) returned, &amp; gaue a fresh onset, so that if night had
not come on the sooner, there had b&eacute;ene a far greater multitude of the Romans slaine in
that bickering than they themselues did thinke of. Herevpon the Romans, doubting what
their enimies intended to doo, they fortified their campe that night verie stronglie; but
<note place="marg">Eugenius breaketh vp his armie.</note>
Eugenius vnderstanding what a multitude of his folks were slaine in the battell, so that the

<p>Which being doone, he himselfe repaired the same night vnto Carrike, where he remained

had placed in their countries, by reason whereof sundrie bickerings happened betwixt them
of the same garrisons and the Scots, who laboured not onelie to deliuer their owne countrie

the meane time vnderstanding the comming of his enimies, mustered his people, and appointed the assemblie to be made in the countrie of Kile, which way he heard that his enimies
would trauell. Thither came also not onlie all the able men of the Scotish domninions, but

persons right fierce and hardie, desirous either to vanquish the enimie with dint of sword,
or else to die presentlie in the place.</p>
<p>Maximus hearing that the Scots were thus incamped in Kile, marched towards them, and
<note place="marg">The approch of Maximus towards the Scots.</note>
lodged the same night not far off from the riuer of Munda, where knowledge was giuen
vnto Eugenius, that Maximus was come within fiue miles of him, with a greater armie than
he had at his last incountring with him in Galloway. These aduertisements caused no
small stir to be raised in the campe, some being striken with present feare: where other
contrariwise moued with high indignation, desired nothing so much as to ioine in battell
with the Romans, whose cruell tyrannie they much detested. Eugenius himselfe shewed
<note place="marg">Engenius comforteth his people.</note>
no countenance of feare at all, but incouraging his people with comfortable words, he
brought them streight in order of battell, diuided into thr&eacute;e wards, committing one of them
to the leading of his brother Ethodius, the second to Doalus the gouernour of Argile, &amp; reseruing the third to himselfe. This doone, he made vnto them a pithie oration, declaring
how necessarie it was for them to plaie the men, considering that in victorie consisted the
onelie hope of libertie; and in being vanquished, their countrie was indangered to be brought
into perpetuall bondage for euer, for the onelie marke which the Romans shot at, was to
oppresse the libertie of the whole Iland, and to reduce the same into the forme of a prouince, to be gouerned at the will of the victorers, to the breach of all their old ancient lawes
&amp; long continued customs.</p>
<p>With these and manie other like reasons he went about to incourage the minds of his
subiects, in such wise, that in maner the most part of them determined rather to die with
honor, than to liue in such miserie as they feared would insue, if the victorie shuld rest vpon
the Romans side. And as they were in such talke togither, suddenlie commeth in one of
<note place="marg">The sudden arriuall of Maximus.</note>
their scouts with the newes, that Maximus with his armie was euen at hand. This was in
the morning, anon after the sunne was vp, where he was not looked for till the euening
following, insomuch that the same his sudden arriuall, chancing so farre contrarie to their
former expectations, troubled all their heads, and brought them into a great maze, for that
hereby they were constreined to change the order of their battels to haue the sunne on their
backs, as they had prouided at the first it should haue b&eacute;ene, if the enimies had not come
vntill the after none. Yet notwithstanding, they had no sooner changed their place, and
gotten themselues into arraie of battell againe, but that with great violence they preassed
forward to giue the onset vpon the Romans. Which Maximus perceiuing, made all the
<note place="marg">The Scots giue the onset.</note>
sp&eacute;ed he could to set his men in order of battell, that he might receiue his enimies comming
thus to incounter him. So both sides beeing fullie bent to battell, and approched within
danger of shot, they let fl&eacute;e the same most egerlie, albeit that through hasting foorth to ioine
<note place="marg">The battels ioine.</note>
at hand-strokes, there was litle hurt doone with bowes or darts.</p>
<p>The Scots crieng vpon the name of their woorthie and famous ancestor king Gald, did
laie about them, most fiercelie, after they came once to the ioining: and likewise the Romans, being incouraged with the cheerefull words of the lieutenant Maximus, boldlie incountered them, so that it was doubtfull at the first whether part should haue the woorse end
<note place="marg">Doubtfull fight.</note>
of the staffe. But shortlie there followed variable successe, for on the one part, they of
Rosse and Mar, being appointed vnder Ethodius to incounter that wing of the enimies
where the Picts were, fought so egerlie and with such fierce wils, that they easilie put the

<note place="marg">The Scots hauing vanquished the Picts, are slaine by the Romans.</note>
Picts vnto flight, bearing downe a great number of them as they would haue passed the
water of Dune, but streightwaies after falling to the spoile, they were slaine downe right,
by a legion of such Romans as were sent by Maximus vnto the succours of the Picts.</p>
<p>On the other side, in the left wing those of Argile, Cantire, Kile, and Coningham, who
were matched with the Britains, Frenchmen, and Germans, after long and cruell fight were
there slaine in the place, greatlie to their fame and glorie for euer, so that by this meanes
the maine battell of the Scotishmen, wherein Euganius himselfe stood amongst his people,
was left bare &amp; naked on both the sides. Which Maximus perceiuing, he caused the same

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"115"</fw>-->

to be assailed on each part with such violence, that in the end longer resistance preuailed not,
<note place="marg">The Scotish battell is ouerthrowne.</note>

<note place="marg">Eugenius is slaine.</note>
but that their maine battell must n&eacute;edes be opened perforce, by meanes whereof Eugenius
choosing rather to die in the place, than either to saue his life by flight, or by rendering
himself into his enimies hands to liue in miserie, &amp;c: was there slaine, togither with a
great number of his nobles and gentlemen, hauing determined by the example of their
maister to die rather sp&eacute;edilie with honor, than longer to liue with shame and reproch.
Thus Eugenius lost his life with his kingdome, in the third y&eacute;ere after his first entering to
the rule, hauing inioied few good daies in rest during the said time.</p>
<p>Such of the Scots also as were appointed to k&eacute;epe the cariage and trusse of the field,
<note place="marg">The furious rage of the Scotish carters.</note>
s&eacute;eing their lords and maisters thus slaine, rushed foorth with such weapons as they had
at hand, in purpose to slea some number of their enimies, not passing though it should
cost them also their owne liues, so that they might die reuenged. The slaughter was great
which at the first was made, more through an obstinate desire of reuenge, than by anie valiant
actiuitie: but this companie being anon broken in sunder, and driuen backe, they were
finallie slaine &amp; beaten downe. Moreouer, the Romans that pursued in chase after their
enimies, when the battell was doone, encountered with great numbers of such women and
aged persons as followed a farre off, to vnderstand the successe of the field, doubting what
hap might fall to their children and kinsfolks, whose slaughter when they perceiued, like
people enraged they flue vpon such Romans as they met with; but being easilie vanquished,
and refusing to fl&eacute;e, they were also slaine and cut in p&eacute;eces in a most miserable maner.</p>
<p>The Romans hauing thus rid the fields of all kind of enimies, lodged that night abroad
here and there at their pleasure, where they might heare the dolefull gronings, and lamentable complaints of them that lay wounded, and as yet not dead, cursing most bitterlie the
cruell tyrannie and couetous ambition of the Romans, with that most detestable disloialtie of
the Picts, procuring this murther and destruction of those people that had deserued farre
otherwise at their hands. When the morning was come, &amp; the light appeared, Maximus
the lieutenant caused the spoile of the dead bodies to be gathered, &amp; equallie diuided
<note place="marg">The spoile diuided amongst the souldiers.</note>
amongst his men of warre. And such as were found sore wounded and not dead, to shew
some token of clemencie, according to the old accustomed maner of the ancient Romans,
he commanded surgeans to s&eacute;e to the cure of them. The other being dead, he suffered to
<note place="marg">The buriall of the dead bodies by appointment of Maximus.</note>
be buried, causing the corps of Eugenius himselfe to be interred in most solemne and pompous sort, after the vasage of the Romane princes.</p>
<p>His brother Ethodius being found mangled in most pitifull wise, and in maner halfe dead,
<note place="marg">Ethodius sore wounded, is committed to the cure of surgeans.</note>
was also taken vp by commandement of the same Maximus, and surgeans charged to haue
the ordering of him, and to shew their diligence for the cure of his hurts in most speedie
and gentle wise. The victorie thus atchiued, Maximus surueieth the countries of Kile,
Carrike, and Coningham, with that also of Calidone, and seizeth the same into his hands,
suffering the inhabitants to inioy both goods and lands in peace and quietnesse vpon their
othes of allegiance, without anie further molestation. Heirgust king of the Picts with other
<note place="marg">Heirgust desireth the vtter destruction of the Scots.</note>
the nobles of that nation, were nothing contented ther with, desirous to s&eacute;e the vtter destruction of all the Scotish race. Wherevnto Maximus at the first would not agree, alledging
the ancient custome of the Romans, who sought rather to vanquish by benefits, than by the
sword, ouer vsing to spare such as submitted themselues, and in no wise to spot the honour
or maiestie of their empire with crueltie.</p>
<p>But the Picts not satisfied herewith, went about earnestlie to persuade him in no condition
<note place="marg">The earnest sute of the Picts to haue the Scotishmen banished and expelled out of the countrie.</note>

namelie of the Picts, vnto whose confusion (as the prophesies spake) they were begotten
and borne. Finallie when all their earnest sute missed the wished effect, they fell to and
assaied if they might bring that to passe by wicked m&eacute;ed and thorough corrupting bribes,
the which they could not doo by other meanes. And euen as it oftentimes chanceth in such

<note place="marg">Where words faile, gifts preuaile.</note>

<note place="marg">The proclamation for the auoidinig of all Scotishmen foorth of the whole Iland of Britaine.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots plagued for their beastlie crueltie.</note>
here, for at length a proclamation came foorth by procurement of the Picts, that all such
as were naturall Scotishmen, should by a certeine dale auoid out of those countries that
they possessed in Britain, vpon paine of losing life and goods, &amp; to deliuer vp their houses
and lands vnto such Britains and Picts as were appointed by the Romans for to inioy the
same.</p>
<p>The Scots perceiuing themselues not able to make anie resistance, obeied this commandement, some of them passing ouer into Ireland, some into the westerne lies; and some of
them got ouer also into Norwaie, and Denmarke, and manic there were that got interteinment amongst the Romane souldiers, and went ouer with them into France, as yet Gallia,
to serue in the warres there, and in other places vnder the emperors ensigns. The Picts
<note place="marg">The cruell dealing of the Picts.</note>
were so cruell and diligent to s&eacute;e all the Scotish linage confined, that they would not consent that a certeine number of gentlewomen should remaine behind, who had their husbands
slaine in the last warres, and made intercession in most lamentable wise vnto Maximus, that
they might be permitted to abide in their natiue countrie all the residue of their liues, though
in seruile estate, to the end that they might be buried after the same were once ended in
graues with their slaine husbands.</p>
<p>Moreouer, where Cartandis qu&eacute;ene of the Scots, late wife vnto Eugenius, was brought
<note place="marg">Cartandis qu&eacute;ene of Scots.</note>
vnto Maximus, with two gentlewomen and a groome from the toome of hir husband, where
she had remained euer sith his buriall in continuall mourning, forsomuch as she was a Britain, and descended by linage from the princes of Wales; Maximus lamenting hir miserable
case, assigned the citie of Carrike vnto hir, with certeine other reuenues for the maintenance
of hir estate. But after she had taken leaue of such as had the conduction of hir, and
was come into a village not farre from Carrike aforesaid, it chanced that a sort of Pictish
riders, or (as I may call them) robbers, met with hir, small to hir profit, and lesse to their
owne ease, for they did not onelie slea hir groome, but also beat hir gentlewomen, and
stripped both them and hir of all that they had, whereof Maximus being informed, caused
them that had doone so vile a deed to be apprehended &amp; executed by death, according as
they had deserued. The qu&eacute;ene hirselfe being brought backe vnto Maximus, and honorablie intreated, had all hir substance restored vnto hir againe, so n&eacute;ere as it was possible.</p>
<p>But the Picts being offended herewith, and speciallie for putting to death of their men,
<note place="marg">The Picts of fended with Maximus.</note>
sundrie of their nobilitie came vnto Maximus, and began to make a sore complaint in that
behalfe, declaring that the deserts of their nation had not beene such toward the Romane
empire, as to haue their people put to execution for a womans sake, being both an enimie
and a prisoner, therefore they required that she might be confined into Britaine, and according
to the tenor of the proscription, spoiled of all hir goods. Here Cartandis being present
<note place="marg">Cartandis lamenteth hir infortunate estate.</note>
hir selfe, began to make pitifull lamentation, bewailing hir most vnhappie state, in that contrarie to the order of hir wretched case and present miserable fortune,' she should now be
forced to turne againe into hir countrie: wishing rather than she should be inforced so to
doo, that she might offer vp hir life as a sacrifice in the place of hir husbands buriall: and
therefore holding vp hir hands vnto Maximus in most pitifull wise, she besought him instantlie,
that it might please him, either to suffer hir to passe the residue of hir life after such sort as
she thought best agr&eacute;ed with hir widowlike estate, or else to take the same from hir presentlie by some violent meanes of execution.</p>
<p>There was not a man other than the Picts, that saw and heard hir at that instant, but
lamented hir wofull distresse, so that in the end the request of the Picts was disallowed, &amp;
Cartandis hauing lining assigned hir for the maintenance of hir degr&eacute;e, was licenced to depart
into what place she thought expedient, there to liue as she thought best without let or
disturbance. The same time the Scotish bishops and pr&eacute;ests, being banished as well as the
other sort of the Scorish people, a number of their moonks got them into the Ile of lona,
<note place="marg">The monasterie of lona builded by banished Scotish moonks.</note>
now called Colmekill, where they erected a monasterie for their owne habitation, the

birth of our sauior 352, from the beginning of the Scotish kingdome 679, and the third y&eacute;ere
of Magnentius. The same y&eacute;ere before Eugenius gaue battell vnto Maximus, manie strange
sights were s&eacute;ene in the furthest part of Albion, striking a woonderfull dread in manie mens
harts. In the night season in the airo were s&eacute;ene fietie swords and other weapons moouing
in a long ranke, after comming togither on a heape, and being changed into an huge flame
as it had b&eacute;en a firebrand, it then vanished awaie. The waters of the riuer of Dune ran with
blood, the banks of the same riuer flashed oft times as they had b&eacute;ene all on a fire. There were
seene also a number of small birds fall out of the aire so thicke, that it s&eacute;emed it had rained
birds, and incontinentlie came a great number of rauens that deuoured vp the same.</p>
<p>Certeine witches and soothsaiers, declaring that these things berokened the destruction of
the Scotish kingdome, were commanded by the pr&eacute;ests to hold their peace on paine of death,
as they that told nothing but lies &amp; fables, though afterwards their tales prooued most true.
But to returne to our historie, Ethodius the brother of Eugenius being cured (as is said) by
<note place="marg">Ethodius confined into Denmarke.</note>
commandement of Maximus, was yet banished amongst the residue, and constreined to take
an oth, that he should immediatlie repaire into Denmarke, and hereafter not to approch neerer
vnto the coasts of Albion, for doubt of some new attempt that might be made by the Scots
thorough his meanes, thereby to returne into their countrie againe, &amp; to recouer their former state. But this staied not them of the westerne lies, but that assembling themselues togither, and choosing one Gillo to their capteine, they passed ouer into Argile, where in the end
<note place="marg">Gillo chosen capteine of the banished Scots in the western Iles comming into Argile is vanquished by the Picts.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots repaire into Ireland.</note>
they were incountred by such Picts as were set there to defend that countrie, and slaine each
mothers sonne. Their vessels were also taken and brought into sundrie hauens of the countrie, to serue for defense of the coasts vpon anie new enterprise which the Scots should chance
to make: but the other Scots, perceiuing they were not able to furnish forth a new armie in
the Iles by any aid they might purchase there, sailed ouer into Ireland, where presenting themselues vnto the king of that region, they declared vnto him from point to point all their infortunate chances and lamentable calamities, which were happened vnto them of late through
the tyrannicall puissance of the Romans, and malicious enuie of the Picts, in such sort as nothing could be more miserable than their present estate, considering the ruine of so mightie
a kingdome, and the finall banishment of the inhabitants from their houses and lands, which
had b&eacute;ene in possession of them and their elders, by the space almost of seuen hundred
y&eacute;eres.</p>

verie neere, considering they were descended both of one progenie, comforted these Scotishmen to the best of their power, and in the end concluded to aid them with ten thousand men,
and to furnish them foorth with ships, vittels, and munitions to passe into Albanie for recouerie of their countrie. This aid being put in a readiness, and the ships rigged and decked as was
<note place="marg">The Scots and Irishmen land in Cantire.</note>

<note place="marg">The Picts incounter with the Scots and Irishmen and are discomfited.</note>
requisite for such an enterprise, they tooke the sea, and landing in Cantire, chanced to meet
with Hcirdorstane brother to Heirgust king of the Picts, accompanied with a great number of
Picts and Britains assembled to defend the countrie, but being sharpelie assailed of the Scots
and Irishmen, they were quicklie put to flight, &amp; such as were ouertaken died on the sword,
to the great terror of all the new inhabitants that were planted on their parts.</p>
<p>This victorie thus atchiued, there were that gaue counsell not to attempt fortune ouer farre,
but to take such booties of goods and prisoners as they had got in the countrie, and to returne
therewith into Ireland. Other were of a contrarie opinion, supposing it best to follow the
victorie, and either to recouer againe their ancient seats, or else to die in the valiant attempt
thereof. Which aduise was followed as the best, though it prooued otherwise: for before

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"they"</fw>-->

<pb n="118"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"118"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

they could come to any conclusion of that enterprise, the Romans, Picts, and Britains gathered themselues togither, and gaue battell againe to the Scotish and Irish companie, wherein
<note place="marg">The Scots and Irishmen are ouerthrowne.</note>

they ouerthrew them, to their vtter ruine and destruction.</p>
<p>The newes of this infortunate incounter being brought into Ireland, put the king and his
nobles there in such feare of the Romans, that they thought it best with all sp&eacute;ed to send ambassadors vnto Maximus to sue vnto him for peace. They that were sent at the first were
sore blamed and checked by Maximus, for that they had aided the Scotishmen in the last inuasion made into Albion: but at length accepting their excuse, he granted a peace vpon certeine conditions, whereof the most princiall article was, that in no wise they should receiue
aid or succor any enimie to the Romane empire. This Maximus, hauing got a quiet peace
on each side, vsed all means possible how to procure the loue of his souldiors and men of
war, shewing himselfe not onelie gentle, courteous and mecke towards them, but also so liberall and fr&eacute;e, that his bounteous gifts passed all vnderstanding : insomuch that (as is reported
by writers) he bestowed in one daie neere hand as much in rewards, as the reuenues of Britaine yeelded to the empire in a whole y&eacute;ere.</p>
<p>This franke liberalitie and courteous behauior he vsed not onelie towards the Romans, and
his other men of warre, but also towards the Britains and Picts, conforming himselfe so n&eacute;ere
vnto their maners &amp; fashions, that at his comming into Pictland, he laid awaie his Romane apparell, and araied himselfe in garments after the Pictish guise. By this maner of meanes
therefore he wan him such loue and fauor, as well amongst his souldiors, as also amongst the
Picts and Britains, that in the end by common consent they chose him for emperor, in the
<note place="marg">Maximus is chosen emperor in Britaine.</note>
383 yeere after Christ, protesting generallie, that they would owe onelie their obeisance vnto him
as to their supreme gouernor. &para; Here the Scotish chronicles somwhat varie from other writers,
who affirme that Maximus was thus aduanced to the imperiall dignitie, rather by constraint
of his men of warre, than by anie meanes which he of himselfe vsed to atteine vnto the
same. Where the said chronicles neuerthelesse shew, that it came chieflie to passe by his
owne seeking, procuring certeine persons to woorke for him as instruments to frame other
to this his purposed intent. He held the dominion of the empire being thus preferred to the
<note place="marg">Maximus ruled the estate of Britaine 17 y&eacute;eres.</note>
imperiall state, the space of fiue y&eacute;eres, all the countries and people of Albion being at his
commandement without contradiction: which had not chanced vnto anie one man before his
time, since the Ile was first inhabited. At length desirous of more empire, he passed ouer into
France with a great armie, in purpose to subdue all France and Italie, with such other countries as were obedient vnto Gratian as then emperor of Rome. But how prosperouslie he
<note place="marg">The emperor Gratian is slaine by Maximus.</note>
sped in the beginning, and how at length he was slaine at Aquilia in Italie, ye shall find
in the historie of England a great deale more at large.</p>
<p>By reason of such trouble in the estate of the Romane empire, Octauius the sonne of Octauius late king of the Britains, the which (as before is said) fled into the Ile of Man, &amp; after departing from thence, got ouer into France, returned now into Britaine, and did so much there,
that the Britains receiued him to their king: but shortlie after he was constreined to agr&eacute;e
with the Romane emperor Theodosius, so that the Britains should paie their woonted tribute,
and liue vnder such lawes as by the emperor should be to them prescribed. In all other respects, Octauius should be reputed during his life for king. Immediatlie h&eacute;erevpon two lieutenants were sent from Theodosius, of whome the one named Martius soiorned at London, and
the other called Victorine at Yorke. And with all expedition they began to put the Romane
lawes in practise, abolishing the old British lawes, to the great offense of manie that could not
well brooke strange ordinances; &amp; namelie the Picts repined sore therat, and vsed most an end
their owne lawes and constitutions, greatlie to the contempt of the Romane estate. Whereof
Victorine, the one of the Romane lieutenants hauing knowledge, gaue streight commandement vnto Heirgust the Pictish king, that in no wise he should suffer the old lawes and rude
ordinances of his countrie, to be vsed anie longer amongst his subiects, vpon paine that might
insue for disobedience shewed towards the maiestie of the Romane empire.</p>

<p>Heirgust now perceiuing into what thraidome and miserie his countrie was brought, by meanes
of the warres which he had procured against his neighbours the Scotishmen, as a man sore repenting his passed follie, and s&eacute;eing no readie meane present how to reforme the same, being
aged and sore broken with continuall sicknesse, he got himselfe secretlie into his priuie chamber,
where immediatlie he slue himselfe, to be rid of the sight of that present seruile estate, into the
<note place="marg">Heirgust slaieth himselfe.</note>
which he saw both him and his whole countrie reduced. Whose death being once knowne,
Victorine commanded that the Picts should not choose anie other from thencefoorth to reigne
<note place="marg">The Picts are forbidden to create a king.</note>
as king ouer them, nor to obeie anie other magistrates but onlie such as should be appointed
to haue the gouernment of them, by commandement and commission of the Romane emperor.
For it was agr&eacute;ed, as he alledged, by the tenor of the league, concluded betwixt Heirgust and
Maximus, that after the deceasse of the same Heirgust, all his dominions should be gouerned
by Romane officers in forme of a prouince. Howbeit the Picts nothing regarded the woords of
Victorine, but by common agreement did choose one Durstus the second sonne of Heirgust to
<note place="marg">Durstus is chosen king of the Picts.</note>
be their king.</p>
<p>Wherevpon Victorine being informed of their dooings, raised a power, and made such sp&eacute;ed
towards them, that he was gotten so neere vnto the citie of Cameion, yer they had anie knowledge
of his approch, that Durstus with other of the nobles, being as then within the same, could not
<note place="marg">Durstus is besieged of the Romans.</note>
haue space to escape their waies, but being foorthwith besieged within it, at length they were
taken by force of assalt, and the citie sacked, to the great inriching of the Romane armie, and

Camelon. Thus was that tumult appeased, and the Picts commanded to paie yearlie vnto the
<note place="marg">The Picts become tributaries.</note>

<note place="marg">They are put to their base seruices.</note>
emperors procurator the fourth part of all their reuenues growing of their corne and cattell.
Beside this tribute he charged them also with diuerse base seruices, as to labor in mettall mines,
to dig stones foorth of the quarries, and to make bricke to be sent into Britaine, or into other
places whither it pleased him to command it.</p>
<p>The cause why he burdened them in such sort, was (as he said) to teach them to know
themselues. For they were become so loftie, since the departure of the Scotishmen out of
the lie, that if they were not restreined in time by authoritie of the Romane puissance, the
whole British nation were like to be shordie disquieted by their willfull meanes and insolent
presumptions. Neither was it thought sufficient vnto Victorine, to charge the Picts in maner
<note place="marg">The Picts are commanded to dwell beyond the water of Forth.</note>
as is before specified; but to their further gr&eacute;euance he deuised an other waie, whereby to
bring them in the end vnto vtter destruction, which was this: he constreined them togither
with their wines, children, &amp; whole families, to remooue beyond the water of Forth, and to
leaue all the countries on this side the same water, as well those which they ancientlie had inhabited, as the other which of late apperteined to the Scots, and were assigned to them by
Maximus to possesse after that the Scots were expelled.</p>
<p>All which countries thus by the Picts now left void, were appointed by Victorine to the Britains, as subiects to the empire, to be inhabited. And for a perfect diuision betwixt thePicts
and the same Britains, he commanded a wall to be made, &amp; a trench to be cast alongst by the
<note place="marg">A wall made to diuide the Britains from the Picts.</note>

<note place="marg">The Picts forbidden to passe ouer beyond that wall.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots liue in other countries.</note>
same, from Abircorne, through the territorie of Glascow vnto Alcluth, or Aldcluch, now
called Dunbreton, so running from the east sea to the west. H&eacute;ereto proclamation was made,
that if anie of the Pictish nation did enterprise to passe this wall, and to enter into the British
confines without licence of the magistrats, he should die for it. Whilest the Picts through
their owne fault are thus brought into most miserable subiection of the Romans, the Scotishmen (as is said) being banished the land, liued in other countries by shifting out the time so
well as they might, some continuing with their wiues and children, got a poore liuing with their
hands, exercising some science or occupation. Other there were that followed the warres,

fathers deceasse had issue by his wife called Rocha (a ladie of high parentage amongst the
nobles of Denmarke, as daughter to one Rorichus, second person of the realme) a sonne
named Ferguse, whose chance was afterwards to restore the Scotish nation againe to their former estate and kingdome. In his yoong y&eacute;eres he was appointed to serue vnder Alarike the
Gottish king in that famous voiage which he tooke in hand against the Romane empire.
<note place="marg">The Gotthes make an expedition against the empire of Rome.</note>
For such was the hate as then of all the northerne regions &amp; kingdoms towards the Romane
name, that by generall agr&eacute;ement they conspired together to the vtter ruine and finall destruction thereof. And so ech of them sent foorth a power in aid of the said Alarike, chosen
by common consent as generall of the whole enterprise.</p>
<p>Ferguse being set foorth by the king of Denmarke with a power of Danes, and with a
<note place="marg">Ferguse was sent to aid the Gotthes.</note>
chosen number of such Scotishmen as were withdrawne into those parties, went with the better will, for that beside the common quarell, he bare a priuate grudge towards the Romans for
the vsing of his ancestors so cruellie in expelling them out of their owne homes and natiue
countrie. This Ferguse was present with the Gotthes at the winning of Rome, in the sacking
whereof, amongst other spoiles, he got (as is reported) a certeine chest full of bookes, the
<note place="marg">Rome sacked.</note>
which some hold opinion he brought afterwards into the westerne lies, and caused them to be
kept in Iona, now Colmekill, within a librarie there builded for the same intent. Which bookes
(as is to be supposed) were certeine histories or monuments of old antiquities. But the same
were so defaced in the daies of Hector Boetius (who, as he himselfe writeth, caused them to be
brought ouer to him to Aberdine) that it could not be vnderstood of what matter they intreated.</p>
<p>It is written moreouer of Ferguse, that he continued with Alarike in all his enterprises, so
<note place="marg">Ferguse was a capteine vnder Alarike and Athaulfe kings of the Gotthes.</note>

<note place="marg">Ferguse with leaue returned againe from Italie into Denmarke.</note>
long as he liued, and afterwards serued vnder his successor Athaulrus, to his great fame, and in
such honorable estimation, as few were found comparable vnto him in those daies. At length
requiring a safe conduct to returne into Denmarke, he was licenced to depart with high and
right bountifull rewards, as in part of recompense of his good and faithfull seruice shewed,
during the time of the warres, as well in the life time of the said Athaulfus, as also in the
daies of his predecessor the foresaid Alarike. &para; About the same season, the bishops s&eacute;e of Candida casa, otherwise called Quhitterne, was first instituted by one Ninian a preacher, that
<note place="marg">S. Ninian.</note>
tooke great paines (as the report hath gone) to instruct the Picts and Britains in the christian
faith. He was afterwards reputed a saint, and the place of his buriall had in such veneration,
that manie vsed to resort thither for deuotion sake as the manner in times past was when pilgrimage-goings were vsed.</p>
<p>But now to returne where we left touching the Picts, and to shew the maner how the Scots returned againe into Albanie; ye shall vnderstand, that the Picts being brought into seruile bondage (as before we haue partlie declared) and doubting dailie of woorse to insue, they sent secret messsengers vnto such Scots as remained in exile in the westerne lies, in Norwaie, and in
<note place="marg">The Picts sent into forren conntries to call home the Scots.</note>
other parts of the world, promising them, if they would giue the attempt for recouerie of their
ancient dwelling places in Albanie, they should be sure of all the aid that in them laie, being
readie to spend their liues to reuenge the iniuries which they dailie susteined at the Romans
hands, whose continuall practise euer was, how to oppresse the ancient liberties of all such
nations as came vnder their subiection. The experience whereof they now felt to their vnsufferable gr&eacute;euance, looking for nothing else but shortlie to be expelled out of their countrie,
and driuen to go s&eacute;eke them other places to inhabit in strange countries after the maner of outlawes, as it had chanced alreadie to the Scots by commandement of Maximus, as before is
expressed.</p>
<p>Ferguse, vnto whom amongest other this message was chieflie directed, reioised greatlie of the
<note place="marg">Ferguse sent vnto the Scots dispersed.</note>
newes; and first conferrring with the king of Denmarke, of whose aid he knew himselfe assured, by his aduise he sent letters abroad forthwith into Norwaie, Orknie, the westerne lies,

and into Ireland, vnto such of the Scotishmen as dwelt in those places, to vnderstand their minds
herein. And being certified that they were vniuersallie agr&eacute;ed, not onelie to trie their chance
<note place="marg">Ferguse prepared himselfe to warre.</note>
for recouerie of their former state and kingdome; but also had chosen him to be gouernour
and generall capteine in that enterprise; he prepared partlie at his owne costs, and partlie at
the charges of the king of Denmarke and other of his friends and alies there, a great multitude both of men of warre and ships, in purpose to passe ouer into Albanie to recouer his
grandfathers estate, which as it was thought might now be the more easilie brought to passe,
sith the Picts would aid him thereto, vpon an earnest desire which they had to reuenge their
owne iniuries receiued at the Romans hands, and to deliuer themselues from such thraldome
as they dailie felt themselues oppressed with, doubting withall shortlie to be quite expelled out
of their whole countrie, as they had b&eacute;ene forced to forgo a great and the better part thereof
alreadie.</p>
<p>In this meane time, one Gratian descended of the British bloud, by consent of the Romane

<note place="marg">Constantine is slaine.</note>

<note place="marg">The lieutenant of the north commeth to London.</note>
passing ouer into France, was slaine there by Constantius one of the capteins of the said Honorius. Victorine the other of the Romane legats hearing of the death both of Martius and
Gonstantine, remooued from Yorke vnto London, the better to prouide for the safe k&eacute;eping
of the land to the emperour Honorius his vse; for that he doubted sundrie dangers which
might chance, by reason the countrie was as then vnprouided of men of warre, the most part
of them being transported ouer into France with the fornamed Constantine, and not againe
returned.</p>
<p>The Picts informed of these things, sent word with all sp&eacute;ed vnto Ferguse, requiring him to
<note place="marg">The Picts send sp&eacute;edilie vnto Ferguse.</note>
make hast, sith if he should haue wished for a conuenient time, a better could not be deuised;
considering the present state of things as well in Britaine, as in other parts of the Romane empire, the people euerie where being readie to moue rebellion. Ferguse vnderstanding the
whole, by such messengers as still came one after another vnto him from the Picts, he hasted to
depart with all diligence; and when all things were readie, he tooke the sea with his armie,
and within eight daies after, he arriued in safetie within the firth of Murrey land with all his 
<note place="marg">Ferguse arriued with his ships in Murrey firth.</note>
vessels and people; where taking land, &amp; word thereof being brought into Ireland, into Orkenie,
and into the westerne Iles, all such of the Scotish linage as liued in those parties in exile, came with
their wiues, children, and whole families in most sp&eacute;edie wise vnto him, as though the countrie had
b&eacute;ene alreadie recouered out of the enimies hands, without all doubts of further perill or businesse.</p>
<p>The Picts also reioising greatlie at the newes of his comming, repaired vnto him, and 
<note place="marg">The Picts ioifullie receiue Ferguse.</note>
shewed him all the honor that might be deuised, beseeching him to pardon and forget all iniuries
and displeasures by them wrought and contriued in times past against the Scotish nation, sith
now they were readie for the aduancement thereof to spend their liues against such as were enimies to the same. Neither was the fault theirs, in that Heirgust had consented with the 
<note place="marg">The Picts craue pardon excusing themselues.</note>
Romans to banish the Scotish people, but in their ancestors, who being blinded through the faire
words and sweete promises of the Romans, saw not the mischiefe which they brought vpon
their owne heads and their posterities. Therefore they desired him to renew againe the league
betwixt the Pictish and Scotish nations, with such conditions of appointment as it should please
him to prescribe.</p>
<p>Ferguse by consent of his nobles answered, that he was content to establish the league with
<note place="marg">Ferguse.</note>
them, euen according to the tenor of the ancient agr&eacute;ement, and to ioine his power with theirs
to helpe to restore them vnto their former estate and liberties, so that they would be contented to surrender vp into the Scotishmens hands, all such townes and countries, from the which
they had b&eacute;ene expelled by great fraud and iniurie. And as for the displeasures doone to the
Scotishmen in times past by aiding the Romans against them (as he thought) the Picts had
<note place="marg">The Picts punished for their vntruthes.</note>
felt punishment inough for the same alreadie, being reduced into most seruile &amp; miserable

bondage, as iustlie rewarded by almightie God for their great vntruthes, vsed and shewed towards
their neighbors, faithfull friends and alies. The Picts were throughlie pleased and satisfied
with Ferguse his words, so that within few daies after, their king (whome they had latelie chosen
since the time that the Scotishmen were thus returned) came vnto Ferguse, and ratified the

though at length through want of victuals and other necessaries, they likewise were deliuered.</p>
<p>&para; If I should here say what I thinke, and that mine opinion might passe for currant coine, I
<note place="marg">When the Scots first got certeine seats here in this Ile of Britaine as some thinke.</note>
would not sticke to affirme that either now first (or not long before their late supposed expulsion from hence) the Scots setled themselues to inhabit here within this Ile, and that they had
no certeine seats in the same till then: but that comming either forth of Ireland, or from the
westerne Iles, where they before inhabited, they vsed to make often inuasions into this land,
greatlie molesting as well the Britains, the ancient inhabitants thereof, as the Romans that
then held the Iles, vnder their subiection. For I can neither persuade my selfe, nor wish
others to bel&eacute;eue, that there was anie such continuance in succession of kings, as their histories doo make mention; &amp; as we haue here before set downe in following the same histories, because we will not willinglie s&eacute;eme to offer iniurie to their nation, which peraduenture
are otherwise persuaded, and thinke the same succession to be most true, where other perchance may coniecture (and not mooued thereto without good reason) that such kings as in
their histories are auouched to reigne one after another here in this Ile, either reigned in Ireland, or in the out Iles, and that verelie not successiuelie, but diuerse of them at one season,
and in diuerse places. Which mistaking of the course of histories hath bred errors, not onelie amongs; the Scotish writers, but euen amongst some of the British and English writers
also, as to the learned and well aduised readers may plainclie appeare. And as for Gald, and
some other happilie which they take to be kings of Scots, although they reigned in that
part of this Ile which afterwards was possessed by Scots, and after them named Scotland, yet
were they m&eacute;ere Britains, and had little to doo with Scots; except perchance we may thinke
that they held the out Iles in subiection, where the Scots were then inhabiting, far longer time
perhaps (before their settling in Britaine) than their histories make mention.</p>
<p>But now to returne where we left. After that Victorine the Romane legat was aduertised

both those nations with open warre: and so therevpon setting forward, he passed foorth till
he came n&eacute;ere Camelon, where he incamped with his whole armie, hauing therein (as the report went) about fiftie thousand persons at the least. Ferguse being aduertised hereof, &amp;
hauing in like maner alreadie assembled a mightie huge host, both of Scotishmen and Picts,

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"came"</fw>-->

<pb n="123"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"123"</fw>-->

came therwith ouer the Forth, &amp; marched forth with all speed in the night season, in 
<note place="marg">Ferguse passeth the Forth. Ferguse purposeth to assaile his enimies in the dawning of the day.</note>
purpose to haue set on his enimies verie earlie in the dawning of the next morning. But Victorine hauing knowledge thereof, commanded his men to be arranged and set in order of
battell by the third watch of the same night, so that being redie to receiue the Scots vpon
their first approch, there was fought a right sore and cruell battell, with such slaughter on
both parts, that the riuer of Carron (n&eacute;ere vnto the which their battels ioined) was well
<note place="marg">The riuer of Carron runneth with bloud.</note>
n&eacute;ere filled with dead bodies, and the water thereof so changed into a ruddie hue, that it
s&eacute;emed as though it had run altogither with bloud.</p>
<p>In the end (whilest as yet it was doubtfull to whether side the victorie would incline)
<note place="marg">The battell seuered by reason of a tempest.</note>
there came such a sudden shower of raine, mixed with such great abundance of hailestones, that neither part was able to haue sight of other, so that by reason of the violent
rage of that huge storme and tempest, either side was faine to withdraw from the other.
There were slaine in this battell such great numbers of men, as well on the one side as the
other, that they had small lust to ioine in battell againe for certeine y&eacute;eres after. For the

<note place="marg">The Scots &amp; Picts breake vp their campe.</note>
Roman lieutenant vnderstanding what losse of people he had susteined, without attempting
anie further exploit, appointed certeine of his companies to lie in garrison within sundrie
fortresses in Pictland, &amp; with the residue he returned into Kent. In like sort the Scots
with their confederates the Picts, perceiuing themselues not able as then to make anie further
attempt against their enimies, brake vp their armie, and deuised onelie how they might defend that which they had alreadie in possession.</p>
<p>And forsomuch as the Pictish nation was increased vnto a greater multitude of people,
than those countries which they then held were able to find with sufficient sustenance (considering what a great portion of their ancient seates the Britains and Romans kept from
them) it was agr&eacute;ed by the Scots that they should inioy the countrie of Athole, with other
<note place="marg">Athole assigned to the Picts.</note>
lands bordering n&eacute;ere vnto the same, lieng without the compasse of the mounteine of
Granzeben. The Picts then being placed in Athole, increased there woonderfullie, and
builded manie faire castels and towers in those parties, to the great beautifieng of that countrie. In which meane while, Victorine the Romane lieutenant commanded the Britains to
<note place="marg">The Britains by the appointment of Victorine make a wall.</note>
make hast with the wall (whereof ye haue heard) made of turfe, and susteined with certeine
posts of timber passing ouerthwart the borders betwixt them and their enimies, begining
(as ye haue heard) at Abercorne, and so stretching foorth by Glasco, and Kirkpatrike, euen
vnto Aldcluch, now Dunbriton, 80 miles more northward than the other wall, which the
emperor Adrian caused (as is said) to be made.</p>
<p>Whereof the Scots and Picts being informed, they assembled themselues togither, &amp; vnder
<note place="marg">The Scotish men &amp; Picts interrupt the making of that wall.</note>
the leading of a noble man called Graime, they set vpon the Britains, as they were busie in
working about the same, and slue not onelie a great number of labourers and souldiers,
which were set to labour and defend the worke, but also entering into the British borders,
fetched from thence a great bootie of cattell and other riches, which they found dispersed
abroad in the countrie. This Graime (who as I said was chiefe in this enterprise) was 
<note place="marg">Graime, otherwise called Graham, and his linage.</note>
brother vnto the Scotish qu&eacute;ene, the wife of king Ferguse. He was borne in Denmarke (as
some hold opinion) in the time of the Scotishmens banishment, and had a Scotishman to his
father descended of a noble house, and a Danish ladie to his mother. He himselfe also
maried a noble woman of that nation, and had by hir a daughter, whome Ferguse by the
<note place="marg">Ferguse maried a daughter of Graime.</note>
persuasion of the king of Denmarke tooke to wife, and had issue by hir (afore his comming

<note place="marg">The Scotish men returne into their countrie.</note>

<note place="marg">Ferguse inuadeth the confines of the Britains.</note>
elders in ancient time had possessed, there came dailie diuerse companies of that nation out
of Spaine, France, Germanie, and Italie (where during the time of their banishment they
had serued vnder sundrie capteins) vnto Ferguse to aid him, in recouerie of their countrie
and ancient seats, out of the which they had b&eacute;ene most cruellie expelled. So that Ferguse
now s&eacute;eing his power thus not a little augmented by their comming, entereth into the borders of Kile, Carike, and Coningham, spoiling and harrieng those countries on euerie side:
but shortlie therevpon commeth the armie of the Romans, with whome the Scots 
<note place="marg">The Scots put to the woorse.</note>
incountering in battell, receiued no lesse damage than they minded to haue doone vnto their aduersaries. Whervpon being forced to leaue that countrie, they drew backe into Argile, where
Ferguse wintered for that part of the y&eacute;ere which yet remained.</p>
<p>When summer was come, he was counselled to haue eftsoones offered battell vnto Victorine, who as then was entered Gallowaie: and rather to trie the vttermost point of 
<note place="marg">Victorine inuadeth Galloway.</note>
fortunes chance against him, than to susteine such displeasures and iniuries at the Romans
hands, as by them were dailie doone vnto him and his people. But there were other that
gaue other aduice, alledging how the danger was great to ieopard againe in battell with the
Romans, being men of such skill &amp; practise in the feats of wars, considering what losse had
<note place="marg">Ferguse is dissuaded to fight with the Romans.</note>
chanced in the two former battels. Againe, there was great likelihood, that if he could be
contented to forbeare for a time, and seeke to defend the borders of his countrie, so well as
he might without giuing battell, it must needs come to passe that shortlie the Romane empire should be brought vnto such ruinous decaie, by reason of the multitude of enimies,
<note place="marg">The Romane empire inuaded by barbarous nations.</note>
which as then inuaded the same on each side, that in the end Victorine doubting his owne
suertie, would conueie himselfe with his men of warre out of the countrie, and then should
it be an easie matter for the Scots and Picts to recouer againe all such countries as ancientlie
belonged to their elders, and wholie to restore the estates of their common-wealths vnto their
former dignities.</p>
<p>This aduise was followed as the best and most likelie, so that making sundrie roads into
the borders of their enimies countries so to k&eacute;epe them still occupied, Ferguse and the Scots
refused vtterlie to come to anie foughten field with them. Shortlie after also it chanced,
that Victorine was accused vnto the emperor Honorius of some secret practise against his
<note place="marg">Victorine accused vnto Honorius.</note>
maiestie, as to be about to vsurpe the crowne of Britaine, wherevnto he was compelled in
d&eacute;ed by the souldiers (whose hearts he had woone through his bountious liberalitie sundrie
waies declared towards them) and vnderstanding at this present, that he was minded to
haue fled his waies for doubt of the said information made against him, they did mooue
him with such earnest persuasions to take vpon him the imperiall dignitie, promising euen
to liue and die with him in defense thereof, as well against Honorius, as all other, that in

But afterwards when one Heraclianus was sent with an armie by Honorius into Britaine
against this Victorine, the most part of the souldiers, with those Britains which had acknowledged him for their supr&eacute;eme gouernor, began to feare the sequele of the matter, and afterward requiring pardon for their offenses, they tooke Victorine, and deliuered him prisoner
vnto the same Heraclianus, with diuers other of his confederats, and so by this means was
the estate of Britaine recouered vnto the behoofe of Honorius, who shortlie after sent for
Heraclianus, minding to send him into Affrike against one Athalus, who vsurped there
against the Romane empire.</p>
<p>At his departure forth of Britaine, he left one Placidus as lieutenant and generall of the
Romane armie in those parties: a man of no great courage, and lesse skill, which being
perceiued of the Scots, gaue occasion to Ferguse their king to renew the warre. And first
he procured Durstus king of the Picts, being the third of that name, to ioine with him in
that enterprise, according to the articles of the league. Who consenting therevnto, when
their powers were once assembled, they entered into the marches of their enimies,

ouerrunning the most part of Kile, Carrike, and Conningham, and after they had taken their

such Romans and Britains as inhabit the same.</p>

them, with whom incountering in battell, after long fight, his horssemen chanced to be
put to flight, so that the legions of his footmen being left naked on the sides, were so sore
beaten with the shot of arrowes, and hurling of darts, that in the end they were forced to
breake their araie, &amp; so being chased left to the Scots and Picts a great and ioifull victorie.
Placidus himselfe escapeth vnto Yorke, whither the Scots were minded to haue pursued
him, had not the want of such numbers as they had lost at the battell, somewhat abated
their couragious intents. In the meane time Placidus not onelie mooued with this ouerthrowe, but also weieng with himselfe after what sort the Romane empire was afficted,
with the inuasion of the barbarous nations in Germanie, France, Spaine, Italie, and Affrike,
thought it good to conclude some peace with the Scots and Picts, for doubt of further 
<note place="marg">Placidus s&eacute;eketh to haue peace.</note>

<note place="marg">A league concluded betwixt Scots, Picts, and Romans.</note>
mishaps that might insue. And so by such meanes as he made, shortlie after a league was
concluded betwixt the Scots, Picts, and Romans, with these conditions: that the Scots and
Picts should inioy and k&eacute;epe their ancient seates and regions, which they had now recouered, &amp; hereafter not to make anie rodes or forreies into the prouince belonging to the
Romans, and that the same Romans contenting themselues with the British confines,
should not mooue anie warre or hostilitie towards the Scots or Picts.</p>
<p>This league being thus concluded and ratified, the Scotishmen and Picts indeuoured themselues to reduce the state of their common-wealth into the ancient forme and order. Ferguse
<note place="marg">Ferguse diuideth the land in parts.</note>
made partition of lands and grounds throughout all his kingdome, and assigned the same
foorth vnto his subiects the Scotishmen, and to such other strangers as were come into Albion,
to serue him in the wars against his enimies, and were minded now to remaine there. The
other that were desirous to depart againe into their countries, he gaue them honorable rewards, with safe conducts to passe their waies at their owne pleasures. At this time also
were the names of diuerse countries &amp; people changed in the parties of Scotland, vpon

againe churchmen vnto their former liuings: and further increased the same where he saw
cause, and builded certeine celles and chappels for religious persons to inhabit in, assigning
vnto them large reuenues for their finding. He also laid the foundation of that famous
abbeie within the Ile of Iona, now Colmekill, appointing the same for the buriall of kings,
with certeine ordinances and customes to be vsed about the same. Moreouer, in the time
of peace hee was not negligent in prouiding for the defense of his realme. Such castels
as were decaied and ouerthrowne by the enimies in the warre time, he repared; and in those

out of this life, by reason whereof the Scotishmen and Picts tooke occasion to renew the
warres, making as it were a claime vnto the countries of Westmerland &amp; Cumberland,
which their elders in times past had held and possessed. Entering therefore into those
countries, they take, spoile, and destroie all such of the British nation as went about to
destroie them; neither spared they impotent, aged, or others, but shewed great crueltie
against all such as came in their waies. Manie an honest woman they rauished and misused
after a most villainous maner. The Romane souldiers, after the deceasse of Placidus, ordeined one Castius to succeed in his roome, who being aduertised of this enterprise of the

<note place="marg">Dionethus, or Dionotus, as some books haue.</note>

<note place="marg">Castius sendeth vnto Ferguse.</note>
Scotishmen and Picts, doubted least (as the truth was) that Dionethus the sonne of Octauius
sometime king of the Britains, in hope to atteine the crowne of Britaine, as due to him
by inheritance, would now s&eacute;eke to aid the Scotish king Ferguse, whose sister he had in
mariage. Castius therefore more desirous of peace than of warres, sent foorth a messenger
at armes vnto king Ferguse, requiring him to remember the league made betwixt him and
the Romans, and to withdraw his power foorth of the prouinces, which were subiect vnto
the same Romans, without proc&eacute;eding anie further in that vnlawfull attempt, either else he
should be sure to feele the puissant force of those people readie bent against him, by whom
his elders had b&eacute;ene driuen out of their countries, and banished quite foorth of all their
dwellings and places of habitation in Albion.</p>
<p>But herevnto was answer made with great indignation, that as for the league thus 
<note place="marg">The answer of king Ferguse.</note>
alledged, ceassed by the death of Placidus; and as for peace, there was no cause why he
should looke for anie, vntill the whole prouinces, both of Westmerland and Cumberland,
were restored againe into the hands of the Scotishmen and Picts, according as of reason
they ought to be. The like answer also was made by Durstus king of the Picts, vnto
whom Castius had sent a like message. Wherewithall the said Castius being not a little

<p>Which newes sore appalled the hearts of the Britains, but yet being incouraged with comfortable words of their capteins to proc&eacute;ed, forward they go togither with the Romans, and
within thr&eacute;e daies after, they came within sight of their enimies, b&eacute;eing ranged in battell
readie to receiue them, so that streightwaies buckeling togither, there was a right fierce and

cruell battell fought betwixt them, till finallie the multitude of the Scotish archers and kernes
so compassed in the battels of the Romans on each side, and speciallie on the backes, that
in the end, and by reason of the losse of their generall Castius (who was slaine there
amongst them) those of the middle ward being discomfited, brake their arraie and fled.

<note place="marg">The Scots follow in the chase too rashlie.</note>
Wherevpon the residue likewise followed: the Scots, Picts, and Welshmen, pursuing so

the which in their giuing backe, kept themselues close togither, readie to defend themselues,
and to beat downe such of their enimies as followed more rashlie than warilie in the chase,
not once regarding to k&eacute;epe any order of battell; but yet by other companies that pursued
more orderlie togither for their most aduantage, there was great slaughter made both of

Valentinianus, who vnderstanding all these things by letters and messengers sent from the capteins
which yet remained aliue in Britaine, appointed one Maximianus being of kin to the 
<note place="marg">Maximianus sent ouer into Britaine.</note>
emperor, to passe with an armie in all hast ouer into Britaine, to aid and succor the Romans,
and such Britains there, as still continued in their allegiance which they had promised vnto
the Romane empire.</p>
<p>This Maximianus at his arriuall in the Iland was most ioifullie receiued by the soldiors and
subiects of the foresaid empire. All the lords and nobles of the countrie resorted also vnto
him, shewing themselues most glad of his comming, &amp; promising with what aid soeuer they
were able to make, to go with him against their enimies. Wherevpon, procuring them to

assemble their powers, and to ioine the same with his, which he had brought ouer with him,
he passed through the countrie vnto Yorke, and so from thence marched foorth towards the
Scots, being alreadie assembled in campe to defend the countrie of Westmerland against
him. There were both the kings of Scots and Picts, Ferguse and Durstus, with Dionethus,
naming himselfe king of the Britains, who had brought with him, beside the Welshmen, a
great number of those Britains that inhabited in the countries now accounted the marches
of Wales, the which onelie amongst all other the Britains acknowledged him for king.</p>
<p>When both the armies were come n&eacute;ere togither, they camped for that night the one in sight

<note place="marg">Ferguse exhorteth his people to doo valiantlie.</note>

<note place="marg">Right ministreth hope of good successe.</note>
of the other, and in the morning following they prepared themselues to battell. Ferguse
first making an earnest oration vnto his people, to incourage them the more boldlie to giue
the onset, declared amongst other things how the right was on their sides, which alwaies
ought to minister hope of good successe in them that enterprise anie thing in defense thereof;
where contrarilie all such as attempted to disquiet other by iniurie and wrong dooing, could
not but looke for an euill conclusion of their malicious intents and purposes. Neither were
other of his capteins negligent in their duties, but that both in exhorting their bands, they
vsed most comfortable woords, and in disposing them in good order of battell, they shewed
most readie and earnest diligence.</p>
<p>On the other side, Maximianus with his capteins and officers of bands were as busie on
their side to array their battels most for their aduantage, as they saw cause and occasion, so
that both the armies being readie to fight, the onset was giuen, and that in most furious wise,
<note place="marg">The onset is giuen.</note>
the Romans being at the first sore annoied with arrowes and darts, which flue so thicke
from ech side, that their sight was in manner taken from them, the skie s&eacute;eming as it had

<note place="marg">The Scots disordered.</note>
caused a fresh legion of his soldiors to aduance forward to the succour of their fellowes; by
reason whereof the battell was foorthwith most cruellie renewed, the hindermost wings of the
Romans sore preasing vpon their enimies: so that in the end passing quite through their
battels, they caused a great disorder and feare amongest those Scots and other their confederats, which were placed in the hindermost ranks. But yet casting themselues in a ring,
they made great &amp; stout resistance for a space, and at length a great number euen of the
most valiant personages of the whole host, closed themselues togither, and with maine force
assaied to haue broken through the thickest prease of their enimies, but being inuironed
about on ech part, they were there slaine ech mothers sonne. Whilest the Romans drew
togither to resist on that side, other of the Scotishmen, Picts, Britains, &amp; Welshmen, found
a waie to get foorth through their enimies on the other side, and so being gotten past them,
made awaie as fast as their f&eacute;et might beare them: but a great number being notwithstanding
ouertaken, were slaine and beaten downe right pitifullie.</p>

the sea side, and there getting a ship, passed ouer into Wales. This ouerthrow sore dismaied both the Scotish and Pictish nations, who looked for nothing more than present expulsion out of their countries, for Maximianus pursuing the victorie, burst into Galloway,
most cruellie wasting and spoiling the same. And when he had made an end there, he
entred into Anandale, and into the Pictish confines, destroieng all before him with fire and

<note place="marg">Camelon taken by force.</note>
with diuerse other notable townes and places, as well belonging to the Picts as Scots.
Neither was there anie end of these cruell dooings, till both the Scots &amp; Picts for their

refuge were generallie constreined to withdraw themselues beyond the wall of Abircorne,
which (as before is said) a few yeeres passed was begun by the Britains, and stretched from
Abircorne aforesaid, ouerthwart the land vnto Alcluth now Dunbreton.</p>
<p>Maximianus hauing thus driuen his enimies beyond this wall, caused them to make assurance by their oth of couenant, neuer to passe the same againe by waie of hostilitie, either
against the Britains or Romans. There were that counselled Maximianus either vtterlie to
haue destroied both the Scots and Picts, either els to haue driuen them out of the whole
Ile. But he being satisfied with that which was alreadie doone, thought good to returne
vnto Yorke, and there to winter, that in the beginning of the next spring he might go into
Wales, to chastise Dionethus and other of that countrie for their rebellion, in aiding the
enimies of the empire. But when the time came that he should haue set forward on that
iournie, he heard such newes from the parties of beyond the seas, into what ruinous decaie
the empire was fallen, without anie likelihood of recouerie, that changing his purpose, he
minded to vsurpe the crowne of Britaine as absolute king thereof himselfe. And to haue

coopled in mariage with Maximianus was called Othilia, &amp; the other daughter named Vrsula
was professed a nun in an house of religion, to the intent that the whole right which Dionethus pretended to the realme, might remaine to the wife of Maximianus. Then was

not sparing to pursue with fire and swoord all such of the Britains as did yet continue in
obeisance to Maximianus.</p>
<p>They first droue those Britains out of all the countries, which had b&eacute;ene taken from them
by the same Maximianus, and by other of the Romans and Britains, as Pictland, Kile, Carrike, and Coningham, Galloway, the Marches, and Northumberland. This doone, they
entered into Cumberland, Westmerland, and Kendall, not ceassing till they had spoiled and

defaced all those countries, with the most part of all Yorkeshire, in such cruell wise, that
they made all those quarters barren both of corne and cattell, which waie soeuer they passed.
The Britains perceiuing into what danger they were brought, if some good redresse were
not found in time, sent ouer with all sp&eacute;ed vnto Rome for succor to be had at the emperor
<note place="marg">The Britains require aid of Valentinian the emperor.</note>
Valentinians hands, for Maximianus was otherwise occupied. Valentinian desirous to deliuer the Britains from such cruell enimies as the Scots &amp; Picts shewed themselues to be,
least through their meanes all the whole Ile should reuolt from the obedience of the Romans, appointed one Gallio borne in Rauenna, and as then soiorning about Paris in France,
<note place="marg">Gallio Rauennas is sent ouer into Britaine.</note>
with a legion of soldiors to passe ouer into Britaine, to driue backe the Scots and Picts from

<p>The Scots and Picts, vpon knowledge had of this Gallios arriuall, drew backe into their

countries, not minding to fight with the Romans, whose force they doubted, and not without cause, hauing had in times past so manie ouerthrowes and slaughters at their hands.
But Gallio pursued them euen vnto the water of Forth, where in sundrie skirmishes he slue
<note place="marg">Gallio pursueth the Scots and Picts.</note>
no small number of them: and for that he knew he should be sent for shortlie to returne
againe into France, to helpe to resist such barbarous nations as warred in the same, for the
better defense of the Britains against their enimies the Scots and Picts (whome he knew
would not be anie while in quiet after he was once gone) he caused the wall to be newlie

<note place="marg">The maner of the building of that wall.</note>
made vp betwixt Abircorne &amp; the mouth of Clude water, thereby to defend the Romane
prouince from all sudden inuasions of the enimies. This wall was earst made of turffe, but
now repared with stone, and strengthened with great posts or piles of wood, driuen in betwixt in places most n&eacute;edfull. It was also 8 foot broad, and 12 foot high. And in certeine
turrets cast foorth vpon this wall, Gallio appointed watch &amp; ward to be kept, that vpon the

such knowledge had, should resort immediatlie to the place appointed, with such armour
and weapon as for him was requisit.</p>
<p>When Gallio had thus giuen order for the suertie of the Britains, and deliuered them at

that present from the cruell hands of their enimies, he returned into France with the armie

Scots and Picts, but that with all their maine force they determined to set vpon the Britains

yet at the length by great force the wall was vndermined and throwen downe in sundrie
<note place="marg">The wall is ouerthrowen.</note>
places, so that the whole number of the Scots and Picts entered by the same into Pictland,
beating downe the Britains on ech side that went about to make resistance, for none escaped
their hands, but such as saued themselues by flight.</p>
<p>There came also an other power of Scots and Picts by water out of Fife, and landing in
Pictland, pursued the Britains with more crueltie than the kings did themselues. Both
houses and people passed by fire and sword, insomuch that all such of the Britains as
could get away, withdrew foorth of the countrie, not staieng till they came beyond the
<note place="marg">The Britains Ieaue Pictland and get themselues ouer the riuer of Tine.</note>
riuer of Tine; by reason whereof, all the countrie which lieth betwixt Tw&eacute;ed and Tine
was deliuered by appointment of the kings vnto the souldiers, to spoile and vse at their
pleasure, wherevpon followed manie notorious examples of crueltie, enuie, couetousnesse,
wrath &amp; malice. In the meane time, whilest the Scotish and Pictish men of warre applied
their market, the Britains with all diligence repared and newlie fortified the other wall begun
<note place="marg">The wall of Adrian is repared by the Britains.</note>
(as is said) by the emperour Adrian, shooting ouerthwart the countrie from the riuer of
Tine, vnto the riuer of Eske.</p>
<p>Howbeit the Scots and Picts, because winter approched, made no further attempt against
the Britains at that time, but diuiding those countries which lie by north from the foresaid
<note place="marg">The countries lieng north from the wall of Adrian diuided amongest the Scots and Picts.</note>
wall of Adrian, among themselues, according to the order in that behalfe appointed by their
kings, they fortified certeine castels and holds for defense of the same countries, as it were
to countergarison such Britains as continuallie kept watch and ward vpon the foresaid wall.
The Britains therefore mistrusting least so soone as the spring were come, the Scots would
inuade their countries which lay on the south part of the same wall, breaking in by force
through it, as they had doone the yere before through the other wall of Abircorne, they
sent ambassadors vnto Etius the Romane lieutenant, gouerning Gallia now called France,
<note place="marg">The Britains require aid at the hands of Etius.</note>
vnder the emperor Valentinian, requiring to haue some aid and succour at his hands, whereby
to resist such fierce and cruell enimies, as sought to destroy and expell out of their lands
and houses, all such of the Britains as acknowledged themselues in anie maner of wise
subiects vnto the empire.</p>
<p>But Etius, whether he would not, or rather because he conuenientlie could not (for that
<note place="marg">Etius refuseth to aid the Britains.</note>
he was otherwise occupied in defense of Gallia against the French men) made a direct answere that he had no men of warre in store to send ouer into Britaine, and therefore
willed them to doo what they could for their owne defense, for aid of him they might none
haue. The messengers returned home with this answere, and made report thereof in a
publike assemblie of all the British nobilitie, being as then gathered togither at London to
consult there for the estate and order of their countrie. Where after long deliberation
<note place="marg">The Britains forsaken of the Romans, determine yet to make resistance.</note>
(notwithstanding that they perceiued they should haue no more aid from the Romans) it
was yet determined, that to resist the enimies, the whole puissance of the British nation
should be mustered, as well men as women, being able to doo anie feat of seruice auailable in defense of their countrie, &amp; rather to trie the vttermost point of fortunes chance, than
to suffer themselues to be ouerrun without resistance. But Conanus Camber, a prince of
<note place="marg">Conanus Camber counselleth the Britains to s&eacute;eke peace at the Scotish mens hands.</note>
great authoritie amongest them, as one that was descended of the bloud of Octauius sometime king of Britaine, went about with earnest p&eacute;rsuasions to remoue the residue of the
nobilitie from this determination, aduising them to s&eacute;eke for peace at the Scotishmens hands,
rather than to trie the doubtfull chance of Mars his iudgement, considering the f&eacute;eblenesse
<note place="marg">Britaine dispeopled of warlike men by Maximianus.</note>

<note place="marg">Conanus counsell is receiued.</note>
of their whole force now, euer since that the tyrant Maximianus had in manner emptied and
dispeopled the land of all such able men as were apt for seruice in the warres. But this
aduise of Conanus was verie euill taken, &amp; moued the multitude that heard him, to be
greatlie offended with his words, not sparing to say that he spake like no true man nor louer
of his countrie; so that the former ordinance (that is to say, to s&eacute;eke an end of the wars
by dint of swoord) was allowed for the best.</p>

appointed, where they should assemble togither to march foorth towards the enimie. Conanus
sore lamenting their dooings, called almightie God to record, that that which he had said,
was spoken onelie for the loue &amp; zeale which he bare to his countrie, &amp; sithence his aduise
might not be followed, he doubted greatlie least the ruine of the British state by some fatall

<p>In this meane time, whilest the Britains were thus busied in sending of their ambassadours to

was the greatest dooer. Which being accomplished, the Scotish and Pictish kings assembled
<note place="marg">The Scotish and Pictish kings inuade the British borderers.</note>
their powers, and ouerthrew all such fortresses as had not b&eacute;ene destroied the yeare before,
standing on the northside of Adrians wall, the which wall the Britains had newlie fortified, but

<p>The entrie being thus woone, both the kings with their powers marched forth into the south
countries, commandement being giuen that no man vpon paine of death should kill anie woman or child, aged person, or otherwise impotent and not able to beare armour. But
this commandement in some places was but slenderlie obeied; such desire of reuenge was
planted in the Scotishmens hearts, by reason of the remembrance of old iniuries, that vnneath
<note place="marg">Crueltie of Scots.</note>
made they anie difference either of age or sex. To be short, all those countries which lie betwixt the riuers of Tine and Humber, were wasted &amp; spoiled, the whole number of the inhabitants (such as could make shift to escape the enimies hands) got them ouer the foresaid
riuer of Humber, there to remaine as further out of danger. The report of which mischiefe
being brought to London, the lords there (who as ye haue heard were not all of one accord

present dooth require, that without all remedie the land of the Britains being taken awaie from the
Romans, must needs be brought vnder the subiection of some barbarous nation, we neither abhorre nor refuse the gouernement of anie people or nation, the Scots and Picts (the most cruell
of all other) onelie excepted, whose crueltie we hauing long since too too much tasted, are at
this present brought vnto that point by their late increased puissance, that we know not now
after the losse of our goods and cattell, which way to safe gard our liues, for the turffe walls
being pulled downe, and the ditches filled vp with earth, which aforetime did somewhat staie
them, now breaking in vpon vs without letting passe anie one kind of crueltie, they haue destroied our fields, burned vp our houses, townes &amp; villages, beaten downe &amp; raced euen to the
ground our castels and towers, with such other places of defense, not sparing to put to the
sword as well the poore innocent children, women, and impotent aged as such other innumerable numbers of men, which they haue slaine standing at defense with weapon in hand. And
as for vs, which are the residue of our decaied nation, they haue driuen euen to the sea side,
and from thence (because we cannot passse ouer) we are put backe vpon our enimies againe.
And hereof proc&eacute;ed two kinds of our destruction, for either we are drowned in the raging
flouds, either else slaine most vnmercifullie by our cruell enimies. Therefore if the honor of
the Romane people, if our assured loialtie and loue, which we beare to the empire of Rome,
now continued for the space of these 500 yeares or thereabout, may moue you to rue on our
miseries, we humblie pray and beseech you, not to suffer vs longer to be trodden vnder foot
of these our most beastlie and cruell enimies, but send vnto vs some conuenable succors and
that with all sp&eacute;ed, least we s&eacute;eme to be more cruellie betraied of the Romans, than brought

for all other to beware, how they put confidence hereafter either in the rule or friendship of

<p>Paulus Diaconus, Beda, Geffray of Monmouth, Veremound, and others make mention of
<note place="marg">But not so largelie as here is expressed.</note>

<note place="marg">The answere of Etius.</note>
these foresaid letters. Wherevpon Etius answering, declared that those calamities, misfortunes and losses susteined by the Britains were right displeasant vnto him, and so much the
more, for that through the sundrie inuasions made, aswell into France as also into Italie it selfe,
and into other parties of the Romane empire by people of sundrie nations, he could not as then
spare anie men of warre to send ouer vnto them, &amp; therefore he willed the Britains to make
the best shift they could to defend themselues for a time, till things were better quieted in other
parties, and then should they s&eacute;e such redresse of their iniuries prouided, as they should thinke
themselues to be verie well reuenged. About the same time that the ambassadours returned
with this answere vnto London from Etius, the other also came backe foorth of the north without hope to sp&eacute;ed of that about the which they had bin sent, for the Scots &amp; Picts would 
<note place="marg">The Scots and Picts would agr&eacute;e vpon no reasonable conditions of peace.</note>
incline to no reasonable conditions of peace, vnlesse the Britains would wholie submit themselues
as subiects vnto them. The Britains hereat tooke such indignation, that by generall consent they
agreed to trie it out with the enimies by maine force; &amp; hereupon made their prouision with
all diligence. The Scots and Picts hearing of the Britains intents, gathered their people 
<note place="marg">The Scots and Picts prepare against the Britains.</note>
togither with more sp&eacute;ed than was thought possible for them to haue doone, &amp; foorthwith rushed into the borders of their enimies countries in right puissant wise and most warlike order.</p>
<p>In the fore ward went such as came foorth of Galloway and Annandale, with those Picts which
<note place="marg">The order of the Scots and Picts entring into the lands of the Britains.</note>
inhabited about the coasts of Barwike. Then followed there a mightie battell of those which
came foorth of Argile, Athole, and other Picts inhabiting n&eacute;ere vnto the parties of Kalendar
and Camelone with them of Fife, and Angus. In the midst of this battell both the kings
kept their place with their choisest souldiers, and standards borne afore them. Then went
the carriage and trusse of the armie, next wherevnto a great number of noble men of both the
nations followed in faire order of battell, with their seruants and men of warre the best they
could choose foorth. And last of all (as the maner of those nations hath beene euen from the
beginning) there came a great multitude of the c&omacr;mons vp the back of the whole aforesaid armie.</p>
<p>The Britains also comming foorth into the field with their whole puissance to incounter
their enimies, when they vnderstood by espials the order and maine force of the Scots and Picts,

they were halfe discouraged in their minds, and thought good therefore once againe to assaie
<note place="marg">The Britains doubt to ioine with the maine armie of the Scots and Picts.</note>
if anie peace might be purchased. But sending foorth their ambassadours vnto the confederat kings, to that end their answere was, that except the Britains would y&eacute;eld themselues, their
wiues and children, with all their goods and substance into the hands of their enimies, simplie
without all conditions, there would be no peace granted. When this was knowen abroad in
<note place="marg">The Britains vpon the Scotishmens refusall to haue peace, require to haue battell.</note>
the host of the Britains, what thorough kindeled ire on the one part, and foule despaire on the
other, prouoking their minds to displeasure, they generallie vpon change of purpose required
battell, euen all the whole number of them.</p>
<p>Heereof insued a most cruell and mortall fight: for the Britains (as it were) resoluted to die
in defense of their countrie, and to reuenge their owne deaths vpon their enimies, with more
fiercenesse than is credible to be thought, gaue the onset, and ouerthrew a great number of
<note place="marg">The fierce onset giuen by the Britains.</note>
their enimies, insomuch that those of Galloway and the Picts fighting in the fore ward with
them of Argile, Athole, and such other as were in the battell with the kings, were in great danger to be put to the woorse: which Graime perceiuing (by whome the most part of the armie
<note place="marg">Graimes authoritie in ordering of the battels.</note>
was ruled, and that by commandement of both the kings) called foorth a number of the Ilandmen, who were appointed to attend the cariage, and sent them with all diligence to the fore
ward to the succors of them of Galloway, being then at the point to haue sought refuge by
flight. But by the comming of these Iland-men to their succors, they tooke courage afresh,
<note place="marg">Those of the westerne Iles comming to the succors of the fore ward, restored the battell.</note>

<note place="marg">The Britains run awaie.</note>
so that the battell was againe most fiercelie renewed, and so continued a space with great slaughter on both parts, till finallie the Britains being oppressed with the multitude of their enimies,
and not able longer to indure, fell to running awaie, thinking to saue themselues in certeine
bogs, mosses, and marish grounds neere vnto the place of the battell: but such coisterels, and
other as remained with the Scotish cariage, s&eacute;eing the discomfiture of their aduersaries, ran
foorth and pursued them into those marishes, killing and taking no small number of them.
There were slaine in this battell of the Britains, aboue 15 thousand, and of the Scots and Picts
<note place="marg">The number of them that were slaine on both sides.</note>
n&eacute;ere hand foure thousand.</p>
<p>The Britains hauing receiued this ouerthrow, saw no helpe which waie to recouer their
losses, but onelie to sue for peace at the victorers hands. They sent therefore an orator vnto
the Scotish &amp; Pictish kings, beseeching them humblie to grant them a peace, euen with what
conditions it should please them to prescribe. The kings not mooued onelie with the present
<note place="marg">The Britains make humble sute for peace.</note>
fortune of the Britains, but also partlie with their owne, hauing lost no small number of right
worthie personages in the battell, were contented to grant a peace vpon these conditions: That
<note place="marg">Peace granted by the Scots with the conditions of the same.</note>
the Britains should in no wise receiue anie lieutenant or armie hereafter from Rome, nor suffer anie enimie of the Scotish and Pictish estats, of what nation soeuer he were, to passe
through their countrie. They should enter into no league with anie citie or nation, nor be about
to make anie warres without consent of the Scotish and Pictish kings, and further should be readie to serue them against all maner of enimies whensoeuer they should be sent for. Moreouer,
they should remooue with their wiues, children, and whole families out of all those countries, lieng
betwixt Tine and Humber, resigning the possession of the same vnto the Scotishmen and Picts.</p>
<p>Also they should giue thr&eacute;escore thousand peeces of gold then currant to the Scotish &amp;
<note place="marg">60000 pound saith <emph>Balantine,</emph> after the rate of Scotish monie.</note>

<note place="marg">20000 pound saith the same <emph>Balantine,</emph> so that he esteemeth those p&eacute;eces of gold to be of the value of French crownes.</note>

<note place="marg">436. <emph>H. B.</emph></note>
Pictish kings, towards the dispatch of their souldiors wages, and further should y&eacute;eld as a tribute twentie thousand peeces of gold, to be paid yeerelie vnto the seuerall vses of the victorers.
They should likewise deliuer one hundred hostages of such as the two kings shuld appoint,
betwixt the age of eight&eacute;ene and thirtie yeers. These conditions of peace though they s&eacute;emed
verie streict &amp; greeuous to the British nobilitie, yet for that they vnderstood not how to make
a better bargaine, they persuaded the multitude to accept them, and so a league therevpon was
concluded amongst those people, and the publike state of the land brought to a more quiet
rule than it had b&eacute;ene before. Thus were the Britains made tributarie to the Scotishmen
and Picts, about 500 y&eacute;eres after Iulius Cesar had brought them in subiection to the Romans,
being in the y&eacute;ere after the birth of our Sauiour 446, and of Eugenius his reigne ouer the
Scotishmen the seuenth.

<p>Moreouer he instituted one Seruan bishop of the Orkenies, that he might instruct the inhabitants there in the faith of Christ, which as yet they had not receiued: and one Teruan, whome
he himselfe had baptised, he made archbishop of Pictland. In these daies also manie strange
sights were s&eacute;ene in sundrie parts of Britaine before the last mentioned ouerthrow: the moone
being in plaine opposition to the sunne, when it should be most round, appeared in a quadrant
figure. At Yorke it rained bloud: and tr&eacute;es in sundrie places being blasted, withered and
died. The market place, or rather (if ye will so tearme it) Cheapeside in London opened,
so that a great hole appeared, and manie houses were swallowed vp. About the same season
also (as is supposed) liued that huge personage Finmacoell, a Scotishman borne of seuen 
<note place="marg">Finmacoell the great hunter.</note>
cubites in height. He was a great hunter, and sore feared of all men by reason of his mightie

<p>The Romane empire being brought into irrecouerable ruine by the Vandals, Gothes,
Hunnes, Frenchmen, and other barbarous nations, occupieng sundrie parts and portions
thereof, put the Britains out of all hope to haue anie assistance from the emperors, which
caused them to remaine in quiet certein y&eacute;ers without attempting any exploit against the Scots
or Picts, and so duelie paid their couenanted tribute, though sore against their wils, if they
might otherwise haue remedied it. At the last about ten y&eacute;ers after the c&omacr;clusion of this last
<note place="marg">Conanus a Britaine goeth about to persuade his countriemen to breake the peac&eacute; concluded with the Scots and Picts.</note>
peace, it chanced that one Conanus the sonne of the aboue mentioned Conanus, descended of

thus brought into thraldome of the Scotish nation, and deuising how to find some redres,
called togither the most part of the British nobilitie, by secret message home to a manour place
which he had within a thicke wood in the countrie of Kent, and there opening vnto them a
great p&eacute;ece of his mind, persuaded them with the weightiest reasons he could imagine, to
leuie warre against the Scots and Picts, hauing at that present, meanes now since the last
warres to mainteine it, as well by reason of their increase both of able men, as also of substance
to furnish them withall.</p>
<p>H&eacute;ere the nobles were of sundrie opinions: for some awearied with the note of bondage, would

them, that gaue knowledge to the confederate kings what motion had b&eacute;ene made, and what
was intended against them. Wherevpon they immediatlie determined, not onelie to cause
the hostages to be executed, but also to pursue the rebels with fierce and cruell warres. Yet
before they practised anie violence, they sent their ambassadors vnto the Britains, to vnderstand
their full meaning, and to declare vnto them further certeine articles which the said kings required to haue performed without all delaies, or else to looke for open warre out of hand.</p>
<p>The chiefest points of which articles were these. First that the Britains should not assemble togither in councell without licence of the Scotish and Pictish kings, notwithstanding that
their ancient laws they might vse at their pleasure, but they should receiue no stranger into
their countrie being a Romane or a Frenchman, neither merchant nor other, Their old

hostages they should receiue home againe, and deliuer in exchange of them twise so manie in
number of the like age and degr&eacute;e, as was couenanted by the former league. The commons
of the land vnderstanding what was demanded by these ambassadors, were in a woonderfull
rage, and would haue made a great sturre if they had not beene quieted by the lords, who for
their paines taken herein, got them an euill report amongst the inferior sort of people, as
though through their want of stomach onlie, the common-wealth was brought into such a miserable estate, that looke what it pleased the enimie to charge the British nation with, no man
durst once speake against it.</p>
<p>This grudge of the commons increased so farre foorth against their superiors, that after the
Scotish and Pctish ambassadors were returned home, with answer agr&eacute;eable to their demandes,
<note place="marg">The commons of Britaine conspire against the nobles.</note>
there arose incontinentlie a great commotion of the people, conspiring togither the vtter destruction of the whole nobilitie. But their furie was repressed, so that they were ouerthrowne
in battell at two seuerall times with great slaughter and bloudshed, wherevpon they withdrew
into the mounteins, and there kept themselues, making raises vpon the nobilitie, and fetching
booties awaie from the heards and flocks of cattell belonging to the lords and gentlemen: but
finallie through famine which began to oppresse both parties, they perceiued what n&eacute;ed the
<note place="marg">One estate of men cannot liue without helpe of anoher.</note>
one-had of the others helpe, and so they agr&eacute;ed. This ciuill warre sore decaied the force
of the Britains, for beside the great slaughter that was made betwixt them, by the auoiding of
the commons out of their houses, the ground laie vntilled, whereof insued a maruellous great
scarsitie and dearth of all things, by reason whereof an innumerable sort of people died. Yet
<note place="marg">Superfluous welth occasion of vice.</note>
shortlie after followed such plentie, that those that were left aliue forgetting the passed miseries,
gaue themselues vp to all kind of vice, which tooke such root in the hearts of the more part
of them, that for anie man to vse anie maner of vertue amongst them, was a readie meane to

studies onelie how to instruct their people now after the warres were once ended, in laudable
exercises and necessarie occupations, conuenient for the time of peace, wherby their realmes
might flourish in welth and prosperitie without dread of anie forren power. For they saw such
tokens of ruine in the British estate, as small likelihood appeared, that the same should at anie
time be able to recouer againe the former force and dignitie. Finallie the Scotish king Eugenius hauing aduanced the estate of his countrie vnto more felicitie and wealth than anie of
his predecessors had euer doone before him, after he had reigned thirtie y&eacute;eres, he ended his

in the estate. He began his reigne in the y&eacute;ere 470, and his ch&eacute;efest studie was, according
to his brothers example, to prouide for the maintenance of good orders and iustice, appointing
in euerie quarter men of good fame and report to haue the administration vnder him, with
commandement that they should diligentlie fors&eacute;e, that euerie man might inioy his owne.
He himselfe tooke vpon him also to see to the reparing of such castels as were decaied, and
to the building vp of new in places where he thought most expedient, speciallie n&eacute;ere to the
British borders, for he well considered that peace increased riches, riches pride and presumption, with other sinnes, which could not long indure without the plague of wars. Therefore
he doubting the changes of scornefull fortune, thought good in time of peace to prouide for
the dangers of warre, when the same should happen vnto him.</p>
<p>These ciuill policies and princelie prouisions for defense of his countrie and subiects increased
the fame of Dongard mightilie, but that which he did towards the aduancement of religion
did most exc&eacute;edinglie set foorth his commendation. First, all such religious men as followed

<note place="marg">The bountious liberalitie of Dongard towards churchmen.</note>
lands, houses, and other kinds of reuenues in diuers places of his realme, and granted not
onelie vnto them, but also vnto all other, being within anie orders of clergie, sundrie priuileges, appointing that the churches &amp; abbeies with other holie places should be infranchised
and taken for sanctuaries, that all such as fled to the same for safegard of their liues, should
<note place="marg">Sanctuaries.</note>
be suffered to rest in peace, so long as they kept them within the same.</p>
<p>About the same time also, and whilest these things were thus a dooing in Scotland, the
Britains being awearied of their seruile estate, through the setting on of Conanus, conspired
together, and tooke aduise by what meanes they might best s&eacute;eke to deliuer themselues from
the thraldome of Scots and Picts, and vpon aduise taken they concluded to send ouer into
Britaine Armorike some honorable ambassage vnto Androenus the king of that countrie for
<note place="marg">The Britains send into Britaine Armorike for aid.</note>
aid. H&eacute;erewith was the archbishop of London appointed as chiefe ambassador to go on
that message, which archbish&omacr;p vsed such diligence in the matter, that Constantine the sonne
of the said Androenus was appointed by his father with a competent power of men to go
<note place="marg">Aid sent into Britaine from the Armorike Britains.</note>
ouer into great Britaine to the aid of the British inhabitants there. H&eacute;erevpon, when the
men &amp; ships with all necessarie prouision were once readie, he imbarked at Saint Malo, where
the assemblie was made, and taking the sea, sailed foorth with prosperous wind and weather,
which brought him safelie into great Britaine, where he landed at Totnes in Deuonshire, as
you shall find in the chronicles of England. He was receiued with no small ioy, and 
<note place="marg">Constantine proclamed king of Britaine.</note>
foorthwith proclamed king of Britine, wherevpon he promised to assaie to the vttermost of his
power to recouer againe their whole lands and liberties, and to mainteine them in the same
according to their wished desires.</p>
<p>For the more speedie accomplishment h&eacute;ereof, commandement was first giuen, that all
<note place="marg">The assemblie of the British armie.</note>
able men should be in a readinesse, and come togither at a place appointed neere to the
riuer of Humber within fortie daies after. Which order being taken by the aduise of the
lords and nobles of the realme, the same was put in execution with such diligence, that few
or none being apt to beare armor, withdrew themselues, euerie man in manner comming
to the appointed place of the assemblie, and offering to go against the enimies, so that it
<note place="marg">The great earnestnes of the Britains to recouer their libertie.</note>
was a woonder to consider the consent of the people now ioined in one mind and will to
recouer their former libertie. When Constantine beheld such notable numbers of men, he
supposed the same would haue sufficed not onelie to vanquish the Scots and Picts, but
also vtterlie to destroie &amp; race them out of all the confines of Albion.</p>
<p>When the newes of all this preparation for warres which the Britains made, was once
signified to the Scots and Picts, they likewise made their apprestes to meet with them in the

field, and therevpon raising their powers, came foorth with the same into Yorkeshire, and
pitched their camps within foure miles where Constantine with his people was lodged, and
the next day after, vnderstanding how n&eacute;ere vnto the enimie they were, they raised and
marched forwards till they came within sight of him, as then incamped with his people
aloft vpon certeine hils, n&eacute;ere to the aforesaid riuer side. Here both the kings of Scots and
Picts lodging with their armies for that night, made readie for battell against the next day,
and in the morning Dongard the Scotish king getting him to a little hill, called his men togither, &amp; there exhorted them by sundrie comfortable means of persuasion to put awaie all

<p>He had scarse made an end of his woords, but that diuerse of the standing watch came in,
and declared how the Britains began to auale the hils where they had lodged, and that the
Picts were got foorth alreadie in order of battell, and were marching forwards to incounter
them. Dongard shewing himselfe to be right ioifull of these newes, commanded incontinentlie, that the standards should aduance foorth, and euerie man to attend the same according to his appointed order. Also that no man should presume to take anie prisoner
before the end of the battell, nor to y&eacute;eld himselfe so long as life lasted. So that ioining

<p>Diuers of the Scots discomfited with this great mishap, fell to running awaie: other
kindled with more wrath laid about them more egerlie. The Picts also, for their part
fought most constantlie, so that the battell, continuing vntill noone daie with doubtfull successe, at length the Britains were constreined something to giue backe, &amp; after taking

after the battell, withdrew southwards. The Scots carried away with them the corps of
their dead king, and conueieng it into the Ile of Iona, now called Colmekill, there buried
it in kinglie wise. Dongard was thus slaine, in the fift y&eacute;ere of his reigne, after the birth

prince of disposition indifferent either to peace or warre, though in the beginning of his
reigne he shewed himselfe more desirous of peace than of warres, by reason the state of the
common-wealth so required, considering how things stood not all in the best order, through
his predecessors negligence. Dongall therefore desirous of a reformation, appointed men
<note place="marg">The politike rule of Dongall.</note>
of great wisedome and good fame to be iudges and officers vnder him, who in redressing
misorders, in punishing transgressions, &amp; in deciding of all strifes and contentions betwixt
partie &amp; partie, did so well their endeuour, that peace and concord therevpon insuing, the
people recouered peaceable rest and quietnesse, to their no small comfort and contentation.</p>
<p>In this meane while that things passed thus among the Scots, by the procurement of one
Vortigerne, Constantius the eldest sonne of the late deceassed Constantine king of Britains,
<note place="marg">Constantius a moonke elected king of Britaine.</note>
was taken out of an abbeie, where he was shorne a moonke, and aduanced to the kingdome:
but being not meet of himselfe to gouerne, Vortigerne had the whole rule committed to
his hands, wherevpon he first caused the league to be renewed betwixt the Britains, the
Scots, and Picts, and appointed a gard of the same Scots and Picts to be attendant on the
kings person: in the end also he procured some of them to murther the king, and after
<note place="marg">Vortigerns treason.</note>

<note place="marg">Constantius murdered.</note>
put all the said Scots and Picts to death, as well the giltie as the vngiltie, and finallie made
himselfe king, as in the historie of England you shall find more at large expressed.</p>
<p>The Scots and Picts (for displeasure that their countriemen which had beene appointed
to gard the person of Constantius king of the Britains, were maliciouslie circumuented, &amp;
the more part of them wrongfullie executed) made sundrie roades and forraies into the
British borders, neither sparing fire nor swoord where they came. So that the said Vortigerne by a gr&eacute;euous report informed h&eacute;ereof, caused an armie with all sp&eacute;ed to be leuied,
and appointed Guitellus the prince of Wales to haue the leading thereof against the enimies:
whilest he (doubting least the people would not be ruled by him, for that it was knowen
how he would haue made awaie Constantines children) kept him about London, &amp; durst
not commit himselfe so much to the sight of a multitude, as to go foorth in that iournie in

caused to be hanged, as condemned for robbers and pillers of the countrie afore anie ouerture of warre was denounced. Wherevpon such other as escaped by flight, and had s&eacute;ene

<p>With such and sundrie other the like woords the Britains being imboldened, as might
well app&eacute;ere by their change of countenances, Guitellus therevpon remooued his campe
more neere vnto his enimies, so that at the first and for certeine daies togither, there chanced
onelie diuers skirmishes betwixt the parties, as occasion serued. But at length the one
being sore mooued against the other, they ioine in a pight field. The beginning of which

battell was verie fierce and doubtfull. For on that side where Dongall the Scotish king

which danger Galanus the Pictish king quicklie perceiuing, foorthwith prouided remedie:
for taking with him certeine bands out of his owne battell, willing the residue to stand to it
manfullie, and in no wise to giue ground to the enimie, he himselfe with the said bands
fetched a compasse about, and set vpon the backs of them that so had ouermatched the
Scots.</p>
<p>This sudden chance sore disordered the Britains, and immediatlie the Scots incouraged

themselues, most humblie crauing mercie at their enimies hands. There were slaine in this
battell aboue twentie thousand of the Britains, togither with their generall Guitellus, and a
great number of other of the nobilitie. There died also of the Scots and Picts, n&eacute;ere hand
foure thousand. The prisoners with the spoile of the field were diuided by appointment of
the kings amongst the souldiers. Which doone, they marched foorth into the countrie to
conquere castels and townes, such as stood in their waie.</p>
<p>In the meane time, the Britains being sore discomfited with the ouerthrow, assembled a
councell at London, there to deuise by what meanes they might best defend their countrie
from the imminent danger in the which it now stood. Vortigerne as one giltie in conscience,
doubted least through want of good wils in his commons, he should not be able to withstand the mightie inuasion of his enimies, whervpon he was minded to haue auoided the
realme, but there were of his councell that aduised him to the contrarie, holding, that better
it was for him to trie the vttermost point of fortunes hap, than with dishonor so to y&eacute;eld at
the first blow of hir froward hand, considering the abundance of treasure which he had in
store, wherewith he might wage souldiers and men of warre out of Germanie &amp; other
places, in number sufficient to match with his enimies. This counsell as the best was followed,
<note place="marg">Vortigerne is counselled to send for aid into Germanie.</note>
and messengers with commission &amp; sufficient instructions sent with all sp&eacute;ed into Germanie,
to reteine a number of Saxons, and to bring them ouer into Britaine, to serue against the
Scots and Picts in wages with Vortigerne.</p>
<p>At the same time there were amongst those Saxons two brethren, descended by rightfull
linage of the princes of that nation, who being reputed for valiant capteins, appointed with
the British commissaries for a certeine summe of monie to take vp their prescribed number
of men, &amp; to receiue charge of them as coronels, aswell for their conuaie ouer into Britaine,
as also for their seruice there, after their arriual. The one of these two brethren was called
<note place="marg">Hengist and Horsus reteined in seruice with Vortigerne.</note>
Hengist or Engist, and the other Horsus, who hauing their appointed numbers once filled,
conteining about ten thousand souldiers in the whole, they bestowed them abroad in thirtie

y&eacute;ere after Christ, as our histories doo affirme: where they were receiued with great ioy

passed ouer the riuer of Humber, before the Scots or Picts had knowledge that anie such
people were come in support of the Britains to bid them battell. They being therefore
amazed with the strangenesse of the thing, some of them fled into the inner parts of their
countrie, &amp; other that made but sorie shift, fell into the hands of the Saxons, who to begin
their enterprise with bloud, slaie all such as they could laie hands vpon, without anie respect
of person. Great was the slaughter by them committed in all those parties where they
passed, namelie about the riuer of Tine. And when they had made an end there, they
entred into Northumberland, and so into the dales aboue Berwike, next adioining vnto
Pictland, destroieng all before them with fire and swoord.</p>
<p>The Pictish king in the meane time had sent vnto Dongall the king of Scots to come
<note place="marg">The king of Picts sendeth for aid vnto the Scotish king.</note>
with all sp&eacute;ed to support him against the dreadfull inuasion of the enimies, whose force being now increased with a power of Saxons, would woorke much misch&eacute;efe, if the same were
not the more sp&eacute;edilie in the beginning repressed: but hearing that the Saxons and Britains
dailie approched, he thought not good to tarie for the comming of the Scots, but hasted
foorth with his owne power to incounter his aduersaries, and rashlie giuing battell, he was

<note place="marg">The Saxons won praise, and the Britains noted of cowardize.</note>
ouercome, and thereby lost no small number of his people. In this conflict the Saxons wan
them a great name for their high valiance, where contrarilie the Britains got them no
small note of giltie cowardize, fighting so faintlie, that their capteins had much adoo to
cause them to k&eacute;epe their ground, being readie still to haue run awaie: which their faintnesse of stomach being noted of Hengist, euen then put him in no small confidence that
it should be an easie matter for him to conquere them at his pleasure, when time and
occasion might serue thereto.</p>
<p>The Pictish nation hauing receiued this grieuous ouerthrow at the hands of their cruell
enimies, sent againe an other ambassage vnto the Scotish king Congall, to signifie to him
by way of lamentation, what losse had happened to them by that most cruell people the
Saxons void of all religion and mercie, and what mischiefe by the same people was intended,
aswell against Scots as Picts, vnto the great danger of the vtter ruine of both nations, if the
<note place="marg">The Picts eftsoones solicit the Scots for aid.</note>
enimies in time were not resisted. They that were sent, declared all this matter unto king
Congall, and as they had in commission, besought him of sp&eacute;edie succors. Congall not
onlie moued for the harms and losses of the Picts his friends and alies, but also much more
for the likelihood of the imminent danger and perill towards himselfe and his owne people,
determined sp&eacute;edilie to go with all his power, and to ioine with the Picts, as fullie resolued
to preuent that mischiefe which was like to follow, if the violent rage of the enimies were

Scots and Picts being striken with feare to behold so great a multitude, as the like had not
b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene in those parties manie a day before, they stale away and secrctlie hid themselues
in the next woods. But the kings, to giue example to other, caused them that were thus
stolne away, to be sought out, &amp; brought againe into the campe, where they were hanged
in open sight of all the armie.</p>
<p>The Saxons &amp; Britains also vpon the approch of their enimies gathered their companies

togither, &amp; maintenantlie herewith the Saxons incouraged with such comfortable speach as
Hengist vttered amongest them, required to haue battell without delay: whose example the
Britains following, shewed themselues also right willing therevnto. Congall the Scotish king
perceiuing the enimies to make readie for battell, went likewise amongst his folks, and exhorted them in best wise he could, to play the men. The like also did Galanus the Pictish
king amongest his people, omitting nothing that might incourage them to fight manfullie.
After this, the battell on both sides comming forward to ioine, the arrowes and darts flue
freshlie betwixt them, but neither part minding to give place for all the shot, at length they
ioined at handblowes, first the Britains in the right wing with the Scots in the left wing;
but the Britains not able long to indure against the force of the Scots, gaue backe and fled.
<note place="marg">The Britains fl&eacute;e.</note>

<note place="marg">A great tempest.</note>
In the meane while came a great shower of raine, mixt with such a tempest of haile, that
the hardiest there wished himselfe thence, the storme beating so fast vpon them, that
one might vnneath s&eacute;e an other, so that the Scotishmen and Picts wist not whether
were better to pursue the Britains that fled, or to keepe their places.</p>

closed themselues togither and drew neere vnto their chiefeteins standard. Finallie the tempest no sooner began to ceasse, but the Scots and Picts leauing their order of battell, fell to
follow the chase of the Britains, supposing the victorie had beene wholie theirs. Which the
Saxons (now after that the element began to cleare vp) plainelie perceiuing, by commandement of Hengist their generall, assailed the Scots and Picts here and there dispersed about
the spoile and slaughter of the Britains, and made such murther of them on euerie side
where they found them, that pitie it was to behold. Those that escaped by flight, neuer
staied till they were gotten into places farre inough out of danger. This was a blacke day
with the Scots and Picts. Neither was it verie ioifull to the Britains, of whome no small
number died in the place by the enimies sword lamentable to s&eacute;e. Hengist hauing thus
gotten the victorie, withdrew to Yorke, leauing those countries betwixt Tine and Tw&eacute;ed in
<note place="marg">Hengist purposed at the first to make conquest of the Britains.</note>
the enimies handes, of purpose ceassing from further indamaging them, that the Britains
might haue neighbours whome to feare: for that (as he thought) should make much for
his purpose, alreadie hauing determined to make a conquest of this Ile.</p>
<p>When summer then was well n&eacute;ere passed, he placed his souldiers in harbrough to lodge
<note place="marg">Hengist returneth to London.</note>
for the winter season, and went himselfe to London, where he counselled Vortigerne to send
of his owne people to the borders of his enimies, to keepe the same from their inuasions
till the next spring, against which time he promised to cause such notable numbers of his
<note place="marg">Hengist offereth to send for more aid into Germanie.</note>
countriemen to come to his aid, as should suffice not onelie to vanquish the Scotishmen and
Picts, but also vtterlie to destroy both the nations, or at least wise to driue them foorth of
the whole countrie. This offer vnto some of the nobilitie was not greatlie liked, as euer
<note place="marg">Hengists offers misliked of some of the nobilitie of Britaine.</note>
suspecting that which followed, least in time to come Hengist should seeke the dominion of
the realme in placing his owne people, and expelling the former inhabitants. But Vortigerne did not onelie giue him most hartie thanks for those his offers, but also shewed by
the maner of his interteinement, which he vsed towards him, that he thought he could not
<note place="marg">The honor shewed vnto Hengist by Vortigerne.</note>

<note place="marg">Britains sent to defend the borders, are distressed.</note>
doo vnto him too much honor for such notable seruice as he had doone alreadie, and trusted
he should doo hereafter. According to Hengists aduise also, there was a crue of men of
warre of Britains sent vnto the borders to the number of fiue thousand, who shortlie after
their comming thither, were quicklie dispatched and made awaie in sundrie skirmishes and

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"incounters"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"142"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

incounters with the Scots and Picts, that assailed those places which they were appointed to
defend.</p>
<p>Shortlie after was sent thither also an other companie, double in number to the first, to
reuenge the deaths of their fellowes; but they finding fortune as froward vnto them as the
former had doone before, sped much-what a like, for in sundrie conflicts diuers of them
being slaine, and diuers other by treason of the borderers themselues deliuered captiue into
the aduersaries hands, the residue that was left, perceiuing in what danger they stood,
sithence they might not trust their owne countriemen, returned backe into the inner parts
of the land, and so left the borders altogether vnfurnished. In this meane while a new
<note place="marg">A new power of Saxons commeth ouer into Britaine.</note>
supplie of fiue thousand Saxons, with their wiues and children, came ouer into this land,
in eighteene hoies, and amongest other came Hengists wife and his daughter the ladie Roxena.
Shortlie after king Vortigerne gaue vnto Hengist &amp; his Saxons a great part of the countrie
called Lindseie, with a castell of great strength called Thongcastre. Some haue written
that Hengist required of Vortigerne so much ground as he might compas with an oxe hide,
and hauing that granted, he tooke a mightie oxe hide, and cut it into small thongs, and so
compassing about a right strong plot of ground with those thongs line wise, began there the
foundation of a castell, which tooke name of those thongs, wherewith the plot of ground
<note place="marg">Thwang castell, or Th&omacr;gcastell.</note>

<note place="marg">The Saxons first inhabited in Lindseie.</note>
was first measured, and so was it called Thong-castell. But vpon what consideration so
euer it tooke that name, certeine it is by record of all the Scotish histories, that there the
Saxons first inhabited after their entring into Britaine.</p>
<p>When Hengist had set things in order for the placing of his people there in dwellings
(appointed them by Vortigerne) according as seemed best vnto his politike head and craftie
forecast, he tooke foorth the souldiers and men of warre, ordered vnder certeine capteins
and officers of bands, and led them forward by slow iournies as it were staieng for the comming of the Britains. Vortigerne had gathered as then an huge host of his subiects, and
appointed his generall lieutenant ouer them his sonne <emph>Vortigerne</emph>*, a yoong man of great

force and valiancie, but so that he should be ordered in all things by the aduise and discretion of Hengist, whose authoritie for the warres he commanded chieflie to be followed.</p>
<p>When both the armies of Saxons and Britains were met togither, Hengist led them ouer
the riuers of Humber and Tine, marching directlie towards the place where he thought the
enimies laie. The Scotish and Pictish kings, hauing knowledge of such preparation made
by the Britains, they gathered their powers togither, to the number of 60000 men, furnished with prouision of vittels for a long time. But before their comming to the riuer of
Tine, vpon knowledge had that the Saxons and Britains were passed the same, they made
streight towards them, in purpose to haue giuen battell without longer protracting of time:
howbeit comming to the place where they were lodged, they found them so stronglie incamped, that no aduantage could be perceiued which waie they might be constreined to
raise and come foorth of their strength to receiue battell vpon some euen ground, which
Hengist of purpose for a time s&eacute;emed to deferre.</p>
<note place="marg">Hengist prolongeth time to giue battell.</note>
<p>Betwixt them also and the armies of the two kings there was a vallie, in the botome full
of mires and marish grounds, which the Scotishmen &amp; Picts must n&eacute;edes passe, yer they
could find meanes to doo anie notable displeasure to the enimies. Wherefore at length they
determined with turfe and fagots to make passage ouer those mires. Which being accomplished in the night following, the next morning they passed ouer and got them vnto certeine
hilles lieng right ouer against the Saxon and British campes, some of them taking their
lodgings vpon the brow or front of an hill so n&eacute;ere to the lodgings of their enimies, that they
might throwe a dart into their campe: and hereof they tooke no small occasion to worke
a feat against their aduersaries, to their great annoiance and vexation.</p>
<p>There was growing in that place, where they were thus incamped, verie much of that
kind of heath or ling, which the Scotishmen call hadder. Of which heath or hadder, they
gathered a great quantitie togither, and binding it in bundels like vnto fagots, in the night

season they set the same on fire, tumbling it downe the hill, on that side where the Saxons
laie. The wind in that instant being somewhat aloft, caused these bundels of ling to blase
and burne vehementlie, and hereto standing that waies foorth, droue the flame so streinablie
amongest the tents and cabins of the Saxons, that the fire catching in the straw and twigs
which they had couched togither vnder them in st&eacute;ed of beds, increased the feare amongst the
souldiors woonderfullie, by reason that the blasing bundels of the ling or hadder, still comming downe the hill vpon them, seemed as though the same had fallen from aboue, and euen
foorth of the heauen it selfe.</p>
<p>Great was the tumult and noise throughout the whole campe, with such roring of beasts,
<note place="marg">The tumult and feare raised in the campe of the Saxons.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Hyperbole.</emph></note>
and running vp and downe both of them and of the horsses which were there in the campe,
that if heauen and earth had gone togither, there could not haue b&eacute;ene a more terrible noise
nor clamor. At length, when the souldiors had doone what they could to quench the fire, and
to appease the trouble, not without some vprore and disorder raised on each side, they got
them with their armor and weapons foorth into the next field, which Hengist himselfe perceiuing (hauing first doone what he could to stay them) inuironed with a companie of his
choisest men of warre, he got him vp vnto a little hill next adioining, and there gaue knowledge
<note place="marg">Hengist calleth his people togither.</note>
by the sound of a trumpet that all his people should draw thither vnto him. After this, when
they were come togither, he disposed them in order of battell with all diligence, abiding for the
spring of the daie, to vnderstand more certeinlie the meaning of his enimies.</p>
<p>The Scots and Picts supposing the enimies to be farre disordered, by reason of the fire descended downe from the hilles, fullie determined to assaile them in their camps: but vpon their
approch to the same, perceiuing how the Saxons were gotten foorth, and stood readie in good
order of battell, minding to defend their ground, both the kings thought it best to tarie till the
morning, yer they made anie exploit, for doubt of perils that might befall thereof. In the
breake of the daie Congall came amongst his people, exhorting them to remember their 
<note place="marg">Congals exhortation to the Scots.</note>
woorthie elders, and by their example to choose rather to die in defense of their countrie &amp; ancient liberties, than by cowardize to saue a dishonested life, which (if their chance was to be
vanquished) they should passe in great thraldome and miserie. The Pictish king also with
like words incouraged his men to doo valiantlie. Neither was Hengist slow in 
<note place="marg">Hengist exhorteth the Saxons to fight manfullie.</note>
persuading his Saxons to plaie the men, that obteining the victorie they might deliuer themselues
from terror of all enimies from thencefoorth in Britaine.</p>
<p>Whilest he was thus exhorting his people, the Scots and Picts with great force and violence

<note place="marg">The Saxons in danger to haue the ouerthrow.</note>

<note place="marg">An ambush of thr&eacute;e thousand men.</note>
began to giue the charge vpon him, which whilest the Saxons and Britains went about to defend, they were beaten downe by heaps so fiercelie on ech side, that the discomfiture had
light vpon them foorthwith, had not Hengist by sound of trumpet called foorth about three
thousand fresh men to their succors, which he had placed in an ambush a little before the
spring of the daie within a thicke groue of wood, fast by his campe, appointing them to remaine there in a readinesse, to come at his call, vpon what danger soeuer happened. These
most fiercelie setting vpon the backes of the Scots, brought them streight out of all order: for
they being occupied with the other Saxons before, and now assailed of these behind, they
had vnneath roome for anie aduantage to turne their weapons. In the meane time the Picts
being matched with the Britains did put them to flight, and chased them out of the field, not
<note place="marg">The Britains put to flight by the Picts.</note>
ceassing to pursue them in the chase, till they came to a riuer in the which a great number
of them were drowned, as they ieoparded to passe ouer the same, and to saue themselues by
swimming. On the other side, the Scots being sore handled by the Saxous, both before and
<note place="marg">The Scots forced to flie.</note>
behind, were at the length constreined to giue ground and breake foorth by flight, &amp; so to
escape the cruell hands of the enimies. Manie were slaine in the chase, and some taken prisoners. The residue getting away, fled streight to the Picts: but Congall himselfe, through

<p>The Picts returning from the chase, and vnderstanding how the Saxons had giuen the Scots

determined not to abide their comming at that time. And so night approching yer the Saxons had
<note place="marg">The policie of the Picts to escape out of danger.</note>
got sight of them, order was giuen by commandement of their king, that all their carriage,
and a great quantitie of logs and fagots, should be placed and piled togither before them, and
in the darke of the night to be set on fire, which being executed according to the appointment,
when the fire was once kindled, the Picts with the Scots which were got vnto them, departed
as secretlie as they might, and staied not to make awaie, till they were farre inough out of the
danger of the Saxons. Hengist hauing thus got the victorie, and perceiuing no enimie abroad
to bid him battell, mustered his men, and found that he had lost in this iournie as good as foure
thousand of one and other. After this, h&eacute;e withdraweth to Yorke, and leauing his armie
there, went himselfe vnto London, where h&eacute;e was receiued with ioy inough by king Vortigerne.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, vpon knowledge that Aurelius Ambrose, and Vter, the sonnes of king 
<note place="marg">Aurelius Ambrose &amp; Vter, sons to king Constantine.</note>

<note place="marg">The Saxons placed in Kent.</note>
Constantine prepared to come ouer with a mightie armie of Armorike Britains, and other Frenchmen,
to claime the crowne of Britaine, as lawfullie descended to them from their father: the Saxons
were sent for out of the north parts, and had dwellings appointed vnto them in Kent, to be at hand
if n&eacute;ed were to resist anie such attempted inuasion. But shortlie after, for a policie, Hengist
caused it to be bruited abroad, that the Scots and Picts meant eftsoones to inuade the British
confines, &amp; therefore was there an other power of Saxons called into the land, and placed in the
<note place="marg">A new power of Saxons came ouer with their captein Occa.</note>
north parts, to defend the same against the Scots and Picts. Occa the sonne of Hengist had
the leading of these Saxons, who brought them ouer, being ten thousand men of warre, in fiftie
plaits, and fiftie hoies. They brought with them also their wiues and children, and setled
themselues in the north parts betwixt the riuer of Humber and the borders of the Pictish dominions. And euen then it began to take the name of Northumberland, which is as you wold
<note place="marg">Northumberland when it first began to be so called.</note>

<note place="marg">Vortigerne marieth Hengists daughter.</note>

<p>Shortlie after, Vortigerne forsaking his lawfull wife, maried the ladie Roxena or Rowen,
Hengists daughter, to the high offense of God, and great displeasure of his subiects. And in
the meane time, Occa not attempting anie exploit against the Scots and Picts, rather sought to
get into his hands all the fortresses betwixt Tine and Humber, euen from the east sea to the
west: which his purposed intent he greatlie aduanced, winning castels and fortresses there in
those parties, some by force, and some by surrender: and amongst other places of importance,
he first got possession of Yorke, and feigning accusations against manie of the nobles and
<note place="marg">Yorke in posession of Hengist.</note>
gentlemen, surmising that they would betraie the countrie vnto the Scots &amp; Picts, h&eacute;e put
diuerse of them to death, some secretlie, and others openlie, as conuict of such offenses as were
forged and laid against them.</p>

<note place="marg">The Britains require aid of the Scots and Picts against the Saxons.</note>
Vortigerne from his kinglie seat, and placed his sonne Vortimer in his roome, which being doone,
ambassadors were sent both vnto the Scots and Picts, to require their aid and support against
the cruell oppression of the Saxons, who sought not onelie by craftie meanes and fraudulent
waies to atteine the dominion of the whole Ile, but also to extinguish and vtterlie subuert the
faith of Christ, and the vse of his religion throughout the same. Therefore they earnestlie desired the Scotish and Pictish kings, to assist them against such common enimies as had b&eacute;ene
called into the realme, not by publike consent of the nobles, but onlie by the priuate commandement and ordinance of Vortigerne, to helpe as well toward the subduing of the Scots and
Picts, as also to represse all commotions of the Britains, which they might happilie raise against
him for his wicked tyrannie vsed amongst them, as his guiltie conscience might put him still

honor and worship of their hellish gods, to the great hrror and terrible offense of the

beholders consciences; but also sought by all meanes they could deuise, how to destroie and
quench vtterlie the faith of our Sauiour Christ in all places where they might get the vpper hand.</p>
<p>He promised therefore to imploie his whole puissance to recouer out of the enimies hands
all such countries as laie betwixt the frontiers of his dominion and the riuer of Humber,
and further to aid the Britains to driue them quite out of the Ile, if the Britains would 
<note place="marg">Vpon what conditions Congall couenanted to support the Britains.</note>
assure him, from thencefoorth neuer to make claime, title nor interest, to any of the countries
aforesaid, lieng betwixt the said riuer of Humber and the confines of his realme; but to
leaue the same in the hands of the Scotishmen and Picts, to haue hold and inioy for euermore in quiet: which to performe, the ambassadors had (amongest other things) alreadie
promised in name of all the British nation, as a recompense or m&eacute;ed to haue the support
and succors of the Scots. The like answer the same ambassadors receiued of the Pictish
king, and returning therewith vnto Vortimer, declared afore him and his councell how they
had sped.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, for the more and better assurance of all promises, couenants and articles
passed betwixt the Scotishmen, Picts, and Britains, there was an amitie and bond of peace
<note place="marg">A league concluded betwixt Scots Picts and Britains.</note>
now renewed, ratified and established, according to the tenor of the ancient league, which had
b&eacute;ene concluded in times past betwixt them, with some new conditions of agr&eacute;ement included in the same: all old iniuries being ended and quieted clearelie betwixt them, so that no
cause of grudge, or displeasure might b&eacute;e thought to remaine in remembrance. The first
enterprise put in execution after the concluding of this league, was made by the Scots against
<note place="marg">The Scots inuade the borders of Northumberland.</note>
Occa and his Saxons, which (as partlie ye haue heard) had nestled themselues betwixt the
riuers of Tine and Humber.</p>
<p>Against those Scots, as they were verie earnestlie occupied in ouerthrowing castels and
towers, with slaughter of such Saxons as stood at defense, Occa commeth into the field with
an armie readie to incounter with them, but perceiuing the multitude of his enimies to be such,
as he doubted least he should not be well able to match with them, he staied a while from
giuing the onset: but in the end perceiuing he could not retire backe but to his great disaduantage, he boldlie gaue signe to his people to set vpon their enimies: which they 
<note place="marg">The Saxons incounter with the Scots.</note>

<note place="marg">The Saxons vanquished by the Scots.</note>
fiercelie executing, it was hard to tell for a while to whether part the victorie would incline. But
at length the Saxons not able to susteine the force of the Scots, ouerpressing them with
multitude, began to giue backe: which Occa perceiuing, did what he could to hem them in
from running awaie, but yet notwithstanding all that he could doo, feare at length ouercomming regard to their capteins commandement, shame of rebuke was quite set apart, and so
they tooke them to their feet, and fled awaie so fast as they might, the Scots pursuing after
them amaine.</p>
<p>Occa yet escaped with diuerse of his nobles, and comming to the mouth of Humber,
<note place="marg">Occa fl&eacute;eth by sea into Kent.</note>
got a ship, and sailed foorth in the same with great danger, till at length he arriued within
the Thames. The slaughter of the Saxons vpon the discomfiture was great, speciallie in
the chase, for the Scotishmen calling to remembrance that they had to doo with infidels, and
with the enimies of the christian faith, were so eger vpon them, that they saued few or none
that fell into their hands. About the same time was Vortimer entered into Kent against 
<note place="marg">The Saxons vanquished by Britains and expelled out of Kent.</note>
Hengist and his Saxons there, and incountring with them in battell, slue ten thousand of them, and
chased the residue foorth of that countrie. Thus Kent returned vnto the Britains, and
the countries beyond Humber northwards vnto the Scots and Picts, according to the tenour of the league before mentioned.</p>
<p>Hengist and his sonne Occa (who a little before this battell in Kent was come vnto his father)
with the residue of them that escaped, hasted with all sp&eacute;ed toward Northumberland, in purpose to remaine in that countrie till they had recouered their strength by some power to be
sent ouer vnto them out of their owne countrie: but being repelled with no small slaughter
from thence by the Scots and Picts, they withdrew vnto the mouth of Humber, where getting

dispersed abroad here and there in this Ile, as fortune then best serued. Vortimer hauing got
<note place="marg">Vortimer vseth the victorie modestlie.</note>
the victorie, as before is mentioned, vsed not the same verie cruellie, for taking onelie from the
Saxons which were taken prisoners their armor and weapon, he suffered them to depart into
their countrie: other of the same nation being but husbandmen, and as it were poore
laborers of the ground, he permitted to tarie in the countrie with their wiues &amp; children, as seruants vnto the Britains.</p>
<p>After this, Vortimer gaue order for the reparing of churches, and restoring of the christian
religion into the state of the former puritie thereof, as then sore decaied, partlie through the
euill example taken by dailie conuersation amongst the Saxons, and partlie also by the infectiue heresie of the Pelagians, as then mightilie spred ouer the most part of Britaine. At
<note place="marg">The heresie of the l'elagians.</note>
length the said Vortimer through treason of his stepmother Roxena was poisoned, and died.
Then was Vortigerne againe restored to the rule of the kingdome, first forced by oth to promise neuer to aid the Saxons, nor to receiue by way of aid anie forreine people into
the realme. Vortigerne then restored thus vnto the crowne, shewed such diligence in
causing due administration of iustice without rigor to be executed, and prouision made for
the resisting of all inuasions that might be attemted by anic forreine power, that his praise
was great amongst all his subiects, who to shew their good willes likewise towards him as to
their naturall prince, were not slacke in honoring him aswell by gifts and presents, as by all
other maner of waies. He found meanes also to renew the league with the Scots and Picts,

got possession of the more part of Britaine, so that the Britains were constreined to flie into
Wales, whither also Vortigerne fled, and remained there a certeine time, till at length Aurelius Ambrosius, and Vter, the sonnes of king Constantine came ouer out of little Britaine, and besieging Vortigerne in a castell, burnt him with the house and all, when they

could not otherwise come by him, according to that which Merline the British soothsaier had
prophesied before. It is folishlie supposed that this Merline was got by a spirit of that kind
which are called <emph>Incubi,</emph> that is to vnderstand, such as conueieng mans s&eacute;ed from him (and
therewith by illusion taking vpon them the shape and figure of man) doo lie with women,
and vse them after the maner of carnall copulation.</p>
<p>&para; In this place Hector Boetius by the way reciteth a like tale or two, of such illusions of
<note place="marg">Illusions of spirits.</note>
spirits, wrought not long before his time in Scotland, which somwhat abridging the same we
haue here infarced. In the y&eacute;ere 1480, saith he, it chanced as a Scotish ship departed out of
<note place="marg">A tale of a woman abused with a spirit.</note>
the Forth towards Flanders, there rose a woonderfull great tempest of wind and weather, so
outragious, that the maister of the ship with other the mariners woondered not a little what the
matter ment, to s&eacute;e such weather at that time of the yeere, for it was about the middest of
<note place="marg">About saint Barnab&eacute;es day.</note>
summer. At length when the furious pirrie &amp; rage of winds still increased, in such wise that
all those within the ship looked for present death, there was a woman vnderneath the hatches,
called vnto them aboue, and willed them to throw hir into the sea, that all the residue by Gods
grace might yet be saued: and therevpon told them, how she had bene hanted a long time with
a spirit, dailie comming vnto hir in mans likenesse, and that euen as then he was with hir,
vsing his filthie pleasure after the maner of carnall copulation. In the ship there chanced
also to be a priest, who by the maisters appointment going downe to this woman, and
finding hir like a most wretched and desperate person, lamenting hir great misfortune and
miserable estate, vsed such wholsome admonitions and comfortable aduertisements, willing
hir to repent and hope for mercie at the hands of God, that at length she s&eacute;eming right penitent
for hir gr&eacute;euous offenses committed, and fetching sundrie sighs euen from the bottome of
hir heart, being witnesse (as should appeare) of the same, there issued foorth of the pumpe
of the ship a foule and euill fauored blacke cloud, with a mightie terrible noise, flame, smoke
and stinke, which presentlie fell into the sea. And suddenlie thervpon the tempest ceassed,

and the ship passing in great quiet the residue of hir iournie, arriued in safetie at the place
whither she was bound.</p>
<p>Not long before the hap h&eacute;ereof, there was in like manner a yoong man dwelling in
<note place="marg">A young man haunted with a spirit.</note>
Gareoth, within a village there, not passing 14 miles from Aberdine, verie faire &amp; comelie
of shape, who declared by waie of complaint vnto the bishop of that diocesse, how there was
a spirit which haunted him in shape of a woman, so faire and beautifull a thing, that he neuer
saw the like, the which would come into his chamber at nights, and with pleasant intisements
allure him to haue to doo with hir, &amp; that by no maner of means he could be rid of hir. The
bishop like a wise man aduised him to remooue into some other countrie, and to giue himselfe
to fasting and praier, so to auoid his hands of that wicked spirit. The yoong man following the bishops counsell, within a few daies was deliuered from further temptation.</p>
<p>About the same time also, there was in the countrie of Mar, a yoong gentlewoman of excellent beautie, and daughter vnto a noble man there, refusing sundrie wealthie mariages offered to hir by hir father, and other friends. At length she prooued with child, and being rigorouslie compelled by hir parents to tell who was the father, she confessed that a certeine
yoong man vsed nightlie to come vnto hir, and kept hir companie, and sometimes in the day
also, but how or from whence he came, or by what meanes he went awaie, she was not able
to declare. Hir parents not greatlie crediting hir woords, laid diligent watch, to vnderstand
what he was that had defiled their house: and within thr&eacute;e daies after, vpon signification
giuen by one of the maidens, that the fornicator was at that verie instant with their daughter,
incontinentlie therevpon, making fast the doores, they enter the chamber with a great manie
of torches and lights, where they find in their daughters armes a foule monstrous thing, verie
horrible to behold. H&eacute;ere a number comming hastilie in, to behold this euill fauored sight,
amongst other there was a priest of verie honest life, not ignorant (as was thought) in knowledge of holie scripture.</p>
<p>This priest (all other being afraid) and some of them running their waies, began to recite
the beginning of Saint Johns gospell, and comming to these woords, "Verbum caro factum est,"
suddenlie the wicked spirit making a verie sore and terrible roaring noise, flue his waies,
taking the roofe of the chamber awaie with him, the hangings and couerings of the bed being
also burnt therewith. The gentlewoman was yet preserued, and within thr&eacute;e or foure daies
after was deliuered of such a mishapen thing, as the like before had not b&eacute;ene seene, which
the midwiues and women, such as were present at hir labor, to auoid the dishonor of hir
house, immediatlie burnt in a great fire, made in the chamber for the same intent. &para; Thus much
out of Hector Boetius, which, with more, he hath written to prooue that all is not feined which
is written of the illusions of diuels and euill spirits, the credit whereof I leaue with the author.</p>
<p>Now to returne where I left touching Aurelius Ambrose. Ye shall vnderstand, that he
<note place="marg">Aurelius Ambrose purposeth to make warres against the Saxons.</note>
hauing once subdued and dispatched his aduersarie Vortigerne, determined to make warres
against Hengist and his Saxons, to prooue if his chance might be to recouer the realme out
of their hands, and so to restore againe the christian religion. But first yer he attempted anie
exploit against the enimies, he sent ambassadors both vnto Congall the Scotish king, and also
<note place="marg">Ambassadors sent vnto the Scots and Picts to require their aid against the Saxons.</note>
vnto one Loth a towardlie yoong gentleman, and of verie comelie personage, as then reigning
among the Picts, requiring them both to aid him in so necessarie an enterprise as he had in hand
against the enimies of Christ and his religion. Wherevpon both these kings, weieng with
themselues the dutie of all christian princes, in respect of the aduancement of the cause of faith,
and suppressing of ethnike idolatrie, promised their helpe to the vttermost of their powers
<note place="marg">The Scots and Picts promise to aid the Britains against the Saxons.</note>

<note place="marg">The league renewed betwixt Britains, Picts, and Scots.</note>
against the Saxons, who had in such tyranlike sort subuerted and abolished the christian profession within the British confines. And therefore the old league, according to the articles
and couenants aforetime concluded betwixt the thr&eacute;e nations, was once againe renewed, and
an armie prepared by euerie of them, to meet at a place and day appointed, for the better expedition of this their attempted voiage.</p>
<p>First Aurelius Ambrose, with such power as he brought with him foorth of France, &amp; ioining therevnto a great multitude of those Britains which had escaped the Saxons hands, either

by withdrawing themselues into Wales, or else by conueieng themselues into the countries of
the Scots and Picts, setteth forward toward the Scotish armie. But first calling together those
Britains that he had about him, and going vp to a little hill, where he might be heard of them
all, he made a long oration by waie of complaint, of the great iniuries and cruell practises vsed
<note place="marg">Aurelius Ambrose maketh an oration.</note>
by Hengist, against the linage of king Constantine, and the whole estate of the British common-wealth: also of the horrible persecution made by him and his people the Saxons, against
the professors of the christian religion. All which matter he handled in woords so pithilie, his
talke yet sauoring of the Romane eloquence, that the minds of the souldiers being kindled
therewith, required nothing but battell, as men not doubting but by his wise and politike conduct to atchiue some glorious victorie. And to the end all thing might be doone in better
order, according to his appointment, immediatlie they proclamed him king. Which was by
<note place="marg">Aurelius Ambrose proclamed king of Britaine.</note>
account of the Scotish chronicles, in the y&eacute;ere 498, after that Vortigerne with his sonne Vortimer had reigned 17 y&eacute;eres in the whole.</p>
<p>Aurelius in this wise being established king of Britaine passeth foorth with his people, and
within six daies after met with the armies of the Scots and Picts. Generall of the Scots at
<note place="marg">Conranus generall of the Scots.</note>
that time was one Conranus brother to king Congall, who was troubled with the gout, so
that he could not come himselfe in person. Loth the Pictish king was there himselfe amongst
<note place="marg">Loth king of the Picts.</note>
his people, verie desirous to shew some proofe of his manlie prowesse and manhood. Aurelius Ambrose shewed all the honor that might be deuised, as well to the one as to the other of
those two nations, promising to requite them with as much friendship when time and occasion
should craue the like assistance. These three mightie armies therefore being thus assembled,
marched foorth towards a place called Mahesbell, where they vnderstood that Hengist with
<note place="marg">Mahesbell.</note>
his power as then did soiorne. Where when both the camps were pitched, and one lieng not
farre from the other: at the first certeine light skirmishes were procured by both parts betwixt the light horssemen, wherewith at length being the more prouoked to displeasure, they
come into the field with their whole maine battels, verie fiercelie incountring ech other, so that
<note place="marg">The Albions and Saxons incounter in battell.</note>
(as it app&eacute;ered) their force was not so great, but their mortall hate was euen as much, or
rather more, if the histories saie right.</p>
<p>The Armorike Britains with a new kind of order in their fight, sore troubled the Saxons,
<note place="marg">The Armorike Britains.</note>
in persing their battels, with their men arraied in certeine wards, broad behind and narrow before, wedgewise. The Scots also &amp; Picts bare downe both the wings of the Saxons, in such
manner, that the standards of all the three nations, Scots, Picts, and Britains, were at point almost to m&eacute;et, hauing made waie therevnto through the middest of their enimies. Wherewith
the Saxons (being sore discouraged) began to giue backe; and finallie, notwithstanding all
<note place="marg">The Saxons discomfited.</note>
that Hengist could saie or doo to haue staied them, they fell to running awaie, and fled amaine,
which when he throughlie saw, &amp; perceiued that there was no recouerie, he himselfe (in 
<note place="marg">S&eacute;e more hereof in England.</note>
manner the last man that abode) fled likewise his waies out of the field, with an ambushment of
horssemen about him, but being pursued by Aurelius verie fiercelie, he was run through the
<note place="marg">Hengist is slaine by Aurelius, as the Scotish chronicles sav.</note>
bodie by him with a speare, and so was there slaine out of hand, in the 488 y&eacute;ere of Christ,
and 40 after his comming into this Ile. Howbeit the other of the Saxons conueied his sonne
Occa (being also sore wounded) awaie with them vp into the next mounteins, whither they
fled for their refuge, leauing the dead bodie of his father Hengist in the field, to their high reproch, there to be spoiled and abused of his enimies.</p>
<p>Aurelius Ambrose hauing thus got the vpper hand of his enimies, hasted foorth with all sp&eacute;ed
<note place="marg">Aurelius hasteth fcorth to London.</note>
vnto London, where hauing both the citie and tower deliuered into his hands, he recouered the
whole Iland from the possession of the Saxons: and such of them as were apt men, able to
beare armor, and to serue in the warres, he commanded to depart foorth of the land. The
other that were minded to tarrie behind their fellowes that were thus forced to depart, became
subiects to the Britains, and couenanted to become christians. &para; Thus much haue I written
touching Aurelius Ambrose, according to the report of the Scotish writers, but more h&eacute;ereof
ye may read in the historie of England, where ye shall find this matter set foorth more
at large. For that which we write h&eacute;ere, is but to shew in what sort the Scotish writers

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"149"</fw>-->

make relation of the warres which their nation had with the Saxons, when they began first
to set foot h&eacute;ere in this land.</p>
<p>To our purpose then. In the meane time Aurelius hauing thus recouered the land out of
the Saxons hands, and now remaining at London, did all the honor he could imagine, both
vnto Loth the Pictsh king, and also vnto Conranus generall of the Scotishmen, 
<note place="marg">By support of Scots and Picts Aurelius confesseth he got the victorie of the Saxons.</note>

<note place="marg">The league betwixt Scots, Picts, and Britains is renewed.</note>
acknowledging how that by their aid chieflie he had got the vpper hand of his enimies, and so he
willed to haue it notified amongst his subiects. H&eacute;ereto he caused the league to be renewed
betwixt the Scots, Picts, &amp; Britains, the ancient ordinance for the countries beyond Humber,
being appointed to remaine vnto the Scotishmen and Picts: also that the Saxons should be
reputed common enimies to all the thr&eacute;e nations, and that vpon inuasion made by anie
forren power, the Scots, Picts, and Britains, should aid one another as occasion serued.</p>
<p>This league being concluded with these articles of couenants, was the more stronglie confirmed, by reason of such affinitie and aliance as then also insued. For whereas Aurelius
had two sisters, the one named Anne, and the other Ada, virgins both; Anne being the
<note place="marg">Anne the daughter of Aurelius giuen in mariage vnto Loth king of Picts.</note>

<note place="marg">Ada maried vnto Conranus.</note>
elder, was giuen in mariage vnto king Loth, by whome certeine yeares after he had issue
two sonnes, Mordred, and Walwan or Calwan, with a daughter called Thametes: Ada being the yoonger sister was maried vnto Conranus, generall (as is said) of the Scotish armie.
Howbeit she liued not past two yeares after, but died in trauell of child, which also died
with the mother: and so ended the aliance of Aurelius and Conranus. The Britains being
deliuered through the victorie and means afore rehearsed from the cruell hands of the
Saxons, inioied ioifull peace certeine yeares after, but in the meane time diuers of those
Saxons which were licenced to remaine in Britaine, counterfeiting to become christians, vsed
neuerthelesse to make sacrifice vnto idols, according to the maner of the gentiles, whereof
<note place="marg">Diuers Saxons idolaters are burned.</note>

<note place="marg">The death of Congall.</note>
their priests being accused and condemned, suffered death by fire for that offense, according lie
as the law did then appoint them. Whilest these things were thus in hand, Congall king of
the Scots being worne with long sicknesse, departed this life, and was buried in the Ile of
Iona, otherwise called Colmekill, with all king lie pompe and accustomed ceremonies. He
reigned ouer the Scotishmen about 20 yeares in great fame and glorie.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">AFTER</hi> his deceasse, his brother Conranus with great reioising of all the Scotish nation

was admitted K. in the yeare after the birth of our Sauiour 512, and the 22 of the reigne
of the emperour Anastasius. This Conranus otherwise called Goranus, being established
king, first tooke order that the sonnes of his brother Congall being within age, should be
brought vp in the Ile of Man, vnder the gouernance of certeine wise instructors &amp; schoolemaisters, to be trained in learning and vertuous discipline, according to an ancient ordinance thereof made and enacted. Also doubting least peace and quietnesse, now after
<note place="marg">The earnest diligence of Conranus for maintenance of good orders among his subiects.</note>
long warres, should minister matter to his people of raising some commotion, to the disturbance of all ciuill order &amp; politike gouernement within his realme, he rode as it had b&eacute;ene
in circuit round about the same, making inquirie of all maner of offendors, on whome
he caused due punishment to be executed, without respect either of kith or kin.</p>
<p>And amongest other enormities which he vnderstood to be vsed in maner through all his
countries, this (as he thought) was most grieuous, that the husbandmen and other commons
of the countrie, being euill intreated and misused at the gentlemens hands, durst not complaine, nor procure anie redres; by reason whereof, when they were oppressed, or suffered
anie maner of wrong or iniurie, they were without remedie to haue the same reformed; he
<note place="marg">A goodlie ordinance deuised by Conranus for reliefe of his commons</note>
ordeined therefore, that the names of all such offendors, with the maner of their offenses,
should be secretlie registred in a booke euerie yeare, by certeine inquisitours thereto chosen
and appointed. And if it chanced that those which were thus accused, might afterwards be

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"found"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"150"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

found guiltie before the kings iustices by matter plainelie prooued against them; they should
then be sure to be punished according to the measure of their offenses.</p>
<p>This custome of accusations, commonlie called inditements, continueth euen vnto these
our daies. Conranus himselfe (as is reported) vsed much to be present at assises and
<note place="marg">The king present at assises.</note>
sessions to s&eacute;e the lawes duelie ministred, either else to passe the time in hunting within
some forrest or chase, n&eacute;ere to the place where the iustices sat. Now whilest Conranus
king of Scots thus studied for the good gouernement of his people, Aurelius Ambrose the
<note place="marg">Aurelius Ambrose fell sicke of a consumption.</note>

<note place="marg">Occa and Pascentius returne into Britaine.</note>
king of Britaine fell sicke of a consumption, which brought him to such weakenesse, that
all recouerie of health in him was despaired; whereof Occa and Pascentius sonnes to Hengist
being aduertised, returned with a mightie power of Saxons into Britaine, which (as Hector
Boetius saith) they named at that present Hengists land.</p>
<p>Vter the brother of Aurelius laie also at the same time sore sicke of a flix in the parties
of Wales, so that to auoid dissention that was raised among the Britains, about the appointing of a generall to go against the enimies, Aurelius euen sicke as he was, caused himselfe
to be caried forth in a litter; with whose presence his people were so incouraged, that incountring with the Saxons they wan the victorie, although with such losse on their side,
that Aurelius was glad to take truce for the space of foure moneths, and therewith breaking
vp his campe, went into Winchester, and sent ambassadours vnto the Scotish and Pictish
kings for aid against the time when the truce should expire, which was granted, and so he
prouided for all things readie for the warres against the appointed time of their assemblie.
Occa also sent his brother Pascentius into Germanie for more aid, but as some write, he
was driuen by contrarie winds into Ireland, &amp; getting a great power of men togither there,
he came backe to his brother with the same. But whether he had those men out of Ireland
or Germanie, sure it is that the power of the Saxons was greatlie increased therewith. In
the meane time died Aurelius Ambrose, who was poisoned by a misch&eacute;efous moonke, a
<note place="marg">Aurelius Ambrose departeth this life.</note>
Saxon borne, named Eopa or Copa (as some bookes haue) that tooke vpon him to be
skilfull in physicke, and a moonke by profession. His death was sore lamented of the Britains: but contrariwise, the Saxons reioised greatlie thereof, so that immediatlie after, Occa
with his power inuadeth the Britains, vsing great crueltie in all places wheresoeuer he came.</p>
<p>In the meane time the Scotish and Pictish armies were come forward towards Aurelius,
according to promise made vnto his ambassadours; but when his death was certeinelie
knowen amongest them, the capteins and leaders of both those armies, resolued to returne home
<note place="marg">The Scotish armie returne home againe.</note>
againe, and so they did, for that they doubted in what state and order things should stand
amongest the Britains now after the deceasse of their late king. After the death of Aurelius
Ambrose, his brother Vter was made king of Britaine, and falling in loue with the wife of
Gothlois duke of Cornewall, he did not onelie force hir to lie with him; but also to the end
he might inioy hir the more fr&eacute;elie, he ceassed not to pursue hir husband to rid him out of
the waie, whome at length he tooke within a castell into the which he was fled, &amp; foorthwith
caused him to be executed, surmising mater against him, for that he had forsaken one of the
capteins called Nathaliod, in battell against the Saxons. By the wife of this Gothlois, Vter
<note place="marg">Vter begat Arthur.</note>
had issue the great Arthur, and because he had no legitimat sonne, he appointed that Arthur
should succ&eacute;ed him in gouernement of the realme. Herewith Loth the Pictish king was not
a little mooued, disdaining that Arthur being a bastard, and begot of another mans wife in
adulterie, should be preferred before his sons the rightfull heires of the British kingdome:
and therefore by ambassadours he did what he could to dissuade Vter from making anie
such ordinance. But when he saw that he could not remoue him from his opinion, he
thought best to content himselfe with silence, till the time serued better for his purpose.
At length when the wars were againe renewed betwixt Vter and Occa the Saxon king, Loth
in reuenge of the iniurie doone to him and his children, ioined himselfe to the Saxons, and
was with them at the battell, in which the Britains got the victoriee by the presence of saint
Germane that holie bishop of Auxer, as the Scotish writers make mention. Which battell

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"as"</fw>-->

<pb n="151"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"151"</fw>-->

as the same is set foorth by Hector Boetius, because it touched the state of the Picts, we
haue thought good here to expresse.</p>
<p>It was therefore about the feast of Easter, when the armies came into the field, the Saxons
with the Picts on the one side, &amp; the Britains on the other, of whom no small number (being
either growen to be idolaters through conuersation with the Saxons, either els infected with
the heresie of the Pelagians) euen there in campe, by hearing such good sermons as saint
Germane preached amongest them, were conuerted to the true beliefe, receiuing at the same
<note place="marg">S. Germane preacheth vnto the campe.</note>

<note place="marg">S. Germane leadeth the fore ward.</note>

<note place="marg">Their crie was Alleluia.</note>
time the sacrament of the Lords bodie, togither in companie with other of the faithfull
christians. Finallie when both parties were readie to giue battell, saint Germane tooke vpon
him to haue the leading of the fore ward, wherein he had all the pr&eacute;ests and ecclesiasticall
ministers, giuing commandement, that when he should crie Alleluia, they should all answere
him with one intire voice.</p>
<p>Thus proc&eacute;ed they foorth to the battell, saint Germane bearing the kings standard in the
<note place="marg">S. Germane beareth the kings standard.</note>
fore front, &amp; vpon the approch to the enimies, he with the rest of the pr&eacute;ests crieng with a
lowd voice thrice togither Alleluia, was answered by all the whole host, vttering and crieng
the same crie so wholie togither, that the verie sound thereof caused such an eccho on each
side by reason of the hollow mounteines and cliffes hard by them, that the Saxons amazed
<note place="marg">The Saxons miraculouslie discomfited.</note>
at this doubled noise, and doubting not onelie another power of their enimies to be hidden
priuilie among the hilles which they saw on ech side of them, but also least the verie rocks
&amp; mounteins would haue fallen downe vpon their heads togither with the frame of the
<note place="marg"><emph>Hyperbole.</emph></note>
element, readie (as it s&eacute;emed to them) to breake in sunder, they tooke them to their f&eacute;et in
such dreadfull hast, that their breath was not able to suffice halfe the desire they had to
continue their course. Manie of them made such hast, that running to the next riuer in
hope to passe the same, were drowned therein. To conclude, all of them generallie threw
away both weapon and armour, the more lightlie to make away. Thus through the policie
of that blessed man saint Germane, the victorie remained with king Vter and his Britains,
without anie bloudshed.</p>
<p>Saint Beda making mention of this battell, assigneth the time to be at the first comming
<note place="marg"><emph>Beda</emph> dissenteth from <emph>Hector Boetius</emph> and his authour <emph>Veremond.</emph></note>
of S. Germane into this land, whereas Hector Boetius following Veremond, supposeth it to
be at the second time of his comming hither, which was in the daies of king Vter. But at
what time soeuer this victorie thus chanced, certeine it is, the Britains waxing proud thereof,
nothing regarded the power of the Saxons, nor tooke anie h&eacute;ed for prouision of further
defense; but after that those holie bishops Germane and Seuerus were returned into their
<note place="marg">The Britains giue themselues vnto all kinds of vice and abhominations.</note>

<note place="marg">The threatning of vengeance to succ&eacute;ed vicious liuing.</note>
countrie, they fell to all kinds of gluttenie and excesse, in following onelie their sensuall
lusts and fleshlie concupiscence: which abuses, the bishops and other godlie men lamenting,
ceassed not most earnestlie to reprooue, menacing destruction to the whole countrie, if the
people leauing their wicked liuing and most heinous offenses towards God, did not amend
and repent in due time and space.</p>
<p>Neither were they deceiued herein: for within few yeares after, Occa eftsoones began to
<note place="marg">The Britains receiue a great ouerthrow.</note>

<note place="marg">King Occa slaine.</note>

<note place="marg">The yoonger Occa nephue to the former Occa by his brother Oiscus.</note>

make warres vpon the Britains againe, and gaue them a notable ouerthrow, sleaing of them
to the number of fift&eacute;ene thousand, with their generall Nathaliod. But yet this victorie
was not greatlie pleasant to the Saxons, for in the chase they lost their king the foresaid
Occa, being aduanced a good way off from the residue of his armie, with fiue hundred
horssemen and a few footmen, in pursute of his enimies, which was the onelie cause that as
then the Saxons attempted no further exploit against the Britains. And yet for that they would
not be without a gouernour, they created an other Occa to be their K. the nephue of the
former Occa by his brother Oiscus: and then turned all their force to make warres against
the Picts, for that Loth king of the Picts, contrarie to his oth of credence, had aided the
Britains in the last battell, as by certeine prisoners taken in the same they had perfect vnderstanding.</p>
<p>Occa therfore being fierce of nature, to the end to indamage his enimies the more, sent
<note place="marg">Colgerne or Colgerme a Saxon is sent for by Occa.</note>

the Saxons, to come ouer with a power vnto him into England, promising for recompense
of his trauell and aid against the Picts, to deliuer vnto him all such lands as lay beyond the
water of Humber, which might be recouered out of the hands of the Picts, to inioy vnto
him and his for euer. Colgerne accepting the offer, landed shortlie after in 
<note place="marg">Colgerne landeth in Northumberland.</note>
Northumberland, putting the whole countrie vnto fire and sword. Which cruell dealing caused a great
number of Scots &amp; Picts, which held diuerse castels in that quarter, to come foorth into

slaughter being much increased by the comming of Occa at vnwares vpon them. For he
first taking truce with Vter king of the Britains, hasted with all speed to ioine his power with
Colgerne, after he heard once that he was come on land.</p>
<p>These newes being brought by such as fled away into Galloway and Pictland, caused both
<note place="marg">The king of Scots and Picts raise their powers to resist the Saxons.</note>
the kings, Loth and Conranus in most speedie wise to assemble their forces, and with the
same to march foorthwith towards the Saxons: but being come within sight of them readie
to giue battell, great was the feare and terror of both their hosts, to ioine in fight with such
a number of fierce people, as they saw there before their faces. Which feare arose first
<note place="marg">The Scots and Picts are put in feare of the Saxons valiancie.</note>
through the Britains, of whome no small number was there, in aid of the Scots and Picts
against the Saxons, declaring manie things of the great valure, strength of bodie, and huge
forme of lims of the same Saxons, being so fierce and cruell in fight, as they alledged, that
they were able to put their enimies to flight euen with their grim lookes and terrible countenances. Whereof such feare and terror was spread through both the whole armies, that if
shame had not partlie wrought amongest the men of warre, manie of them would haue
fled their waies before anie battell had b&eacute;ene attempted at all.</p>
<p>The kings perceiuing such discomfiture amongst their men, caused them to assemble 
<note place="marg">The kings cause one to make an oration vnto their people to remoue all feare out of their hearts.</note>
togither, and appointed one such as was thought m&eacute;et for the purpose, to declare vnto them
on their behalfes, how they could not but maruell to vnderstand such feare &amp; lacke of
courage, as appeared generallie through both the armies, considering there was no cause
thereof, they being such a number of able warriours throughlie appointed, and therewithall
led by such gouernours and capteins, as there was no reason why to be doubtfull of victorie,
before they had s&eacute;ene some triall and iust occasion of disaduantage. For as touching the
Saxons, they were no such men but that they might be ouercome well inough, as it might
sufficientlie appeare, both by proofe of such victories as Vortimer the British king had obteined against them; and also Aurelius Ambrose, who had vanquished them in such sort,
that when they durst not eftsoones incounter with him in battell, they found means by poison
to make him awaie.</p>
<p>Then sith the Britains (whome the Scots &amp; Picts so often had subdued) had at sundrie
times vanquished the Saxons, why should they feare in such wise to fight with them in
common defense of their countrie, and reuenge of such iniuries as they had latelie receiued
at their hands, sith the righteous God (as all good men ought to trust) is euer readie to
aduance a righteous quarrell. And where it was bruted amongest them, that the Saxons
were so huge of stature, and mightie of lims, that no force was able to withstand them, it
was certeinelie knowen, that the Scots &amp; Picts were indued with no lesse mightinesse and
strength of bodie than the Saxons; so that if they were not of like stomachs, that rested in
their owne slouthfull cowardize, &amp; not in natures woorke, hauing doone hir part in bestowing hir gifts vpon them touching bodilie force, in such plentious maner, as no other nation
did lightlie anie waies surmount them.</p>
<p>Manie other arguments were alledged and laid foorth to remoue feare out of their hearts,
and to incourage them to fight, insomuch that in the end it appeared the same wrought the

wished effect, in such wise, that they generallie required battell, offering to liue and die at
their capteins f&eacute;et, and to follow them whither soeuer it should please their kings and liege
lords to appoint them. Herewith the kings being satisfied, foorth they march towards their
enimies, whome they found readie to receiue them, and that with such rigorous violence, that
in the end, after great slaughter made on both parts, the Scots and Picts were put to flight, the

their campe. The next day following, the Scotish king with the residue of his armie hasted
away with all sp&eacute;ed towards Galloway, and the Pictish king withdrew into Pictland. The
Saxons vsing the victorie most cruellie, slue all such of the Pictish and Scotish nations as they
met with, in all places betwixt Tine and Tw&eacute;ed. Then did Occa create the forenamed

Colgerme duke of Northumberland, who reparing all such castels and strong houses, as he thought
expedient to haue kept, placed garrisons of souldiers in the same to defend the countrie against
all maner of enimies. After this, Occa turned his power against the Britains, which in the

receiuing a great ouerthrow in battell, Vter the British king was glad with such as might escape

doubt of some long siege, but also all those countries and prouinces which Hengist the first of
the Saxons that reigned as king within the bounds of Albion at anie time, had holden or inioied, and ceassed not after recouerie of the same, to vexe and disquiet the Scots, Britains, and
Picts, with continuall incursions, hoping by such means to k&eacute;epe them still occupied. In the

the yeare after the birth of our Sauior 521, and in the eight&eacute;enth of his owne reigne. After
his deceasse, Loth king of the Picts sent his ambassadours vnto the lords, and other the states
of the British dominions, requiring them, according to the accustomed lawes and ancient ordinances of the realme, to receiue him as king, sith he had maried the sister and heire of the
two brethren Aurelius Ambrose, and Vter, their two last kings, being as then both deceassed,
without leauing behind them anie lawfull issue, by reason whereof their estate was fallen vnto
him, to inioy the same during his life, hauing maried (as is said) their owne naturall and lawfull

lawes of all realmes and countries to descend vnto such issue as he had begot of hir, which was

refused not onelie to come vnder subiection of Loth, but also denied that his sonnes begot of his

them, as those that were no Britains borne, but strangers vnto them, being both borne and

home with reproch, the Britains contrarie to the lawes of all nations, proclamed Arthur, being
a bastard borne, king of their realme, and foorthwith assembling their powers vnder his leading, marched on against the Saxons, in purpose to abate some part of their strength, before
the Picts (which was doubted would shortlie come to passe) should ioine with them.</p>

the great reioising of the Britains, for these so luckie beginings in the first exploits of their
late elected king. Afterwards was London easilie woon by the Britains, wherin Arthur remaining for a season, tooke aduise with his nobles how to proc&eacute;ed in his warres against the
rest of the Saxons. Finallie hauing prepared a mightie armie, he determineth to go against
those which inhabited beyond Humber northwards, with whome (as he had certeine knowledge) the Picts were ioined: for Loth comming to agr&eacute;ement with Colgerme, concluded a
leage with him, whereby they were bound to aid one another against the Britains, as common
enimies and aduersaries to them both.</p>
<p>The Britains at their comming into Yorkeshire pitched their campe not farre off from their

with the Saxons. Thus they met togither on both parts verie fiercelie, and a sore battell was
fought there betwixt them, so that for a good space it was doubtfull whether part should
haue the aduantage of the day, but at length the Picts were put to flight, which aduanced

Picts were discomfited, dreading to abide the whole brunt by themselues, betooke them also
to their h&eacute;eles, and made their race towards Yorke, as fast as their feet might beare them.</p>
<p>Arthur pursuing them thither, besieged the citie almost three moneths togither, but the
<note place="marg">York besieged.</note>
Saxons defended the walles so stoutlie, making often issues foorth vpon the Britains, that till
hunger began to constreine them, they cared little for the siege. In the end, when they
were determined to haue y&eacute;elded vp the citie, they had knowledge, how there was an huge
armie of Picts and Saxons newlie assembled, and readie to come forward to their succors;
also that king Occa (escaping from the battell wherein he had receiued the ouerthrow at 
<note place="marg">Occa returneth out of Germanie with a new power.</note>
Arthurs hands, and fl&eacute;eing afterward into Germanie) was now returned with a new power, and
arriued within the mouth of Humber. Which newes caused them to deferre all communication, in hope that if they might abide the siege but for a small time, the Britains should
shortlie be compassed in on each side, and oppressed on the sudden.</p>
<p>Arthur heard of the comming of their succours in like maner, and iudging it no wisedome
to tarie the comming of his so puissant enimies, considering what a number of diseased and sicke
persons he had alreadie in his host, by reason of their lieng abroad in the field, raised his
<note place="marg">Arthur raiseth his siege.</note>
siege, and withdrew himselfe so sp&eacute;edilie as was possible with his whole armie into Wales,
where he appointed the Armorike Britains to soiorne for that winter, with other of the meaner
sort of his owne souldiers: whilest he tooke the residue of his chosen bands, and went to
<note place="marg">Arthur returneth to London.</note>
London, there to prouide that no rebellion should be raised among the Saxons of Kent, or
other of the countries neere about. In the beginning of the next spring, he gathered his host
togither againe, and with the same went foorth against Colgerme and Occa, who being issued foorth of Northumberland, were entered into the British confines, spoiling and wasting
the countrie with their accustomed crueltie.</p>
<p>Wherevpon incountering them twise in battell, he obteined the victorie, and then besieging
<note place="marg">Arthur discomfiteth the Saxons twise in battel &amp; then againe laieth siege to Yorke and winneth it.</note>

<note place="marg">Arthur vseth the victorie with gentlenesse.</note>
Yorke, at length he entered into that citie, by meanes of a Britaine, who dwelling amongst
the Saxons there, in the night season conueied a sort of Britains into the citie, the which
breaking open the gates in the dead of the night, did let in all the whole host. Where Arthur would not suffer his men to make any great murther of the enimies, which were content to
y&eacute;eld themselues, but vsed them very gently, therby to win more praise amongst all those that
heard of his woorthie victories. The Britains hauing thus conquered the citie of Yorke, manie
feats of armes were dailie practised betwixt them and the Saxons, which held possession still
of the countrie thereabouts. But the Britains lieng in that citie all the summer and winter
<note place="marg">The Britains soiourning for the winter time within Yorke, giue th&emacr;selues vnto banketting &amp; voluptuousnesse.</note>
following, at length began to take their ease, namelie in the depth of winter, and therewith
gaue themselues to banketting, drinking, plaie, and other kinds of voluptuous pleasures, so
that it seemed they trusted more to their passed victories, than to their present force, not
fearing such dangers as was like to follow.</p>
<p>It is thought of some, that about the same time, Arthur first instituted, that the feast of
Christmasse should be kept with such excesse of meats and drinks, in all kinds of inordinate
banketting and reuell for the space of thirteene daies togither, according to the custome vsed
still through both the realmes of England and Scotland euen vnto this day, resembling the
<note place="marg">Christmasse bankets resembling the feasts Bacchanalia.</note>
feasts which the gentiles vsed to k&eacute;epe in the honor of their drunken god Bacchus, called in

vre. But whence soeuer, or by whome soeuer this insatiable gourmandise came vp amongst
vs, suerlie a great abuse it is, to see the people at such a solemne feast, where they ought to
be occupied in thanks giuing to almightie God, for the sending downe of his onelie begotten

celebrate the same feasts of Bacchanalia, and those other which the gentiles also kept, called
Floralia, and Priapalia, than the remembrance of Christs natiuitie, who abhorreth all maner
of such excesse.</p>
<p>But now to my purpose. When the next summer was once come, Arthur led foorth his

<note place="marg">A league concluded betwixt Arthur king of Britains, &amp; Loth king of Picts.</note>

<note place="marg">Mordred marieth the daughter of one Gawolan a Britaine.</note>

<note place="marg">Gawan or Gawen in seruice with K. Arthur.</note>
Britains against their enimies, but by reason of such ease and pleasure as they had taken
whilest they soiourned in Yorke, being now come into the field, they were able to abide no
paines, so that no good was doone of certeine y&eacute;ers after, till finallie Arthur ioined in league
with Loth king of the Picts. The conditions of which league were these. That Arthur
during his naturall life should reigne as king of the Britains, and after his decease, the kingdome to remaine vnto Mordred and his issue, if he chanced to haue anie. That the Picts
should aid the Britains against the Saxons, and haue all such land as might be recouered of
them beyond Humber. Also the league which was betwixt them and the Scots, they should
dulie obserue. Mordred should marrie the daughter of Gawolan a noble man amongst the
Britains and of highest authoritie next vnto Arthur himselfe: the children of this marriage to be brought vp with their grandfather in Britaine, till they came to yeeres of discretion. Gawan the brother of the foresaid Mordred, should serue king Arthur, and receiue at
his hands large interteinment, and great possessions to mainteine therewith his estate.</p>
<p>Other articles there were comprised in this league, according as was thought requisite for
the maintenance of stable friendship betwixt these kings and their nations. So that Arthur
hauing concluded this league, and still being desirous to purge the whole Ile of all miscreants
and enimies of the christian faith, he sent vnto the Scotish and Pictish kings, requiring them
<note place="marg">Arthur sendetin ambassadors vnto the kings of Scots and Picts.</note>
on the behalfe of that dutie which they owght vnto the aduancement of Christs religion, to
assemble their powers, &amp; to m&eacute;et him at Tinmouth, whither he would repaire to ioine with
them, at such day as they would appoint, from thence to march foorth against the Saxons.</p>
<p>Loth king of the Picts, and Conranus king of the Scotishmen, failed not in this so 
<note place="marg">Scots, Picts and Britains ioine togither against the Saxons.</note>
necessarie an enterprise, but agr&eacute;eable to Arthurs request, within few daies after they came forward, and ioining with the Britains, forth they went against the Saxons, whom they vnderstood to be alreadie in campe, vnder the conduct of their king Occa, in purpose to stop their
passage. When both the armies were approched n&eacute;ere togither, they prepared to the battell,
and first Colgerme duke of Northumberland mounting vpon a light gelding, rode almost euen
hard to the face of the Picts, where they stood in their order of battell right stoutlie, and there
vttering manie reprochfull words vnto Loth, and other of his nobles, for breach of their 
<note place="marg">Colgerme reproueth Loth.</note>
promised friendship to him and his Saxons, declared that he trusted shortlie to see iust punishment light vpon them for this falshood and vntruths sake, in thus ioining with their former
enimies against their most trustie friends and stedfast alies.</p>
<p>The Pictish king not greatlie mooued h&eacute;erewith, commanded his standards to aduance
forward, and the Saxons likewise hasted apace towards them, so that the one being come within danger of shot of the other, the Picts let flie their arrowes verie freshlie. Arthur in the
meane time hauing set his people in araie, exhorted them to fight manfullie: and so soone as
he perceiued that the fraie was begun by the Picts, he in semblable wise c&omacr;mandeth the Britains to giue the onset, so that immediatlie there insued a sore conflict, the Scots being in the
right wing, &amp; sleaing Cheldrike one of the chiefest capteins amongst the Saxons, quicklie discomfited that wing with the which they were first matched. Colgerme with his Saxons incountring (as is said) with the Picts, placed in the left wing, rushed in amongst his enimies vpon
an earnest desire to be reuenged of his aduersarie king Loth) with such violence, that at their
first incounter he ouerthrew the same Loth: but immediatlie therevpon two Pictish 
<note place="marg">Colgerme is run through by his aduersaries.</note>
horssemen running at Colgerme sidelingwise, bare him quite through.</p>
<p>In the meane time, Loth by meane of his strong habergion escaping without hurt, was relieued by such as stood about him, and restored againe to his companie: but Colgerme being
dead before he could be recouered from amongst the throng of his enimies, his men were
so discomforted therewith, that streightwaies therevpon they fell to running away. The maine
<note place="marg">The Saxons are put to flight.</note>

perceiuing, the more earnestlie preassed foorth vpon them, so that in the end Occa being 
<note place="marg">Occa constreined to fl&eacute;e.</note>
constreined to fl&eacute;e, and receiuing a sore wound, had much adoo to be conueied awaie by some
of his horssemen, the Britains pursued so fiercelie vpon him. At length being brought vnto
the sea side, he got vessels, and escaped ouer into Germanie. This victorie being thus 
<note place="marg">Vpon what condition Arthur receiueth the Saxons vpon their submission.</note>
atchiued, constreined the Saxons to y&eacute;eld vnto king Arthur, simplie submitting themselues
vnto his mercie, who of his clemencie was contented to pardon them of life and goods, vpon
condition they would become christians, and from thencefoorth neuer after to make anie
warres vpon their neighbors the Britains, Scots, or Picts. But if they would not agr&eacute;e h&eacute;erevnto, then leauing their goods, armor, and weapon behind them, they should auoid the land,
&amp; that within 18 daies next insuing.</p>
<p>Manie of the Saxons that could get passage, sailed ouer into Germanie. Other feining
themselues to become christians, remained in the land, looking one day for better hap &amp; fortune. Diuerse that were not able by meanes of pouertie to get awaie within the time appointed, and yet refusing to be christened, were put to death, according to the prcclamation set
foorth for the same purpose, so that in comparison verie few amongst them receiued the christian faith sincerelie, and with a true meaning mind. Things being thus quieted in Northumberland, Arthur tooke order for the reparing of churches abroad in the countrie, which the
<note place="marg">Arthur caused churches to be repared.</note>
Saxons had ouerthrowne or defaced; &amp; namelie in the citie of Yorke he bestowed great cost,
where the cruell infidels had doone much hurt vpon churches, and other religious houses.</p>
<p>In the y&eacute;ere following, Arthur had newes how the Saxons which held the Ile of Wight,
ioining with the Kentish Saxons, had doone great displeasures vnto the Britains, on that side
of the Thames, killing &amp; sleaing an huge number of them with great crueltie, wherewith
being sore mooued, he drew towards London with his armie, purposing vtterlie to destroie all
<note place="marg">Arthur purposeth to destroie the whole race of the Saxons in Albion.</note>
the east &amp; south Saxons, since otherwise he could not prouide for the suertie of his subiects,
being still in danger to be murthered and robbed, so long as anie of that wicked generation of
the Saxons remained heere amongst them.</p>
<p>By meanes also of the league, he had with him in this iournie ten thousand Picts, &amp; as manie Scots: Eugenius nephue to king Conran by his brother Congall being generall ouer the
Scots, and Mordred the sonne of king Loth by his wife Anne, gouerning the Picts, a lustie

yoong gentleman, verie wittie and towardlie in all his dooings. Furthermore, Arthur vnderstanding what hurt rest and ease had doone amongst his men of warre, caused them to keepe
the field in all this iournie, and passing by London, lodged them a little beside the riuer
of Thames. But he himselfe with some of his nobles, entred into the citie, causing supplications to be made vnto almightie God thr&eacute;e daies together, for good successe to follow
against the Saxons. On the fourth day hearing diuine seruice celebrated by the bishop of
London, and causing a sermon to be made in the market place, he committed himselfe and
his whole armie vnto the tuition of Christ, and his mother the virgine, whose image in st&eacute;ed
<note place="marg">Arthurs badge.</note>
of a badge he bare in his shield continuallie from that day forward, as diuerse h&eacute;eretofore
haue written. After this, issuing foorth of the citie, he willed all his men to be of good 
<note place="marg">Arthurs exhortation to his people.</note>
comfort, as they that fought in a iust quarell against Pagans, and enimies of the faith. Mordred
and his father in law Gawolane passed on before the battels with fiue thousand horssemen,
and being come within fiue miles of the Saxons, who likewise were assembled in campe, there
came from them vnto Arthur ambassadors, requiring him to staie his iournie, for they were
<note place="marg">An offer made by the Saxons vnto king Arthur.</note>
readie (if they might haue libertie so to doo) to depart out of the land with their goods and
substance, without further molesting the Britains, either by one meanes or other.</p>
<p>Arthur would neither consent heerevnto, nor yet grant a truce for thr&eacute;e daies, for the which
they made earnest sute, but bad them depart for that time, onelie assuring them that he
would not come passing two miles forwards for that day, so that if they thought good, they
might returne to him in the morning, and haue answer what the chiefest gouernors of his
host thought touching their request, by whome he would haue the matter more throughlie
debated. In the meane time, whilest the Britains were busied with hearing of these ambassadors, and taking aduise what was best to doo touching their demand, the Saxons marched

in the end oppressed with multitude, they were forced to fl&eacute;e, and so did, not resting till they
came in sight of the whole armie. In which flight, Mordred and Gawolan by helpe of their
souldiers, being mounted vpon their horsses, escaped without hurt, though they lost no small
number of their companie, as well in the fight as in the chase.</p>
<p>The Saxons ambassadors being not yet departed out of the British campe, were h&eacute;erevpon
staied till the next morning, and then had answer giuen them, that from thencefoorth the 
<note place="marg">What answer the Saxons ambassadors had at Arthurs hands.</note>
Britains were not minded to heare anie messengers of the Saxons comming to intreat of peace,
since it was manifest enough, they ment nothing but falshood, as well app&eacute;ered in that they
had against the law of armes, whilest their ambassadors were in communication, distressed part
of the British armie, and therefore they should assure themselues, to haue at Arthurs hands
nothing but cruell war to the vttermost of his power, in reuenge of such their great vntruths
and cloked dealings. They had scarse receiued their answer, but that there came from the
Saxons fortie other ambassadors, being men of great authoritie amongst them, to excuse that

to be kept in the marshals tent, that in no wise they should escape, whilest he himselfe in the

H&eacute;ereof also insued such a tumult and noise amongst the Saxons, running vp and downe,
calling and crieng one to another, as it happeneth in such cases of extreme feare, that the best
aduised amongest them wist not well what to doo. Wherevpon Mordred desirous to reuenge his last ouerthrowe, brake in also vpon his enimies verie fiercelie.</p>
<p>But some of them hauing gotten them into their armor, stood at their defense awhile
amongst their carts and carriages, and so resisted the Britains on that side for a season; other
of the Saxons hauing no leasure to arme themselues, nor to draw into anie order of battell, by
reason of the sudden impression of the Britains, brake foorth of the campe on the contrarie
side, &amp; fled so fast as their f&eacute;et might beare them. But being pursued by the British

drowned, choosing rather that kind of death, than so cruellie to be murthered by the aduersaries hands: verelie the Britains shewed no mercie that day, for so manie as came within

in the land, y&eacute;elding a y&eacute;erelie tribute vnto the Britains, and also with condition that they
should become christians. The Scotishmen and Picts which had aided the Britains in this
iournie, soiorned a while after at London, where Arthur feasted &amp; banketted them in most

trouble or disorder. But finallie, when king Conrane began to wax aged, and that such as had
the chiefe dooings vnder him, sought not the execution of iustice, but their owne commodities, to the hinderance of a multitude, the people began to repine thereat, and to practise a
conspiracie with diuerse of the nobles against Conrane, and those which ruled by his 
<note place="marg">A conspiracie practised against Conrane.</note>
appointment.</p>
<p>It chanced that there was one Toncet, a man of base birth, assigned by the kings commission to be chiefe iustice, or as it were chancelor for the administration of the lawes in Murrey land, a person passing full of rigorous crueltie, especiallie in iudgements of life and death,
<note place="marg">An euill officer.</note>
and in gathering vp of all manner of forfeitures of penall lawes, which he did onelie to purchase
fauor of the king, by the inriching of his coffers, in respect whereof he had small regard either
of right or wrong, so that there were hope of somewhat to be gotten. Amongest other the
violent dooings of this Toncet, he caused diuerse merchantmen of the towne of Fores in Murrey land (as then the chiefest towne of all that countrie) to be accused of treason by a light
information, and in the end executed without anie apparant matter, onelie vpon a couetous
desire to haue their goods and riches, bicause they were men of great wealth and substance.
Diuerse noble men of the countrie there abouts, and namelie of the towne of Fores, being
partlie of kin vnto those merchants, were sore offended with this act, and h&eacute;erevpon they first
came vnto Toncet, and reuiled him with manie high reprochtull woords, and afterwards fell
<note place="marg">A presumptuous act.</note>
vpon him in the place of open iudgement where he sat as then in his iudgement seate, &amp; there
murthered him, getting them foorthwith vp into the mounteins, to auoid the danger which
they knew vnpossible for them to escape, if they should happen to be taken while Conrane
should be liuing.</p>
<p>After this, they deuised how they might increase their heinous deed and bold enterprise with
<note place="marg">The determination of the murtherers to dispatch the king also.</note>
an other farre more horrible and notable, which was to slea the king himselfe, as the originall cause of all such mischiefe that then reigned in the realme through the vnwoorthie gouernment of his vniust ministers and couetous magistrats, hoping withall to obteine the fauor
of some of the noble men, whome they knew to maligne the king and his councell most extremelie, and thereby in short time to be assured of their pardon. Shortlie after it chanced
that one Donald also gouernor of Atholl, a man in great fauor and trust with the king, had
<note place="marg">Donald gouernor of Athol conspireth with the outlawes to murther the king.</note>
vnderstanding what these outlawes intended, and therevpon practised with them by priuie
messengers, that they should come in secret manner vnto Enuerlocht&eacute;e, where the king soiorned, promising them by most assured meanes of oths and vowes, that they should haue all
the furtherance he could deuise towards the atchiuing of their enterprise.</p>

though he had knowne nothing of the matter, got himselfe quickelie out of the waie when he
saw them once entered within the doore of the chamber. Conrane the king perceiuing how
he was betraied, and that his enimies were got into his chamber readie to murther him, stept
foorth of his bed; and falling downe vpon his kn&eacute;es besought them to take pitie of his age,
and not to defile their hands in the bloud of their naturall lord and king, considering the fault
was not his, if they had b&eacute;ene anie waies wronged Howbeit they doubting nothing but least

being placed there vpon the chaire of marble) that he should s&eacute;e in anie wise the authors

<note place="marg">Eugenius is suspected of his predecessors death.</note>
of his vncles death dulie punished, to the example of others, that they should not attempt
the like h&eacute;ereafter against their liege lord and crowned king: but he contrariwise did not
onelie forgiue the offense, but also receiued the forenamed Donald with other the murtherers
into his seruice, and made them of his priuie councell, which caused manie men to suspect,
least he himselfe had b&eacute;ene of councell with them in committing that murther. The talke
whereof was so common in all mens mouths, namelie amongst the common people, that the
queene Dowager late wife to king Conrane, doubting not onelie the suertie of hir owne

life, but also of hir two sons (which she had by the said Conrane, the one named Reginan,
and the other Aidan) fled with them ouer into Ireland, where within few yeeres after, she
died with the one of hir sonnes, that is to say, Reginan: the other Aidan was honorablie
brought vp by the king of that countrie, according to his birth and degr&eacute;e.</p>
<p>Eugenius in the beginning of his reigne, to win thereby the peoples fauor, demeaned himselfe most gentlie in all his proc&eacute;edings, dooing nothing that tasted in anie part of crueltie.
He would oftentimes sit amongst the iudges himselfe, and if he suspected least anie man

<note place="marg">Commendable ordinances.</note>
had wrong, he would licence them to plead their case anew. And such as he perceiued
were not of abilitie to follow their sute in anie cause of right, he would helpe them with
monie of the common treasurie. He ordeined also, that no orphane should be compelled
to answer anie action, or otherwise be vexed by sute of law. Moreouer, that no widow
should be constreined to come past a mile foorth of hir owne doores for anie matter in controuersie betwixt hir and anie other person, to be heard afore anie iudges or publike officers.
Robbers, th&eacute;eues, and their receiuers he caused to be dulie punished, to refraine other from
attempting the like offenses. And also he had a speciall regard for the obseruing of the
league betwixt his subiects and the Picts, with the Britains, according to the tenor of the
same.</p>
<p>About this season should it be also that Arthur did atchiue all those woorthie victories,
<note place="marg">The victorious conquests ascribed to Arthur.</note>
which are ascribed vnto him against the Scots, Irishmen, Danes, Norwegians, and other
northerne people. Moreouer it is written by some authors, that he should subdue the most
part of Germanie with the low countries, Britaine, Normandie, France, and the Romans,
with the people of the east: but the credit h&eacute;ereof resteth with the same authors. Onelie
it is certeine (as Hector Boetius affirmeth) that Arthur liued in the daies of Iustinianus the

sundrie parts of the Romane empire, pitifullie wasting and spoiling the same, where yet such
writers as haue set foorth those warres, make no mention of Arthur at all. &para; Therefore
letting all doubtfull things passe, I will proc&eacute;e with mine author, and declare what he hath
found written in such Scotish chronicles as he followeth touching the British Arthur, which
for that it partlie varieth from the other our common chronicles, namelie Geffrey of

<p>To the purpose then. After that the Britains were deliuered from the terror of the

<note place="marg">The request of the Britains to haue one of their owne nation appointed to succ&eacute;ed king Arthur.</note>
Saxons, and that with quietnesse they began to wax wealthie, they repented them of the
league, which they had concluded afore with Loth king of the Picts, speciallie for that they
could not in anie wise be contented to haue anie stranger to reigne amongst them, and
h&eacute;erevpon comming vnto Arthur, required of him, sith he himselfe had no issue to succ&eacute;ed
him, that it might please him yet, to name one of his owne nation to gouerne them after his
deceasse. Arthur not gainsaieng their request, willed them (sith their pleasure was such, in
no wise to haue a stranger to reigne ouer them) to name one themselues, being descended
of the bloud roiall, and such a one as in whome they had perceiued some towardlie proofe
of wisedome and valiancie: and he for his part promised to ratifie their election. The nobles
with great reioising of the people drawing together to consult for the choise of such a one,
as might be acceptable to all the British nation, at length agr&eacute;ed vpon Constantinus, the

sonne of Cadore duke of Cornwall, a goodlie yoong gentleman, both for his person and
other his woorthie qualities much to be commended. Who being brought by the p&eacute;eres of
the realme into the councell chamber, and there presented vnto king Arthur, as one most
m&eacute;etest to succeed him; Arthur accepted their election verie gladlie, and caused the same
Constantine foorthwith to be proclamed heire apparant to the crowne, by the name of prince
<note place="marg">Constantine proclamed heire apparant &amp; prince of Britaine.</note>
of Britaine, which notified him to be successor to the king in gouernement of the realme.
Constantine being in such wise preferred, behaued himselfe so honorablie, and with such a
shew of gentle demeanor, that he wan him much praise, with an opinion of high woorthinesse am&ograve;ngst all the British nation.</p>
<p>In this meane time was Loth the king of the Picts deceassed, leauing his name as a 
<note place="marg">Lothian taketh the name of Loth the Pictish king.</note>

<note place="marg">Mordred succeedeth Loth in the kingdome of Pictland.</note>

<note place="marg">Mordred complaineth vnto king Arthur, for that Censtantine was created his heire apparant.</note>
perpetuall memorie vnto his countrie of Pictland, the which euer since as a remembrance of his
woorthinesse, hath b&eacute;ene called Lothian, or Louthian; but his sonne Mordred, succ&eacute;eding
him in gouernement of the Pictish kingdome, and hearing that Constantine was proclamed
heire apparant of Britaine, was sore moued therewith, and immediatlie sending his ambassadours vnto king Arthur, complained, for that contrarie to the honor of his kinglie
estate, he had broken the league concluded betwixt him and his father late of famous memorie king Loth, wherein it was agr&eacute;ed amongest other things, that there should none succ&eacute;ed in the kingdome of Britaine, after Arthurs deceasse, but the children begot betwixt K.
I oth and his wife qu&eacute;ene Anne, or such as descended of them; where contrariwise it was
notified vnto the Pictish people, that Constantine the sonne of Cadore was elected prince,
and thereby inabled as heire apparant to the crowne.</p>
<p>They required him therefore to call himselfe to remembrance, and not so lightlie to agr&eacute;e
vnto the flattering persuasions of the Britains, aduising him vnto that thing which was
m&eacute;erelie repugnant to reason, and against both gods lawes and mans, admonishing him
withall to obserue the league, according to the oth, which he had solemnelie taken vpon
him, and to mooue his subiects to doo the like, least for the contrarie, they should
prouoke the wrath of almightie God against them, who is the iust reuenger of all such
as go about to breake leagues and couenanted pactions. Herevnto answere was made
<note place="marg">The answere made to the Pictish ambassadours.</note>
by consent of the nobles of Britaine, that the league which was concluded betwixt Arthur
and Loth, indured but for the life times of them two onelie, and to ceasse by either of their
deaths: therefore Arthur had doone nothing contrarie to anie pact or promise made, but
according to the duetie of a prince that tendered the weale of his subiects, had prouided
them one to succeed him of their owne nation, for doubt least the realme after his deceasse
should fall into the hands of strangers, which in no wise ought of right to be suffered.
Therefore if the Picts loued the suertie of their owne estate, it should be good for them to hold
themselues contented with their owne bounds, least if they sought for other mens liuings,
they might happilie within short time perceiue, what dooth insue oftentimes vpon such rash
and vnaduised attempts.</p>
<p>The Pictish ambassadors returning home with this answer, caused the whole nation to
<note place="marg">The Picts purpose to be reuenged on the Britains by open war.</note>

<note place="marg">The Picts solicit both Scots and Saxons to make warre vpon the Britains.</note>

<note place="marg">Eugenius the Scotish king agr&eacute;eable to the request of the Picts.</note>
take such disdaine therewith, that immediatlie they resolued to reuenge their wrongs by
open warres; but first they thought good to trie if they might procure the Scotishmen to
take part with them, in reuenge of such iniuries as they had in like maner latelie receiued at
the Britains hands Moreouer, repenting themselues, that they had in times past aided the
Britains against the Saxons, they purpose to trie if they might now mooue the same Saxons
eftsoones to make warres vpon the Britains, thereby to be the better able to mainteine their
owne quarrell against them. First, such ambassadours as were sent from Mordred vnto
Eugenius king of the Scots, found him verie agreeable vnto their requests, and the sooner,
for that such Scotish rebels as fled vnto Arthur, were not onelie receiued by him, but also
mainteined to make rodes and incursions into the Scotish borders.</p>
<p>Arthur hauing knowledge of the deuises of his enimies (the warres being first proclamed)
he furnished all the sea-coasts with notable numbers of men, to withstand the landing of the
Saxons, if they should fortune to attempt anie inuasion. That doone, he passed foorth with

and were come as farre as the riuer of Humber, n&eacute;ere to the bankes whereof they had
pitched their tents, as in a place fatall for the Britains to be vanquished in. Both the
armies being brought here into order of battell, the one in sight of the other, there were
certeine bishops of those thr&eacute;e nations that tooke great pains to ride to and fro betwixt them,
to exhort the kings vnto peace and concord, considering what mischiefe and great bioudshed
should insue, if vpon wilfullnesse they would s&eacute;eke to trie that by dint of sword, which
they might make an end of by means of amiable treatie and friendlie agr&eacute;ement. Againe,
they could not doo the thing that might more content the Saxons, common enimies to
christian religion, than if by their incountring togither in battell, they should so inf&eacute;eble
their whole powers, whereby the Saxons might haue readie means and occasion offered to
execute their gr&eacute;edie desires to conquere the whole Ile. Mordred and Eugenius were 
<note place="marg">Mordred and Eugenius were persuaded vnto peace.</note>
persuaded by this earnest trauell of the bishops, to put their matter in compromise, and to lay
away their armour and weapon, if they might haue assurance that the league made with
king Loth should in euerie point be obserued. Arthur likewise at the sute of the same
bishops, would haue b&eacute;ene contented for his part to haue agr&eacute;ed herevnto; but other of
the Britains, namelie those that were of kin and aliance vnto Constantine their prince, could
<note place="marg">The Britains would not consent to haue anie peace talked vpon.</note>
in no wise be persuaded therevnto; but rather with manie reprochfull words rebuked the
bishops for their vntimelie sute, s&eacute;eing the enimies readie ranged in battell at point to giue
the onset, so that (as they alledged) it might be doubted what they meant by their motion,
vnlesse they went about to betraie the armie, vnder pretense of a cloked treatie for an vnprofitable agr&eacute;ement. These or such like words were vnneth ended, when suddenlie the
<note place="marg">The battell is begun.</note>
noise being raised on both sides, the battels rushed togither right fiercelie. The Britains had
the disaduantage of the place, being so incumbred with mires, bogs, and mosses, that they
could not well aid themselues, nor handle their weapons to anie purpose. Yet did the battell
<note place="marg">A cruell battell.</note>
continue a long time, to the destruction of such numbers of men; that the riuer Humber
(n&eacute;ere vnto the which this field was fought) was so mingled with bloud, that the water
thereof being all coloured red, caried no small number of dead bodies downe into the sea.
In the middest of the fight, there was one with lowd voice in the British toong cried out to
<note place="marg">A craftie policie.</note>

<note place="marg">This was one of the Picts.</note>
the Britains (of purpose prompted therevnto) that Arthur with other of the nobles on his
side were slaine, and therefore it were but follie to trust anie longer vpon victorie, but rather
were it wisdome for euerie man by flight to prouide for his owne safetie.</p>
<p>This voice woonderfullie incouraged the Scotishmen and Picts, but the Britains were put
<note place="marg">The Britains put to flight.</note>
in such feare therewith, that the most part of them immediatlie herevpon fell to running
away. Others of them iudging this to be but some craftie and subtill practise of the enimies
deuised of purpose, as it was in d&eacute;ed, to discomfort them with, abode by it still: manfullie
continuing in fight, till they were beaten downe and slaine in maner euerie mothers sonne.
This victorie being thus hardlie got, cost more mens liues than anie other had doone of
manie yeares before; for of the Scots and Picts being vanquishers, there died in that mortall
battell aboue 20000 men, togither with Mordred, and a great number of the nobilitie of
<note place="marg">Twentie thousand Scots and Picts slaine.</note>

<note place="marg">Arthur with 30000 Britains slaine.</note>

<note place="marg">Gawan is slaine.</note>

<note place="marg">Gaime and Gawolan are slaine.</note>
both the nations. Of the Britains and such other as were with them in aid, there were
slaine, what in battell and what in chase, at the point of 30000, among whome was Arthur
himselfe, with Gawan or Galuan (as some bookes haue) brother vnto Mordred, who bare
such good will and intire loue vnto his lord and maister the said Arthur, that he fought
that day most earnestlie on his side against his owne naturall brother the said Mordred.
Also there were killed Caime and Gawolan, with the most part of all the residue of the
British nobilitie, and manie prisoners taken, by reason that Humber kept them in from flieng
anie way foorth on the one side, which prisoners also were afterwards slaine, the gentlemen
onelie excepted.</p>

betwixt them, the Scots had for their parts certeine faire charets laden with rich stuffe and
iewels, also horsses and armours, beside sundrie noble men, whom they had to their prisoners.
Vnto the Picts fell for their portion qu&eacute;ene Guainore, with the ladies and gentlewomen, and
diuers other of the noble men, besides a great quantite of other rich preie and booties.
These prisoners, which the Picts had, were conueied into a castell in Angus, called Dunbarre,
<note place="marg">Dunbarre in Angus, not that in Louthian.</note>
a place of great strength in those daies, though at this present there remaineth nothing but
the name with the ruines therof. In which castell they were deteined vnder sure ward,
during the residue of their naturall liues. In witnesse wherof there be remaining vnto this
day, the graues and monuments where manie of these captiue Britains were buried, in the
fields of a towne in that countrie called Megill, not past 10 miles from Dund&eacute;e: but amonget
the residue, that of Guainore is most famous.</p>
<p>There goeth a plaine tale ouer all that countrie, told for an assured trueth, that if anie
<note place="marg">The fable of qu&eacute;ene Guainores graue buried in Angus.</note>
woman chance to tread vpon that graue, they shall remaine barren without bringing foorth
anie issue more than the said Guainore did. But whether this be true or not, certeine it is
(as Boetius writeth) that there dare no woman come n&eacute;ere that graue, not onelie eschuing
it themselues, but also commanding their daughters to beware thereof. This bloudie battell
weakened so much the forces both of the Scots, Picts, and Britains, that manie a day after
they were not able to recouer againe their former states and dignities. The yeare also that
these thr&eacute;e nations incountred thus cruellie togither, was after the birth of our Sauiour 542,

should remaine none amongst them aliue to make anie claime to the same kingdome, other

lurmirike though he were not christened himselfe, yet permitted the christian faith to be
preached amongst his people, and concluding a league with the Scotishmen and Picts, kept
the same inuiolate during his life time most sincerlie. The Scotish king Eugenius also

<p><hi rend="smallcap">AFTER</hi> his funerall obsequies finished in Colmekill, where he lieth buried amongest his

ancestors, his brother Conuall was chosen to succ&eacute;ed him in administration of the kingdome,
a prince of such inclination to vertue and godlines, as all men may iustlie woonder thereat.
He bare such zealous deuotion towards the worshipping of the crosse (a thing to put men
<note place="marg">Conuals deuotion to the crosse.</note>
in remembrance of Christs passion as he tooke it) that which way soeuer he rode (as it is
reported) h&eacute;e had the same borne before him, and at his getting vp and lighting downe from
his horsse, he with all the multitude of people standing about him, would worship it, kn&eacute;eling downe, &amp; reuerentlie kissing it. This crosse was of siluer with a crucifix thereon, and
letters grauen in a plate fastened to the staffe, conteining these two words: <emph>Christianorum
gloria.</emph> He commanded also that the signe of the crosse should be set vpon the tops of
<note place="marg">Crosses set vpon the tops of st&eacute;&eacute;ples.</note>
st&eacute;eples, and on the highest towers of the gates of castels &amp; townes. Moreouer he forbad
the crosse to be grauen or painted vpon anie pauement, least anie man should vnreuerentlie
tread vpon it. Furthermore he had priests and other religious men in such honor, as 
<note place="marg">Conuals deuotion towards church men.</note>
nothing could be more, appointing them to haue the tenths of all those fruits which the earth
y&eacute;elded. Sundrie ordinances he made also, for the gr&eacute;euous punishment of all such as in
anie wise misused a priest, or other religious person: as he that gaue any of them a blow,
should loose his hand for it: and h&eacute;e that slue one of them, should forfeit his goods, and
b&eacute;e burned quicke. Againe, he bestowed manie rich iewels, and gaue diuers great gifts

vnto churches, prouiding the ministers of sufficient liuings, and appointed that they should
haue their houses n&eacute;ere vnto their churches, to be readie to execute that which apperteined
vnto their offices, when anie n&eacute;ed required.</p>
<p>The king being thus vertuouslie disposed, caused the whole number of his subiects by his

king Conuall had builded and founded for that purpose, appointing amongst them rulers &amp;
ministers, such as he thought most conuenient. But saint Colmo himselfe, and the other

<p>Amongst the Picts at the same time the heresie of Pelagius had infected the minds of many,
<note place="marg">The heresie of Pelagius in Pictland.</note>
by meane that diuerse of that nation hauing dwelled a long time in Britaine, returning into
their countrie, brought that pestilent doctrine home with them, and taught it vnto other.
Saint Colme therefore informed hereof, passed into Louthian vnto Brudeus as then king
of the Picts, earnestlie trauelling to instruct both him and his people in the right beliefe, and
to extirpe out of their hearts all ercnious opinions of that damnable sect of the Pelagians
lore. At the same time, that blessed man Kenrigerne, otherwise called Mungo, gouerned the

church of Glascow, as bishop of the same, who resorting into the companie of this saint
Colme, had much conference with him, to both their comforts, concerning the true articles
of our faith.</p>
<p>This Kentigerne was descended of the bloud roiall of the Pictish kings, as son vnto that
<note place="marg">Thamew or Thametes rauished by Eugenius king of Scotland, of which rauishment she bare the foresaid Kentigerne.</note>
vertuous woman Thametes or Thamew, daughter vnto Loth king of the Picts, whome a
yoong lustie gentleman, or (as some haue written) the last mentioned Eugenius the Scotish
king rauished by force, and begot of hir the said Kentigerne. He was greatlie in fauour
with the foresaid Brudeus the Pictish king, as one that was n&eacute;ere of his bloud. For the
same Brudeus was nephue vnto the foresaid Loth by his brother called Melethon, and therefore succ&eacute;eded in the kingdome of the Picts, after that Mordred was slaine, as before is expressed. Kentigerne went with saint Colme vnto the castell of Calidon, otherwise called

Dounkeld, where they remained six moneths in a monasterie there, builded by king Conuall,
teaching and preaching vnto the people of Athole, Calidon, and Angus, that in great numbers came vnto them, to heare their godlie instructions. There is in the same place, where
the said castell sometimes stood, a church dedicated vnto saint Colme, built of faire square
stone, being at this day a bishops see, commonlie called Dounkeld, indowed with manie faire

<p>At the six moneths end, those two vertuous persons taking their leaue each of other, not

on land on the coasts of Scotland, was no sooner there arriued, but that presentlie he had
knowledge how the king was dead, being the yeere of his reigne the 10, and after the birth
of our Sauiour 579.</p>

inthronized king in Argile, by the fr&eacute;e election of all the estates, he neuerthelesse kept on
his former purposed iournie, and came vnto Kinnatill, bringing Aidan with him (appointed
by Conuall to haue receiued the gouernement of the kingdome if he had liued) they were
both receiued with all beneuolence of the said Kinnatill c&omacr;trarie to most mens expectation:

<p>By what spirit of prophesie he vttred these words, it is vncerteine, but sure it is that his

Aidan receiued the crowne, sitting vpon the marble stone, after the custome in those daies
vsed, by the hands of that holie father saint Colme. Who willing that silence might be
kept, laid his right hand vpon the kings head, and in his left hand holding his crosier staffe,
made a briefe exhortation, as well to the king as to his people, admonishing them of their
duties each towards other, but especiallie he exhorted them vnto peace and concord, and
before all things to remember to walke in the waies of the Lord, for in so dooing they might
hope for wealth and prosperitie in the state of their commonwealth, with all other good
graces, whereas otherwise, if either the people forgot their duties towards God, or that the
king regarded not dulie to execute or fulfill his office, in giuing God thanks for his bountious
liberalitie and high benefits bestowed vpon him, it should come to passe, that intestine seditions, conspiracies, and other mischiefes should rise among them, to the irrecouerable
losse of the realme, by bringing the same into danger to be ouerrun with some forrein
power, if they did not repeat in time, and call to God for his fauour, that it might please
him to reduce them againe into the right path of his lawes &amp; ordinances, whensoeuer they
should so fall from the same. When saint Colme had made an end of these or the like
his wholsome aduertisments, all the people reioising thereat, promised with one voice, and
<note place="marg">The promise of the people.</note>
therewith vowed to follow the same, and to be euer readie to obeie the commandement
of their prince, and the holie instructions of their bishops and other the ecclesiasticall
ministers. The assemblie being once dissolued, the king departed into Galloway, and there
<note place="marg">The kings iournie into Galloway.</note>
deliuered the countrie of certeine British robbers that had inuaded it. After this, studieng
to mainteine good orders and quiet rule through his dominions, he appointed an assemblie of
the chiefest p&eacute;eres of his realme, to be holden y&eacute;erelie in three seuerall parties thereof, as
<note place="marg">Aidan appointeth sessions to b&eacute;e kept y&eacute;erlie in thr&eacute;e parts of his realme.</note>

affaires, as they should s&eacute;e cause and occasion. He required also S. Colme to be present
euer with them, that matters touching religion might be the better preuided for, and that
the people might take all things doone in those publike sessions in right good part, bicause
such an holie and vertuous father of the church was amongst them, and hauing the chiefest

<p>Thus continued the realme in quiet state for certeine yeeres togither, till it chanced that

called Dounkeld, with great slaughter on both sides, though in the end the victorie yet remained with the Scots ; but losing Arthurnus the sonne of Aidan their king, they reioised not
greatlie at the gaine. That holie man saint Colme troubled with such rewes, came vnto
Aidan, and declaring vnto him how grieuouslie he had offended almightie God, in procuring
such mischiefe as had insued of this warre, and reciting in particular the branches thereof, he
mooued the king vnto such repentance for his trespasse, that he wholie submitted himselfe
vnto saint Colmes chastisement, who being about to depart in semblance sore offended, the
king got him by the sleeue, and would in no wise suffer him to go from him, till he had declared
vnto him some comfortable meanes how to redresse the matter, for the quieting of his conscience. At length saint Colme lamenting the kings case, suffered himselfe to be intreated, and
therevpon repaired vnto Brudeus the Pictish king, mouing him by way of diuerse godlie aduertisements to incline his affection vnto peace. At length he did so much by trauelling sundrie
times to and fro betwixt the two kings, that he brought them vnto agr&eacute;ement, for all matters
depending in controuersie betwixt them and their subiects.</p>
<p>Thus saint Colme hauing accomplished that which he came for, returned againe into the
westerne Iles vnto his woonted home, where he did by wholesome documents and vertuous
examples instruct the seruants of God in the way of his lawes and commandements. In this
meane time the Saxons hauing driuen and put backe the Britains into Wales, and occupieng
all the residue of their lands and countries, they diuided the same into seuen parts, ordeining
seuen seuerall kings to gouerne the same as kingdomes. Ouer that of Northumberland,
adioining next vnto the Picts, one Edelfred reigned, a man of exc&eacute;eding desire to inlarge his
dominion. He went by all means he could deuise, to persuade Brudeus the Pictish king to
renew the warres with the Scots, promising him all the aid he could make against them, not
onelie for that he knew the Scots to haue b&eacute;ene euer enimies vnto the Saxons, but also for
that he himselfe was descended of the nation called Agathyrses, of the which the Picts (as
was thought) were also come. But the cause why he wished that there might be warres
raised betwixt the Scots and Picts, was not for anie good will he bare to the Picts, but onelie
<note place="marg">Edelfreds purpose.</note>
to the end that their power being weakened through the same, he might haue a more easie
preie of their countrie, the which he purposed vpon occasion to inuade, and ioine vnto his
owne kingdome of Northumberland.</p>
<p>Brudeus at the first gaue no eare vnto his earnest motions and large offers, but at length
through the counsell and procurement of some of his nobles, corrupted by bribes receiued at
Edelfreds hands, and still putting into the kings head sundrie forged informations of the
Scotishmens dailie attempts against the Pictish nation; he determined to ioine with the Saxons
against them, and caused thervpon warre to be proclamed against the Scots, as those
that had spoiled and robbed his subiects, contrarie to the league and all bonds of old friendship
and former amitie betwixt them. The Scotish king Aidan perceiuing the practise of the
<note place="marg">A league concluded betwixt the Scots &amp; Britains, with the articles of the same.</note>
Saxons, and togither therwith the vntruth of the Picts, the better to be able to resist their malice, ioineth in league with the Britains: this ardicle being the chiefest in the whole couenant :
that if the enimies first inuaded the Britains, then an armie of Scots should be sent with all speed
into Britaine, to helpe to defend the countrie against such inuasions: but if the Scots were first
inuaded, then should the Britains in semblable maner come ouer to their aid.</p>
<p>The Saxons hauing knowledge of this appointment betwixt Scots &amp; Britains; to draw the
Scots foorth of their countrie, and so to haue them at more aduantage, procured the Picts to
<note place="marg">The Picts &amp; Saxons enter into the land of the Britains.</note>
ioine with them: and so both their powers being vnited together, entred into the British confines. Aidan according to the couenant came streight vnto the aid of the Britains. Edelfred
and Brudeus refused to fight for certeine daies, as it were of purpose, therby to wearie the
Scots with watch and trauell, being as then far from home. Also they looked dailie to haue

gaue the onset so fiercelie vpon those Saxons, that at the first, sleaing Cutha Ceulines sonne,
with a great number of other, they easilie distressed and put the residue to flight.</p>
<p>Aidan would not suffer his men to pursue too far in the chase, but called them backe by the the
sound of a trumpet, who being assembled h&eacute;erewith about their standards, made such ioy and
triumph, as greater could not be deuised, what with dansing, singing, and plaieng on pipes
and other instruments, according to the manner in those daies. But as they were thus in the
middest of their chiefest mirth, suddenlie app&eacute;ered the Saxons and Picts, which were with
Edelfred and Brudeus, approching towards them in good order of battell, with whome were
also the residue of the Westsaxons, that had escaped from the late bickering. Wherevpon
the Scots and Britains amazed with the sight h&eacute;ereof, were suddenlie striken out of countenance, insomuch that Aidan went amongst them, and with a bold countenance exhorted
them to remember how valiantlie they had alreadie put to flight the other of their enimies, so
that there was great hope for assured victorie of these likewise, if they would now shew the
like manlie courage against them, as they had shewed before in assailing the other. Manie
other woords he vsed in admonishing them to fight manfullie, till the onset giuen by the enimies caused him to make an end.</p>
<p>The Saxons laid about them so stoutlie in the beginning, that they forced their aduersaries,

with whome they were matched, to giue backe. Neither did Edelfred faile in that occasion

<note place="marg">The Scots run awaie.</note>
made great slaughter in that wing of the Scots, with the which he incountred; so that finallie

through discomfort thereof to running awaie. There were slaine in this battell on the Scotishmens side, Brennius lieutenant or (as they termed him) thane of the Ile of Man, with Dungar
the kings third sonne, and no small number of other gentlemen beside. The king himselfe
scaped by helpe of his sonne, who staieng to get his father out of the preasse, was slaine (as
is said) amongst the residue. On the Saxons side, there was slaine Theobald Edelfreds brother, and Cutha the king of Westsaxons his sonne, as before ye haue heard, with a great
number of other. Edelfred himselfe lost one of his eies. Brudeus the Pictish king was hurt

<p>Thus Edelfred hauing got such a notable victorie at Deglastone in Britaine, he could not
be so contented, but eftsoones assembling his people, and ioining againe with Brudeus and
his Picts, the next summer after inuaded Galloway, and began to rob and spoile that cc mtrie,
to the end he might either inforce the inhabitants, with other the countries next therevnto adioining, to yeeld vnto him; either els to bring them into extreme pouertie in wasting all afore
him. But Aidan being aduertised h&eacute;ereof, sent to the Britains for their couenanted aid, and
comming forward with his owne people which he had assembled together, ouerthrew certeine

when the enimies were most at quiet, and (as was supposed) nothing in doubt of anie attempt
<note place="marg">The Scots and Britains dislodge.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots and Britains enter into Northumberland.</note>
to be made by the Scots and Britains in the night season, leauing a great number of fires
in their campe, they suddenlie dislodged, and passing the water by secret foords, they entred
into Cumberland, and so after passing into Northumberland, they wasted and destroied with
fire and swoord all that came within their reach: the report of which their dooings brought
Edelfred and Brudeus backe into that countrie to resist their inuasion, neither resting day nor
night, till they had got sight of their enimies.</p>
<p>The next day, the souldiers on both sides requiring battell, together they go with great
<note place="marg">The fight betwixt Scots and Britains on the one side, and Saxons and Picts on the other.</note>
noise and din both of men and instruments. Too much hardinesse in the Saxons caused no
small number of them to be slaine, rather choosing to die with reputation of manhood, than
to giue backe neuer so little ground to the enimie. Thus the battell continued for a space,
verie doubtfull which waie the victorie would incline. On the Britains and Scotishmens side,
there were foure chiefe rulers amongst them, beside Aidan himselfe, as Constantius and
Alencrinus Britains, Callan and Mordacke Scotishmen. Ech of these taking a seuerall charge
vpon him, did earnestlie applie their vttermost indeuors therin, incouraging their bands
to put awaie all cowardlie feare, and manfullie to sticke to their tackle, since by victorie
there was hope of eternall fame, beside suertie of life, and aduancement to the commonwealth of their countrie; where otherwise they might looke for nothing, but the contrarie
mishaps, as shame, rebuke, and importable seruitude. So that the Scotishmen and Britains
incouraged h&eacute;rewith, preassed vpon the enimies so fiercelie, that at length as well the Saxons
<note place="marg">The Saxons and Picts discomfited and chased.</note>
as Picts were compelled to breake their arraie, &amp; fall to plaine running awaie: the Scots
following so egerlie in the chase, that more of their enimies were thought to die in the flight,
than before there had doone in the battell.</p>
<p>S. Colme as yet being aliue, and within his monasterie in the lie of Iona, had knowledge
by diuine inspiration (as the Scotish chronicles make mention) of all these matters how
they went : and at the verie time that the battels were in sight together, he had assembled a
companie of verie vertuous and godlie disposed persons, making intercession for the prosperous speed of their king the foresaid Aidan : and at the verie instant (as it was knowne after)
that the Saxons began to fl&eacute;e (as they which had the ouerthrow) that holie old father shewed
great token of ioy and gladnesse, declaring vnto his brethren by the spirit of secret knowledge

therevpon to giue vnto God thanks for the same. There was an huge multitude slaine in this
conflict, but namelie the death of Ceuline king of the Westsaxons, with other two woorthie
capteins of that nation, made the slaughter more sorowfull on that side, the one of them was
called Cialine, and the other Quhitelline.</p>
<p>The day next after the battell, the spoile of the field being gathered together, all that
which was knowne to haue b&eacute;ene taken out of Galloway, and other countries of the Scots,
was restored by the kings authoritie vnto the owners againe. The residue which remained
<note place="marg">The diuision of the spoile.</note>
was diuided amongst the souldiers, the tenth part onelie excepted, which was distributed vnto
priests &amp; curats, to bestow the same vpon ornaments for their churches. The banners and
standards of the Saxons and Picts, with manie other rich offerings, king Aidan sent vnto the
abbeie of Colmekill, there to remaine as perpetuall monuments and tokens of so notable a victorie. The yeere next insuing, that holie father S. Colme now almost wasted through age,
<note place="marg">S. Colme departed out of this life.</note>

was no prince more glad than he to aduance them vnto honor.</p>
<p>By these and the like his princelie dooings, he was both beloued of his people and also feared,
He neither fauoured the Picts nor Saxons of Northumberland, for that the one nation being
ethniks, persisted in their infideltie, and the other ceassed not by all maner of means to support
them; but yet taking a truce with them both, he firmelie caused the same to be obserued. In
the tenth yeare of his reigne Cinigell king of Westsaxons &amp; Elfred king of Northumberland,
with aid of the Picts, vanquished Cadwallo king of Britains, and chased him into Scotland,

where he remained not long, sailing from thence into Britaine in France, and purchasing
aid of the king there named Cadoall, returned into Wales, where vanquishing his enimies
the Saxons, and sleaing manie thousands of them, he was restored againe vnto his kingdome. About the same time was Edelfred king of Northumberland slaine in battell, at a
place called Wintringham, not far from the riuer of Humber, by Redwald and Etheibreth,
the one being king of the cast Angles, and the other of the middle Angles; in reuenge of
such iniuries as the same Edelfred had doone vnto the Saxons of the countrie called Mercia,
conteining (as in the English historie more plainelie may appeare) all those shires from the riuer
of Thames vnto the riuer of Mers&eacute;e in Lancashire. Then was one Edwine a right christian
<note place="marg">Edwine.</note>
prince appointed to reigne in his place, by the assignement of the two forsaid kings Redwald
and Ethelbreth.</p>
<p>Whilest these things were a dooing, there were seuen sonnes of the aforesaid Edelfred, that
detesting the vntrue dealing of the Picts, which refused to aid their father in his necessitie, and
doubting to fall into the hands of Edwine, got them to Eugenius the Scotish king for more
suertie of their liues. Their names were Eufreid, Oswald, Oslaws, Oswin, Offas, Osmonda
and Osike. Ebba the onelie daughter of Edelfred being taken amongest other prisoners,
and, escaping from hir taker, miraculouslie got a bore in the riuer of Humber, and with the
same taking the sea alone, without all humane helpe (as hath b&eacute;ene reported) she sailed foorth,
&amp; at length safelie arriued at the point of land which stretched foorth into the sea, in the
mouth of the Forth, called euen vnto this day after hir name, saint Ebbes head, where being

receiued by the bishop of that diocesse, she was professed a nun, and after continuing in great
perfectnesse of obseruing that profession, she was instituted abbesse of hir house, shewing still

<p>Eugenius the Scotish king did louinglie receiue the sonnes of Edelfred, though their father
had euer b&eacute;ene a cruell enimie against the Scotish nation; and within a while after their comming into Scotland, hearing oftentimes the godlie sermons and preachings of the bishops and
moonks (who in those daies continuallie gaue themselues vnto that exercise) they finallie
abhorred their superstitious idolatrie, and receiued baptisme, that salutiferous signe and sacrament of our christian religion. Those churches also, which the Saxons in time of the warres
had ouerthrowen and destroied in Galloway and other countries thereabouts, Eugenius caused
to be repared; moreouer also he reedified sundrie castels in those marches, and placed in them
gaisons of souldiers, to defend them against all inuasions that might happen. Thus continuing his reigne the space of fift&eacute;ene yeares or thereabouts in honorable peace, to the great

<note place="marg"><date>620.</date></note>
buried amongest his elders in the Ile of Iona, within the monasterie of Colmekill.</p>
<p>About this time, that reuerend father and bishop Bonifacius Quirinus came foorth of Italie
<note place="marg">Bonifacius a godliepreacher.</note>
into Scotland, to instruct the people in the faith of Christ there. Whether he were pope, and
resigning vp the papalitie came thus into Scotland (as some haue supposed) or whether he was
sent from the pope called Bonifacius that succeeded Sauinianus, it is not certeinlie knowne; but
certeine it is, as the Scotish writers affirme, that vpon his first comming into Scotland he arriued
in the water of Taie, comming on land at the mouth of a little riuer, which diuideth the countrie of Gowrie from Angus. His name is yet famous amongest the Scots euen vnto this day,
for that he trauelled through the most part of the land, in preaching and instructing the people to their confirmation in the faith, and erecting diuers churches in the honor of almightie
God, which he dedicated to the name of saint Peter. And amongst other he built one at
the place where he came on land, an other at a village called Tulline, not passing three miles
from Dund&eacute;e, and the third at Restennoth, where afterwards an house of chanons of saint
Augustines order was builded. At length he came into Rosse, continuing there the residue of
his life, and is buried at Rossemarken.</p>
<p>There was also at the same time amongest the Scots an ancient godlie man named Molocke,
<note place="marg">Molocke a preacher.</note>
who following such rules &amp; doctrine as in his youth he had learned of Brandon that reuerend
abbat, he ceassed not to exhort the people of Mar and Argile (in which countries he was most
resident) to fl&eacute;e and forsake their vicious liuing, and to indeuour themselues to imbrace vertue,
<note place="marg">Moonks were preachers in those daies.</note>
to the comfort and health of their soules. This Molocke kept continuall companie with the
forenamed Bonifacius after his comming into Scotland: and finallie died also in Rosse, being
about 94 yeares of age, and was buried in the church where Bonifacius lieth, though they of
Argile say that his relikes rest among them in the church of Lismore, which is dedicated to
his name.</p>

be brought vp with Connane bishop of Sodore (that is, the bishop of Man) in vertuous discipline, did not altogither follow his godlie precepts and lessons. Ferquhard and Donald gladlie gaue eare to him, but they thought his instructions did not much apperteine vnto their birth
and degr&eacute;e: but Fiacre printing his diuine documents d&eacute;epelie in his heart, determined to forsake all worldlie pompe and dignitie, and to get him some whither farre from home, where he
might serue God more fr&eacute;elie without let or interruption of his friends or kinsfolke. Thus

so that by means of other arbitrators which they chose by common agr&eacute;ement, all matters in
controuersie were taken vp &amp; ended betwixt them, the king not once made priuie therevnto.</p>
<p>At the same time it was noised abroad in the realme, that Ferquhard, besides other his
<note place="marg">King Ferquhard infected with the Pelagian error.</note>
wicked behauiours, was also infected with the erronious opinions of the Pelagian heresie.
Which suspicion was the more increased, for that he vsed to haue sundrie British priests in
his companie: the which nation had b&eacute;ene euer noted with the spot of that damnable infection.
The nobilitie of the realme mooued herewith, summoned him by an herald to come to a

councell, which they had appointed to hold of all the states, that they might there vnderstand, if
it were true or not which was commonlie reported of him. But he refusing to come at such
summons, they assembled togither, and besieged him in the castell wherein he had inclosed
himselfe, and winning the place, got him into their hands, and immediatlie therevpon 
<note place="marg">He is taken prisoner.</note>
committed him to safe k&eacute;eping. This doone, they consult togither for the administration of the

<note place="marg">Fiacre his praier.</note>
they rest vpon this agr&eacute;ement, to send an honorable ambassage into France vnto Fiacre, to
require him to returne home into his countrie, and there to receiue the gouernement of the
realme.</p>
<p>Fiacre (as the report goeth) hearing that there were diuers of the Scotish nobilitie comming
towards him vpon this message, in his praiers desired feruentlie of almightie God, that it might
please him so to woorke for him, that he might continue in his contemplatiue life still, and
not be occasioned to resort vnto the troubles of the world, which all contemplatiue godlie
men ought to abhorre. And euen as he had wished, it came to passe. For when those
that were sent vnto him, came to the heremitage wherein he had his lodging, they found him
(as appeared vnto them) so disfigured with the leprosie, that vpon his earnest refusall to forsake his solitarie life (which he professed to lead as an heremite) for anie worldlie preferment
of kinglie gouernement, they were content to returne with that answere, sith his infirmitie (as
they supposed) was such, as was not conuenient for him that should haue anie publike gouernement. This Fiacre had a sister named Sira, which hearing of hir brothers vertuous
trade of life, came vnto him with a companie of godlie virgins, and being of him confirmed in
hir purposed intent of chastitie, she repaired into Champaigne in France, where she with hir
fellowes remained in great holinesse of life, leauing in those parties a woorthie memorie not
forgotten amongest them there till this day.</p>
<p>The foresaid ambassadours returning foorth of France, declared in what plight of deformitie they had s&eacute;ene Fiacre, and how earnestlie he had refused the offer which they had made
vnto him in name of all the states of Scotland. The Scotish nobilitie herevpon assembling togither, chose foorth foure of the ancientest peeres amongest them, to haue the rule and gouernement of the kingdome, till it were otherwise prouided. These were named by that age,
wardens, and had full authoritie to order things as s&eacute;emed them good in all points. In the

of his predecessor Ferquhard, by means whereof he quicklie grew into great fauor of his
subiects. In the meane time Cadwallo king of the Britains, and Penda king of those Englishmen which inhabited that part of England ancientlie called Mercia, ioining their powers
togither against Edwin king of Northumberland, depriued him both of life and kingdome.
<note place="marg">King Edwin is slaine.</note>
After this, passing through the whole countrie, and entring into the confines of Pictland,
they tooke a great part of the same by force of arms from Brudeus king of the Picts, who
in vaine had sued for aid vnto Donwald king of Scotland, for that his vntruth had beene
notified more than inough in times past. But Donwald being certified of Edwins death,
made means vnto Cadwallo king of the Britains by his ambassadours, that Eufred the son
of Edelfred might be restored vnto his fathers kingdome, which Edwin had wrongfullie
vsurped.</p>
<p>This being granted, Eufred leauing his brethren still in Scotland, came into Northumberland, where by authoritie of Cadwallo and Penda he was inuested king of Bernicia, that is,
of the countrie which is now called the marches. For at the same time they had diuided
the kingdome of Northumberland into two kingdomes, appointing Eufred (as is said) to

<note place="marg">Osrike an infidell.</note>
reigne ouer the one called Bernicia, and one Osrike ouer the other called Deira, a man of
great wickednesse, as by his woorks most plainelie appeared. For certeine yeares after his
aduancement to that dignitie, he found means to marie one of his daughters vnto the foresaid
Eufred, persuading the same Eufred to consent with him in restoring againe the hethenish
religion throughout their whole dominion, &amp; vtterlie to renounce the christian faith, which
they had latelie before receiued by the instructions of the two bishops Conan &amp; Pauline.
But they inioied not long felicitie after so wicked and most diuelish a purpose, for the
princes of Albion vnder the leading of Cadwallo K. of the Britains, and Penda king of
Mercia, with a great armie assembled of Saxons, Britains, and Picts, entring into Northumberland, and incountring in battell with Osrike and Eufred, discomfited their power, and
tooke them prisoners, who being put into a common prison, slue each other to auoid sharper
tortures, which by due execution they dailie looked for.</p>
<p>Then was the kingdome of Northumberland giuen vnto Oswald brother to Eufred, both
in respect of the right which he had thereto, and also of the zeale which he bare to the
aduancement of Christes religion, shewing himselfe in consideration thereof, an earnest
enimie to his brother Eufred, and all his partakers, in so much that in the day of the battell,
he was one of the forwardest capteins against them. Vnto this Oswald was sent a Scotishman called Corman, to instruct the Northumberland men in faith, and after him Aidan, as
in the English historie ye may read more at large: finallie he was slaine by Penda king of
Mercia, as in the same historie appeareth. His death chanced in the third yeare of Donwald

<p>About the same time there liued in France thr&eacute;e brethren of great holinesse of life, being
sonnes vnto Philtan king of Ireland, the which he begot of his wife Galghetes, descended
of the linage of the kings in Scotland. The names of which thr&eacute;e brethren were as followeth, Furseus, Foilanus, and Vltanus. Furseus professing himselfe a moonke of saint
Benets order, passed ouer into France, there to set foorth and inlarge that profession, and
being receiued of king Clowis, began the foundation of a monasterie there called Latinie, in
the which he placed moonks of that order, and began to sow in those parties the seeds of
the gospell, but not without the darnell of mens traditions, as Iohn Bale saith in the 14
centurie of the British writers. His two brethren Foilan and Vltan followed him ouer into
France, and both by word and example instructed the Frenchmen to imbrace the faith of
Christ, and to renounce the religion of the gentiles.</p>

<p>So that it s&eacute;emeth as yet, such as professed themselues to be moonks, and men of religion
(as they were called) had not left off to labour in the Lords vineyard, spending their time
in reading the scriptures, to instruct and teach others, and to exercise praier and thanksgiuing: so as no small number by their wholesome doctrine and good example were conuerted to the christian faith. Foilan at length was martyred in a monasterie which he had

them in Albion for k&eacute;eping of the Easter day, the Scotish bishops and some of the Britains
varieng in their account from all other prelats of the west: but at length through persuasion
of the pope they confessed their error (if it ought so to be taken) and consented to celebrate
that feast according to the account of other nations. These things chanced in the daies of

<div n="Ferquhard" type="section">
<head>FERQUHARD.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">AFTER</hi> the deceasse of Donwald, his nephue Ferquhard the sonne of his brother, the
<note place="marg">Ferquhard the second of that name created king of Scotland.</note>

<note place="marg">Ferquhard being king was couetous: before he was king, he shewed liberalitie.</note>
other Ferquhard, succ&eacute;eded in gouernement of the realme, a man of quicke and liuelie spirit,
but inclined neuerthelesse rather vnto euill than vnto good, speciallie after he had atteined
the crowne, insomuch as it was commonlie spoken of him, that from a liberall and most
gentle humane person, he was suddenlie changed into an insatiable and most cruell monster.
Before he came to the crowne he was liberall beyond measure. There was no gentleman
that wanted monie, either to red&eacute;eme his lands ingaged, or to bestow in dower for the
mariage of his daughter, but if he had wherewith to helpe him, he might account himselfe
sure thereof. Priests and other deuout persons, speciallie such as were poore and in any
necessitie, he oftentimes most bountifullie relieued to their great ease and comfort. To be
briefe, such a readinesse was in him to helpe all men, that (as was thought) he could better
be contented to want himselfe, than to s&eacute;e other men haue n&eacute;ed of anie thing that was in
his possession, so that all men iudged him most worthie of all princelie authoritie. But
after he was once placed in the kinglie seat, he so altered his conditions, that men could not
but woonder much therat. Where before he was knowne to be liberall, well desposed,
righteous, sober, and a reformer of offenses, he was now foorthwith become couetous, wicked
towards God, a tormentor of the iust and righteous people, and insatiable in all vnawfull
affections. That which before time he had giuen vnto anie of the nobilitie, he now without
<note place="marg">Gifts are required as a loane.</note>

<note place="marg">Lo, what a pretense couetousnes hath.</note>

<note place="marg">For their goods sake prelats are troubled.</note>
all shame most vncourteouslie demanded to be to him restored, alledging that he did but
lend it for the time. And such as went about to delay restitution, pretending anie excuse,
he caused their goods to be confiscate, and also their bodies to be committed to prison.
Now &amp; then he found means without cause or matter to put some of them to cruell death.
Such of the prelates as h&eacute;e vnderstood to be wealthie, he rested not till he had piked one
matter or other vnto them, whereby they were sure to forfeit all their treasure vnto his
coffers, that neuer might be filled.</p>
<p>The bishops of the realme, namelie those two reuerend fathers, Colman and Finnan, 
<note place="marg">The king is excommunicated.</note>
perceiuing such wickednesse in the prince, blamed him sharpelie sundrie times for the same:
and at length bicause they saw he regarded not their admonishments, he was by them excommunicated: whereof he so little passed, that when other went vnto the church to heare
diuine seruice, he would get him to the woods and forrests to hunt the hart, or some other
<note place="marg">The king is hunting.</note>
game. Neither were such wanting as were willing to k&eacute;epe him companie: so readie is the
nature of man at all times to follow licentious libertie. He vsed also, contrarie to the custome of his countrie, to eat thr&eacute;e meales a day, hauing such number of dishes and 
<note place="marg">He was a glutton.</note>
abundance of delicate fare, as the like had not b&eacute;ene vsed at anie time before those daies in
that realme: and all to serue his gr&eacute;edie appetite, togither with theirs that followed his
companie.</p>
<p>Of wines &amp; other strong drinks he would participate abundantlie at all times and places,
<note place="marg">A drunkard he was also.</note>
without regard of health or honor, being exc&eacute;edinglie giuen vnto most beastlie

drunkennesse. He customablie vsed to sit at supper till it were verie late in the night, hauing his
banketting dishes and cuppes to come in one after another, till he were so mistempered, that
being laid to sleepe, he would streight vomit out such heauie gorges, as he had in such
most gluttonous wise receiued. Herevnto he was so drowned in the filthie lust of the flesh,
that he defiled his owne daughters: and for that his wife was about to dissuade him from
such villanie, he slue hir with his owne hands. Thus continuing in his wickednesse certeine
yeeres, at length the nobles began to conspire against him, so that they would haue deuised
a meane how to haue rid him out of the way, if bishop Colman had not forbidden them
that practise, prophesieng as it were by diuine inspiration, that Ferquhard sore detesting his
<note place="marg">A prophesie.</note>
owne wicked dooings, should shortlie be punished by the hands of almightie God, according
to his deseruings.</p>
<p>And sure his words proued true: for within a moneth after, as the same Ferquhard
<note place="marg">The king is sicke.</note>
followed in chase of a woolfe, the beast being all inraged by the pursute of the hounds, flue
backe vpon the king, and snatching at him, did wound and bite him right sore in one of his
sides, immediatlie wherevpon, whether through anguish of his hurt, or by some other occasion, he fell into a most filthie disease: for a venemous humor with a soft consuming
heat, did so eat and wast his members and lims, that a lothsome sight it was to behold the
same: for out of his legs, f&eacute;et, and priuie parts, there issued filthie corruption and matter,
with so vile a sauour, that vnneth might any creature abide it. His bellie was swollen, as
though he had beene infected with the dropsie, and therto was it verie hard withall. Finallie
lice bred so abundantlie in his secret parts, that he might in no wise be rid or cleansed of
them.</p>
<p>At length, when he had b&eacute;ene vexed in this sort for the space of two y&eacute;eres togither, or
thereabouts, he began to call himselfe to remembrance, and to consider how this punishment was worthilie fallen vpon him for his sinnes, and therevpon causing bishop Colman to
<note place="marg">He sent for his confessor.</note>
be fetched vnto him, being as then about 20 miles off, he confessed vnto him the whole
summe of his offenses, declaring himselfe right penitent for the same. Colman reioising
hereat, did not onelie release him of the sentence of excommunication, pronounced against
<note place="marg">The king being excommunicated is released.</note>
him; but also willed him to be of comfort, and to put his confidence in the mercie of
almightie God, who was readie to receiue all such sinners as turned vnto him with repentant
hearts: so that being put in hope by these &amp; the like words of Colman to haue forgiuenesse
of his sinnes, with bitter teares he besought God to haue mercie vpon him: and humblie
receiuing the sacrament, got him into simple clothing of heare and sackecloth. Then causing
himselfe to be borne into the next fields, h&eacute;e there yelded vp the ghost in the presence of

Colman, who (according to the dutie of a good ghostlie father) was still about him, in exhorting him to commit himselfe wholie to the mercie of God, &amp; not to doubt but he should
be sure to atteine the same. Thus Ferquhard ended his life, in the 18 y&eacute;ere after he began
his reigne ouer the Scotishmen, and in the y&eacute;ere of Grace 664.</p>

<note place="marg">A louer of peace &amp; iustice.</note>
buried in Colmekill, he was inuested king: which function he right sufficientlie discharged,
studieng to mainteine peace with his neighbors the Picts, Saxons and Britains: giuing thereby
a good example to be followed of his subiects. Hereto he had a speciall care for the administration of the lawes in due forme and order, causing offendors to be punished, that other
harmelesse persons might liue in quiet, so that by this meanes all things in the beginning of
his reigne had prosperous successe. Afterwards there fell no small discord betwixt them
<note place="marg">Lennox and Argile are at variance.</note>
of Lennox and Argile: for first through bralling among the heardmen, their maisters made
a fraie, whereof rose such deadlie enimitie betwixt the parties, by reason that the inhabitants
of the westerne Iles aided them of Argile, and the people of Galloway the other of Lennox:
<note place="marg">The westerne Iles take part with Argile, Galoway with Lennox.</note>
that if the king had not come into those parties to appease the businesse, and to haue

<p>The king at his arriuall amongst them minded not to pursue the people that followed

<note place="marg">The capteins becam friends togither, and fled into the Iles.</note>

<note place="marg">The Ilandmen apprehend the capteins of the rebels.</note>
their capteins, but rather the capteins and authors of this tumult themselues. Whereof they
hauing knowledge, made an attonement togither, being inforced thereto of necessitie, so to
auoid the prepared punishment deuised by the king against them. And foorthwith they
fled ouer into the Iles, but the inhabitants doubting the kings displeasure, would not consent
to succour them, but contrariwise tooke them and deliuered them to the kings officers, wherevpon they were safelie conueied to the places where they were borne, and there suffered
their deserued execution. Thus that commotion vnaduisedlie begun, was sp&eacute;edilie appeased,
and the name of Maldwin by reason h&eacute;ereof so feared amongst his subiects, that during his
reigne no such trouble chanced in anie part of all his dominions.</p>
<p>After this he went ouer into Iona or Colmekill, where perceiuing the abbeie church,
<note place="marg">He buildeth the church of the abbeie of Colmekill.</note>
wherein his ancestors had their sepultures, to be in decaie, he caused it to be pulled quite
downe, and woorkemen foorthwith set in hand to build it vp againe, at his owne proper
costes and charges. Such sp&eacute;ed also was vsed about this woorke, that before he departed
out of this life, the same was finished, and dedicated vnto our Sauior Christ, and saint Colme.
About the same time there reigned throughout the most part of the world a sore and
<note place="marg">A great pestilence &amp; death vpon earth.</note>
gr&eacute;cuous pestilence, consuming a greater number of men (before it ceassed) than there were
left aliue: for it continued the whole space of thr&eacute;e yeeres togither. At length, through
common praier, fastings, giuing of almes, &amp; other vertuous woorks, the wrath of almightie
God was pacified, so that such great mortalitie by his mercifull appointment did staie and
giue ouer.</p>
<p>The Scotishmen were fr&eacute;e from that infection as well at that time, as also for manic y&eacute;eres

omitting the ancient and wholesome sparenesse of diet, which their fathers in times past had
vsed, they fell vnto riotous banketting and excessiue f&eacute;eding, whereby they became subiect vnto
all kinds of diseases, through malicious humors growing thervpon. Colman bishop of Lindesferne s&eacute;eing woonderfull numbers of Englishmen perish dailie of that contagious sicknesse,

<p>After the departure of Colman foorth of Northumberland, the people of that countrie
ioining with the Picts, made sundrie roads into the Scotish borders: which iniurie when
Maldwine reuenged with more displeasure doone to them of Northumberland, than the
Scotishmen had receiued, it caused the Picts and Northumbers to prepare themselues with

hauing heard the ambassadors which were thus sent, feined as though he had b&eacute;ene willing

space of 11 moneths, in which meane time he might make his preparation. Eugenius
hauing some secret knowledge of Egfreds purpose, prouided likewise for the warres on his

<p>In the tenth moneth Egfred hauing all his preparation readie, sent a companie of his
men of war into the Scotish borders, to fetch some bootie, whereby the peace might be

broken. Those that were thus sent, fetched not onelie from thence a great number of
cattell, but also slue diuers of the borderers that went about to rescue their beasts and cattell.
Immediatlie herevpon were sent ambassadors from Eugenius to demand restitution: but
<note place="marg">Ambassadors sent by Eugenius vnto Egfred for restitution.</note>
they not without much adoo, after certeine daies attendance, got audience, and boldlie declaring vnto Egfred their message, receiued for answer a plaine publication of warre. For
he alledging how the Scots, since the truce was granted, had sundrie times fetched booties
out of the confines of his dominions, and therefore had well deserued farre more damage
than as yet they had receiued, wherevpon he minded not to continue friendship with them
that knew not how to k&eacute;epe their hands from robbing and stealing from their neighbours:
so that he commanded them to declare vnto their king, that within eight daies after, he

should looke for open warre at the hands of him and other his alies.</p>
<p>Eugenius receiuing this answer from Egfred, besought God, sith the other onelie sought
to violate the peace, that the vengeance might light vpon his owne head, that had thus giuen
the occasion. H&eacute;erewith gathering his power togither, he repaired into Galloway, into the
<note place="marg">Eugenius gathereth an armie.</note>
which he had knowledge that his enimies would first enter. But before he could get thither,
a great armie of Englishmen were come alreadie into that countrie, and had besieged a
strong castell called Downske, the chiefest fortresse in those daies of all Galloway. And
<note place="marg">The castell of Downske besieged.</note>
yer Egfred might winne the same, he was constreined to raise his siege, and to march foorth

<p>At the first there was no great aduantage perceiued on either side, the kings, according
to the duties of valiant capteins, exhorting their people to sticke to it manfullie: but in the
meane time, certeine bands of Egfreds part getting themselues to the side of an bill, gaue
the looking on, without comming downe at all to aid their friends: which manner the residue of his people perceiuing, doubted of some treason deuised against them, and therevpon

<note place="marg">King Egfred slaine.</note>

<note place="marg">S&eacute;e more h&eacute;ereof in England.</note>
with an arrow so sore that immediatlie he fell downe and died in the place. The Englishmen discouraged with this mischance, were quicklie therevpon put to flight and chased, a
great number of them tooke the riuer so to escape the enimies hands, of whome the more
part being pressed downe by weight of their armor, were drowned in the raging waues of
the floud, the residue by casting from them their armors and clothes, escaped by swimming
ouer to the other side, but those that made their course by land, being cumbred in mires
and mosses, also amongst streicts, rocks, mounteins and cliffes, were ouertaken by the
Scots and slaine. Few of that number escaped awaie in safetie, so that there died in the

<p>Brudeus the Pictish king hauing knowledge of this slaughter, which had chanced betwixt

of S. Cutbert (who then held the s&eacute;e of Lindesferne) preserued the people from that present

chanced to fall at variance amongst themselues for parting of the spoile, and buckling togither by the eares, there was an huge slaughter made amongst them. And this was the
<note place="marg">A slaughter amongst the Picts.</note>
cause, that contenting themselues with those countries about Berwike, ancientlie called Deira,
out of the which they expelled the Saxons, they absteined from all the residue, as not willing to deale withall. Neither were the Saxons of Northumberland, being thus scourged,

Adannan (with whome he was brought vp) &amp; of S. Cutbert, he entered into league with the
Northumberland men: but he would at no hand ioine in amitie with the Picts, notwithstanding he was contented to take truce with them. But when he saw the same oftentimes
by them violated &amp; broken, to the great perill, damage, and hinderance of his subiects, he
caused the warre to be proclamed, and sent them his defiance by an herald. Howbeit,
through the earnest praiers (as is supposed) of the two bishops, Cutbert and Adannan
(who had laboured earnestlie to haue brought those people to a quietnesse) this warre continued without anie notable incounter, saue onelie by light incursions (wherein no great

To be briefe, when he tooke nothing in hand woorthie of his estate and degr&eacute;e, it was thought that of necessitie the forme of the publike gouernement must n&eacute;edes thorough his negligent slouthfulnesse fall into decaie and ruine: wherevpon Garnard king of the

made verie pitifull slaughter of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>At length Ambirkeleth (being sore blamed of his nobles for his negligence, in suffering his
<note place="marg">Ambirkeleth gathered an armie against the Picts.</note>
subiects thus to be destroied) gathered an armie togither, &amp; with no small feare to shew his
head amongst his people (as those princes which through their owne default haue their people in mistrust, doo euer stand in doubt of their owne safeties, and namelie when anie present
danger beginneth to app&eacute;ere) foorth he goeth without anie great good order (God wot) for
what might be looked for at his hands, which was so ouerwhelmed with all kind of excessiue
gluttonie, immoderate surfeting, insatiable lecherie, and deliting altogither in slouthfull ease,
<note place="marg">Idlenesse the br&eacute;eder and nourisher of sensuall lusts.</note>
and sluggish idlenesse, the root from whence all such filthie vices taking their beginnings, are
nourished &amp; mainteined.</p>
<p>To conclude, he liued as one that tooke no maner of regard to that which chieflie apperteined to his calling: whereby now when he should come into the field, he was neither able
through lacke of practise to take paines to s&eacute;e things doone as was behouefull, of himself,
neither yet to giue order to others how the same ought to be doone. Neuerthelesse marching forward with his armie, he came to the water of Tay, and neere to the banks thereof, he
pitched downe his tents, where after he had supped, he was occasioned to go foorth of his
lodging to doo the necessities of nature, and being onelie accompanied with two of his seruants that were groomes of his chamber, he was suddenlie shot through the head with an arrow, but from whence it came, or who shot it, there was neuer anie knowne that could tell.
Howbeit, the king immediatlie died of the hurt, after he had reigned not fullie two y&eacute;eres.

<p>The bond of peace begun betwixt the kings, was the more stronglie confirmed by meanes

was acquit, to the great reioising of all honest men. Those that had doone the d&eacute;ed, were

persons were cruellie tormented here in your presence; had not wrath giuen place, partlie vnto

pricks as may rest in a woman, to wit, impatient forbearing of carnall lust, &amp; irefull wrath.
Ferguse by his continuall vsing of concubines, kept from me the due debt that the husband
oweth to the wife: wherevpon when there was no hope to reconcile him with often aduertisements, vehement force of anger rising in my hart, droue me to doo so wicked a d&eacute;ed. I
thought rather therefore to dispatch the adulterer, than (being destitute of my husband, &amp; defrauded of all qu&eacute;enelie honor) to liue still subiect to the perpetuall iniuries of such lewd

with his people vnto flight, chased them to such a streict, as where there was no way to get
foorth, saue onlie that by which they entered. This place is in Lorne, with a streict passage

former state of quietnesse. Yet after the appeasing of this tumult, there chanced a new businesse
in Galloway: for Gillequhalme, sonne to that Donald, which (as ye haue heard) was executed by commandement of Eugenius the eight, gathered togither a great number of vngratious scape thrifts, &amp; did much hurt and misch&eacute;efe in the countrie. But shortlie after, being
vanquished by the same capteins that had suppressed the other rebels of the Iles, the countrie
was rid of that trouble, and the ring-leaders punished by death for their offenses. In this
meane while, the Englishmen &amp; Welsh Britains through multitude of kings and rulers warring each against other, had no leasure to attempt anie enterprise against strangers. Neither
were the Picts fr&eacute;e of some secret displeasues, which one part of them had conceiued against
another, so that the Scotishmen were not troubled at all by anie forreine enimies. And so

<p><hi rend="smallcap">THEN</hi> after Soluathius was once buried in Colmekill amongst his ancestors, Achaius the
<note place="marg">Achaius created king of Scotland.</note>
son of king Ethfine (a man highlie renowmed for his earnest zeale to iustice and vpright dealing) was aduanced to the gouernance of the realme: who for that by his former conuersation
amongst the nobilitie, he perfectlie vnderstood what grudge and secret hatred remained in their
harts, one wishing anothers destruction; he foresaw what danger the common-wealth stood
in, if the same were not by some good meanes qualified : and thervpon calling them togither,
<note place="marg">He maketh the nobilitie to agr&eacute;e.</note>
he handled the matter with such wisedome and dexteritie, that before their departure
from him, all the roots of former displeasures being vtterlie extirped and auoided, they
were made friends on ech side, and promised in his presence so to continue. Thus hauing
laid the foundation of a quiet state amongst his subiects, now in the beginning of his reigne,
h&eacute;e was at point to haue had no small warres with the Irishmen: for a number of them being
arriued in Cantire, were there slaine by them of the westerne Iles, which vpon request of the
inhabitants of that countrie were come to aid them against those Irishmen.</p>
<p>This losse the rulers of the Irish nation purposed in all hast to reuenge vpon them of the
Iles. But Achaius hearing thereof, sent ouer an ambassage vnto them, to haue the matter
taken vp before anie further force were vsed: alledging how there was no cause wherfore
warres should be mooued for such a matter, where the occasion had b&eacute;ene giuen but by a sort
of rouers on either side, without commandement or warrant obteined from anie of their superiors. Howbeit the nobles of Ireland (for there was no king amongest them at that time as it
<note place="marg">The Irishmen will reuenge.</note>
chanced) mooued altogither with indignation for the slaughter of their countrimen, made a direct
answer, that they would suerlie be reuenged of the reproch which they had receiued, before they
would common of anie peace. And therefore whilest the Scotish ambassadors returned out
of Ireland with this answer, a great number of them in ships and craiers passed ouer into Ila,
<note place="marg">Irishmen take a preie in Ila.</note>
where getting togither a great preie, and fraughting their vessels therewith, as they were returning homewards, they were soonke by force of tempest, so that neither ship nor man returned to bring tidings home how they had sped in Scotland.</p>
<p>The stout stomachs of the Irish lords and rulers being well qualified with this mischance,
<note place="marg">Irishmen doo s&eacute;eke peace.</note>
they were glad to s&eacute;eke for peace shortlie after vnto Achaius. Those also that were sent
ouer to treat of the same, found him at Enuerlochth&eacute;e; where hauing declared their message,
&amp; confessed how iustlie they had b&eacute;ene punished by the righteous iudgement of almightie
God, for the wrongfull attempting of the warres against them that had not deserued it :
Achaius answered, how the Irish nation was so stubborne, that they knew not how to vse
reason, except they were throughlie scourged: and therefore had the righteous God taken
iust reuenge vpon them, to the example of other, for their contumacie, in moouing warres
against them that had so earnestlie sought for peace. Neuerthelesse, setting apart all iniuries
past, as well new as old, to shew himselfe to be the follower of Christ, who in so manic passages
had praised, commended, and set foorth vnto vs peace and tranquillitie, he was contented to
grant them peace, which now they sued for. Thus was the peace renewed betwixt the Scotish and Irish nations, to the no lesse comfort of the Scots themselues, than of the Irishmen,
as those that had learned now by experience and triall (hauing inioied peace a good season)
how much the same was to be preferred before cruell warres.</p>
<p>In this meane time, Charles surnamed the great, as then reigning in France, and 
<note place="marg">Carolus Magnus in league with the Scots.</note>
vnderstanding how the Englishmen did not onelie by dailie rouing disquiet the seas, to the great
danger of all such merchants and other as trauelled alongst the coasts of France and Germanie; but also now and then comming on land vpon the French dominions, did manie notable
displeasures to his subiects: he thought good by the aduise of his p&eacute;eres to conclude a league
(if it were possible) with the Scots and Picts, with this article amongst the residue: That so oft
as the Englishmen should attempt any enterprise or inuasion into France, the Scots and Picts
should be readie streightwaies to inuade them here at home; and when they should make

<pb n="186"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"186"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

anie warres against the Scots or Picts, then the Frenchmen should take vpon them to inuade
the west parts of England.</p>
<p>There were sent therefore from Charles vnto Achaius certeine ambassadors to bring this
<note place="marg">Ambassadors sent into Scotland.</note>
matter to passe, who arriuing in Scotland, and comming to the kings presence, declared effectuallie the summe of their message, shewing that the conclusion of such a league should
bee no lesse to the wealth of the Frenchmen, than of the Scots (considering Englishmen to be
a people most desirous of all other to get into their hands other mens goods and possessions)
for thereby they might be somewhat restreined from such bold and iniurious enterprises, as
they dailie tooke in hand against their christian neighbors : but it should make most of all
(say they) for the aduancement of the whole christian common-wealth, whereas otherwise
through their insolent dooings, such force as was alreadie prepared against the Saracens (the
common enimies of the christians) should be called backe, therewith to k&eacute;epe off the said Englishmen, to the great danger of those parts of christendome, vpon which the Saracens then
bordered as neighbors.</p>
<p>This message being heard with good deliberation by such as were present, the ambassadors
<note place="marg">The ambassadors are honorablie interteined.</note>
themselues being honorable personages, and graue of countenance, were receiued most louinglie of the king, and lodged in his owne palace, hauing all the cheere and honorable interteinment that might be deuised : but touching their message, there were sundrie disputations
amongst the nobles, whether the concluding of such a league as they required, were expedient for the Scotish common-wealth or not. And for that the matter seemed to be doutfull, the
king thought it necessarie to haue the aduise of his councell : and therevpon calling them togither, and appointing diuerse of them to go with the ambassadors on hunting, to shew them
some sport, whilest he consulted with the residue (bicause he would not haue them present)
he commanded one Colman, gouernor of Mar (a man of great authoritie amongst the Scotishmen for his approoued wisedome) to say first his mind touching the request of those French
ambassadors, who therevpon standing foorth, began as followeth.</p>
<p>"No man ought to maruell, I perceiue, king Achaius, if manie of this our nation be desirous to haue this league concluded with the Frenchmen, as they that are persuaded how nothing
can be better, nothing more profitable, more honorable, or more pleasant to almightie God,
than to ioine in league and friendship with a nation of greatest power and wealth in these daies,
of all other within the bounds of Europe : for by that meanes should the Scotish name be
<note place="marg">Due considerations.</note>
highlie renowmed and spoken of through the whole world. But trulie these considerations
contenting so well at the first, are not so much to be regarded as the euiis which hereafter
may grow therevpon : for suerlie a naughtie and pernicious end of this determination shall
euidentlie teach vs (though too late) how farre we haue gone beside the way of reason in establishing this league, if we once consent to conclude the same. Is it anie other thing (I bes&eacute;ech you) to make a league, and to ioine in societie with the Frenchmen against our 
<note place="marg">An enimie at haud.</note>

<note place="marg">Friends farre off.</note>
neighbors the Englishmen (whose friendship might be most expedient for vs) than euen to haue
from hencefoorth a neere and in maner a domesticall enimie at hand, whereas our supposed
friends shall be farre off from vs, and separated from our countrie by a great and large sea, at
whose plesure also we must make wars against our neighbors, and fight for other mens safegards, putting our bodies in hazard of death and wounding for their cause, which dwell nothing n&eacute;ere vs; yea &amp; in their quarell to commit our kingdome, goods and liues vnto extreme
perill of vtter destruction ? I would thinke it good therefore to take better aduisement and 
<note place="marg">Good counsell of Colman.</note>
deliberation herein, least whilest we s&eacute;eke for vaine glorie and counterfeit honor, we doo not,
through prouoking the Englishmen our next neighbors, lose our owne liberties got with much
trauell by our elders, for the which they so often fought with the Britains, Romans, Picts, and
finallie with the Saxons. Can there be anie thing more pernicious vnto a fr&eacute;e nation, and
people borne in libertie, than to measure lawes of peace, chances of warre, and in fine libertie
it selfe, by the lust and pleasure of another nation, and so to enter (as it were) into bondage ?
For the auoiding whereof, not onelie men, but also all other liuing things are readie to fight,
euen to the vttermost. If the Frenchmen in the chiefest heat and most earnest brunt of the warre

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"(which"</fw>-->

<pb n="187"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"187"</fw>-->

(which we shall take in hand for their sake, according to the articles of the league) shall
chance to forsake vs, and conclude some manner of peace or league with our enimies,
leauing vs in all the whole danger; shall we haue anie iudge afore whome we maie bring
them to answer for their default, and by whose authoritie they may be constreined to see
vs satisfied for such losse and iniuries as we shall happily susteine at the Englishmens hands ?
Are we of that force and power to reuenge our wrongs vpon them, after we are vanquished
and in maner brought to vtter confusion by those warres which we shall enter into for
their cause ? If euer we be brought vnto that point (as God forbid we should) that through
want of substance, and decaie of force, the Frenchmen shall also vtterlie forsake vs, &amp; that
thereby we shall not b&eacute;e able to resist the English puissance: afore whome (I bes&eacute;ech you)
shall we accuse them for breaking of this league ? We shall dailie haue to doo with our
enimies after the conclusion of the league (if it be concluded at all) and but seldome times
with our friends. In the midst of our enimies we shall be still occasioned to practise for
our defense, where we haue a long way both by sea and land to passe ouer to our friends, in
case anie n&eacute;ed shall inforce vs therevnto: commodities are brought vs out of Spaine, France,
and Germanie, not such as we desire, but onelie such as the Englishmen doo permit.
Againe, when our merchants shall passe into France, what hauens shall we leaue them to
resort vnto in time of dangerous tempests, which often chance to all such as vse sailing ?
Either must they perish and be cast away through rage of seas, either else fall into the hands
of our enimies togither, with all their goods and fraught. What discommodities hereof
shall rise, your grace (most prudent prince) and you right circumspect councellors, doo
well inough perceiue. I therefore would thinke it expedient, that we should continue in
the former peace concluded with the Britains, Saxons, and Picts, according to the custome
of our late predecessors, who saw well inough what was most beneficiall for the wealth of
the Scotish nation, and not to couet a new amitie with an vnknowne people, hauing deserued little or nothing as yet at our hands (whose intent I cannot but haue in suspicion,
sith they s&eacute;eke for amitie so farre off) except we shall manifestlie resolue with our selues
to imploie and ieopard both life and libertie for the safegard of the French, without regard
of our owne." &para; Manie in that assemblie shewed themselues sore offended with Colmans
<note place="marg">Colmans counsell is misliked.</note>
woords, supposing the league with the Frenchmen to be both honorable and necessarie.</p>
<p>Then one Albian, a man of great nobilitie (whome the king had latelie before instituted
his lieutenant in the Iles) spake in this manner. "If it were possible that there might be
<note place="marg">Albian his oration.</note>
one sure and inuiolable consent amongst those foure people, which at this daie haue their
habitations within the bounds of Albion, or that the Englishmen knew what it were to stand
and abide by faith and promises made and giuen, we would not denie but that those considerations and aduises which Colman hath h&eacute;ere vttered, ought to be followed; bicause that
then there should be no occasion at all, why we should conclude anie league with anie
forren nation. But forsomuch as there was neuer man that found more vntruth and breach
<note place="marg">The English Saxons breakers of promise.</note>
of promise in anie nation, than hath b&eacute;ene found in these Saxons (the which hauing got
the rule in Albion, are now called Englishmen) as the Scots, Picts, and Britains haue by
triall sufficientlie prooued; I suppose it is euidentlie knowne vnto you, that either we must
of necessitie fight and stand at defense against the Englishmen, readie to assaile vs both with
open force and secret craft, either els iinke our selues with such alies and confederats, as
by their support we maie be the better able to withstand the malice of such vnfaithfull people.
Call ye this faith, or treason, I praie you ? The Saxons in times past being requested of the
Britains to aid them against their enimies, were most louinglie receiued, and highlie rewarded for their seruice : but they contrarilie in recompense of such kindnesse, shewed
themselues in steed of aiders, enimies ; in st&eacute;ed of defenders, destroiers: turning their
weapons points against the Britains, by whome they had b&eacute;ene so sent for to their aid; and
now haue not onelie destroied a great number of them by fire and swoord, but also they
haue spoiled them of their kingdome &amp; libertie. What league or truce haue they at anie
time kept (you your selues are not ignorant of this which I speake) where either they saw

occasion to vex their neighbors, or hoped to gaine anie thing by falsifieng their faiths, a
they that haue neuer b&eacute;ene ashamed so to doo, where hope to haue commodite (if I may
so call it) hath at anie hand b&eacute;ene offered. Into what sundrie and most miserable calamities
hath the trecherie of the Saxons brought the sillie Britains? How oftentimes haue they
broken the peace established with vs, and also with the Picts; euen when we least thought
vpon anie such thing ? Yea and that more is, amongst them selues at this season the Englishmen warre one against another, more with craftie traines than with open force, in such
wise that in Northumberland so manie kings, and so manie noble men haue b&eacute;ene traitorouslie
murthered and made awaie, that scarse may there be anie found that will take vpon him the
supreme gouernement of that countrie. It is not manie y&eacute;eres ago, since Oswin king of
<note place="marg">To induce others to his purpose, he taketh the aduantage of casuall haps, charging the whole nation with the fault of a few particular persons.</note>
that countrie was rid out of the waie through treason of Oswie that succeeded him in the
kingdome, and was after depriued both of life and kingdome by Osrike, whome Egbert desirous to reigne in his place, found meanes by traitorous practise to dispatch. Egbert was
slaine by Mollo, and Mollo by Alfred, which Alfred was after slaine by the guilefull craft
of Ethelbert. Neither had Ethelbert anie better successe in the end, for now of late betraied by his owne subiects, he was by them shamefullie slaine and murthered. Neither
with lesse traitorous shifts and deuises doo the Englishmen mainteine their warres in all
places where they are inhabiting within Albion. The reuerend fathers of the spiritualtie,
and other godlie men addicted to vertue, vnto whom the setting foorth of Gods woord
hath b&eacute;ene committed, wearie of and abhorring this wood madnesse, rage and wicked misdemeanor of that nation, haue left their bishoprikes, abbeies, monasteries, and cels, and from
thence haue remooued into forren regions. Therefore where the Englishmen doo absteine
at this present from making vs warres, it is not to be imputed to anie reuerence they haue
vnto faith, equitie, or respect of the league, which they haue made with vs, but onelie vnto
such ciuill sedition and discord, as now dooth reigne amongst them. Neither ought anie
of vs of right to doubt, but that when the same once ceasseth, they will immediatlic take
weapon in hand against vs, notwithstanding all leagues or couenants of peace confirmed to
the contrarie. To represse therefore and abate their subtill practises, I can find no readier
meane than to enter into friendship, and conclude a league with that people, which being
ioined with vs, may chastise such outragious furie of this wicked nation, as cause and oportunitie shall require. Fortune hath offred vnto vs a conuenient meane and occasion h&eacute;erevnto. For h&eacute;ere be at this present the French kings ambassadors, offering that vnto vs,
which (being so great a benefit) we might scarse wish for. That is, they require to haue
vs to ioine in league against the Englishmen, with their king, whome France, Spaine, and
<note place="marg">The Frenchmen in those daics possessed not onelie that part of Gallia, which we now call France, but also the most part of the countries now inhabited by the Dutchmen or Germans, namelie on this side the riuer Rhene.</note>
no small part of Germanie doo acknowledge for their souereigne. Ought this to be despised
of men that haue their perfect senses? Ought the societie of the French nation to be refused of vs, inhabiting here in the vttermost parts of the earth, the same being fr&eacute;elie offered
by them, vnto whom for their sincere faith both towards God and man, the large empire
of the world is granted ? So that if we shall thankfullie receiue this most notable benefit,
the same shall purchase vnto vs the friendship of the Spaniards, Frenchmen, Germans, and
all those nations which acknowledge king Charles for their head and souereigne lord. H&eacute;erevpon also fr&eacute;e passage for merchants shall be open, to passe to and fro vnto vs, with all kind
of merchandize and wares of traffike. I trust therefore that euerie one of you (so that he
weie the thing with himselfe throughlie) will easilie iudge that the friendship and societie of
the Frenchmen (verie puissant both by sea and land) and thereto of approoued faith and stedfastnesse in promise, ought more to be est&eacute;emed, and is more beneficiall to the Scotish commonwealth, than the vnstedfast promises and great disloialtie of the Saxons. To which of
you is it vnknowne that the English nation studieth no lesse to bring vs vnder the yoke
of seruitude, than they doo the Welshmen, if their force might answer directlie to their
wils ? Therefore if we desire to auoid the violent power of most cruell enimies, if we meane
to auoid their craftie practises, if we regard the christian religion, for the which the Frenchmen are continuallie in armor, if we set more by vertue and constancie than by

vnfaithfulnesse and breach of couenants and promises, if we labor for the glorie and honor of our
nation, if we couet to aduance our countrie, our owne rest, and quietnesse; and to be
briefe, if we passe vpon life and libertie, the most d&eacute;erest things that may happen to man,
let vs with ioifull harts establish this league with the Frenchmen, and firmelie continue in the
same, vpon assured trust and confidence that it shall bring perpetuall commoditie and renowme to vs, both for the safegard of our realme, &amp; restreint of the Englishmens vnlawfull
attempts and wrongfull iniuries, which h&eacute;ereafter they either shall or may at any time enterprise against vs." &para; By this oration Albian drew the multitude easilie vnto his purpose.</p>
<p>Then Achaius vnderstanding how the minds of all his subiects were in manner wholie
inclined to the league, commanded all the companie to be there in the same place againe
the next day. And so breaking vp their assemblie for that time, the king made the French
ambassadors that night a costlie supper with a banket, and after hauing conference with his
<note place="marg">The league with the Frenchmen agr&eacute;ed vpon.</note>
nobles and lords of the councell, it was agr&eacute;ed by generall consent amongst them, that for
the solemne ratifieng of this league with king Charles, according as he had required, there
should go with his ambassadors at their returne the lord William the brother of king Achaius,
with foure other honorable and learned personages, being men of perfect knowledge and
skill, and such as were est&eacute;emed most meet for such a purpose. Also, that they should take
foure thousand men ouer with them to serue against the infidels and enimies of the christian
religion, where and in such sort as king Charles should appoint them.</p>
<p>H&eacute;erevpon the next day going first to church, and there making their common 
<note place="marg">The league is concluded.</note>
supplications vnto almightie God, according to the rites and ancient customes, they after resorted
vnto the councell chamber, where Achaius opened and declared vnto the French ambassadors
all that was concluded by him, and other the estates of his realme, touching the message
which they had brought from king Charles. Who reioising (as should app&eacute;ere) greatlie
h&eacute;ereat, gaue most hartie thanks vnto him, and to all the residue for their beneuolent wils
h&eacute;erein shewed towards king Charles their maister, and all the French nation. After this,
remaining certeine daies with Achaius, who made them all the ch&eacute;ere that might be imagined,
they departed towards Hungus king of the Picts, vnto whome at their comming to his 
<note place="marg">Hungus king of the Picts.</note>
presence they made the like request on their maisters behalfe, which they had made before vnto
Achaius.</p>
<p>It is said that Hungus gaue the Frenchmen most hartie thanks for their good wils, but
<note place="marg">Hungus refuseth to conclude anie league with the Frenchmen.</note>

<note place="marg">The French ambassadors returne home.</note>
yet he would not grant to conclude anie league with them at that time, for that (as he alledged) the matter being weightie and of great importance, required no small time to deliberate and take aduise for a full resolution therein. The ambassadors h&eacute;erevpon returned
vnto Achaius without sp&eacute;ed of their purpose with Hungus, and the second moneth after, all
things being readie for their returne, and the passage of those that should go with them, the
lord William the kings brother, togither with the same ambassadors, &amp; such foure persons
<note place="marg">Claudius, Clement, Iohn Maesbell, Raban, Alcuine.</note>
as the king had chosen foorth amongst all the learned clergie of his realme (whose names
were Clement, lohn, Raban, and Alcuine) and also hauing with him those foure thousand
men of war, which were at the first appointed to go with him, passed foorth towards France,
where he with all the whole companie landed within few daies after in safetie, according to
their owne wished desires. At their comming into France Charles the emperor receiued
<note place="marg">The Scotishmen are honorablie receiued of Carolus the French king.</note>
them in most gladsome wise, dooing them all the honor that might be deuised, and the
souldiers which were come to serue him vnder the leading of the foresaid William, he reteined in wages, vsing them after the same sort and rate as he did his owne naturall people
the Frenchmen.</p>
<p>Shortlie after also at the request of the Scotish orators, according to the charter signed by
<note place="marg">The league is published by heralds.</note>
Achaius, and confirmed by consent of king Charles, the league betwixt the Frenchmen and
S&ccedil;ots was solemnelie published by heralds at armes, according to the maner in those daies
vsed, the same to indure betwixt those two nations and their posterities for euer. The
chiefest articles comprised in this league were as followeth. [The amitie and confederation
<note place="marg">The articles of the league.</note>
betwixt the Frenchmen and Scots to be perpetuall and firme, to indure betwixt them and

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"the"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"190"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

the posterities of both nations for euer. The iniuries and warres which the Englishmen
should attempt against either nation, should be accounted as common to them both. The
Frenchmen being assailed by warres of the Englishmen, the Scots should send their aid of
souldiers, hauing their charges borne by the Frenchmen as well for furniture, as wages, and
all other things necessarie. The Frenchmen should contrariwise aid the Scots in time of
wars against the Englishmen at their owne proper costs and charges. Whatsoeuer he were,
priuat person or publike of these two confederat nations, that against either of them should
aid the Englishmen with armour, counsell, vittels, or in anie other maner of wise; the same
should be reputed for a traitor vnto both their princes and countries. Neither might either
of them conclude a peace, or take anie truce without the consent of the other. These were
the principall articles of the league, as then confirmed betwixt the Scots and Frenchmen, indited in Latine, and faire ingrossed in parchment, and reserued as a monument in both
realmes, for a witnesse vnto such as should come after of this friendship thus begun, as the
Scotish chronicles affirme.] And for further memorie of the thing, Achaius did augment
<note place="marg">The armes of Scotland.</note>
his armes, being a red lion in a field of gold, with a double trace seamed with floure delices,
signifieng thereby, that the lion from thence foorth should be defended by the aid of the
Frenchmen; &amp; that the Scotish kings should valiantlie fight in defense of their countrie,
liberties, religion, and innocencie, which are represented by the lilles, or floure delices, as
heralds doo interpret it. The lord William, the said Clement, and Iohn, remained still with
king Charles, but Rabane &amp; Alcuine returned into their countrie. In all such warres and
iournies as Charles afterwards made against anie of his enimies, the said lord William was a
<note place="marg">The valiantnes of William.</note>
chiefe dooer in the same, so that his fame and authoritie dailie grew in all places where he
came. His seruice stood king Charles in notable stead in his expeditions against the Saxons,
Hungarians, and other; but namelie his estimation in Italie was most highlie aduanced, at
what time the said Charles reedified the citie of Florence, appointing this William to be his
<note place="marg">Florence is reedified.</note>

<note place="marg">William lieutenant of Tuscane.</note>
lieutenant in Tuscan, and to haue the chiefe charge for the restoring of the said citie, which
he with such diligence applied, that within short time the same was not onelie fortified with
new wals, repared and replenished with great numbers of houses, churches, and other beautifull buildings, but also peopled and furnished with citizens, a great companie of nobles and
gentlemen being called thither out of euerie citie and towne thereabouts for that purpose.</p>
<p>The citie being thus restored to hir former estate and dignitie, through the bounteous
benefit of king Charles, and the diligent administration of his lieutenant the foresaid William,
the citizens to shew themselues thankefull, deuised for a perpetuall memorie to beare in their
armes a red lillie, resembling one of those which the kings of France giue, saue that it differed
<note place="marg">The armes of Florence.</note>
in colour, to testifie thereby, that their citie (after the destruction therof by the Goths) was
reedified and restored to the former dignitie, by the benefit of the Frenchmen. And to acknowledge the diligence herein of the lieutenant, they did institute publike plaies to be vsed
and celebrated euerie y&eacute;ere, wherein with manie pompous ceremonies they crowne a lion.
<note place="marg">Allon crowned.</note>

or institution. Before the accomplishment of these things, by the foresaid lord William,
brother (as is said) to the Scotish king Achaius, I find that the vniuersities of Paris and
<note place="marg">The vniuersitie of Paris and Pauia.</note>
Pauia were instituted by king Charles, chiefelie by the helpe and means of these two foreremembred Scotishmen, Iohn and Clement, insomuch that Clement was appointed chiefe
president of all the students at Paris, and Iohn of the other at Pauia.</p>
<p>But now to returne to the other dooings of Achaius, ye shall vnderstand, that about the
<note place="marg">Adelstane entereth into Deira.</note>
same time, or not much differing from the same, Adelstane the sonne of Ethelwoolfe king of
Westsaxons, taking vpon him the dominion of Kent, Eastsaxon, Mercia, and Northumberland (which Egbert his grandfather had receiued into his gouernement) desirous now to
inlarge his kingdome, entred into that part of the Pictish dominion, which ancientlie hight
Deira, and conteined the marches about Berwike, alledging how the same apperteined to
his kingdome of Northumberland, and had b&eacute;ene fraudulentlie taken from his ancestors by
the Picts: but forsomuch as there was a commotion raised the same time in Mercia, he was
called backe to appease it, and herevpon putting all to the fire and sword in Deira, sauing
<note place="marg">Deira wasted by fire and sword.</note>
such prisoners as he brought away with him, he returned. Hungus the Pictish king sore
stomaching this iniurious enterprise of the Englishmen, determined to reuenge the same in
all possible hast, and therefore made instant sute vnto Achaius (who had maried his sister)
<note place="marg">Hungus aided with Scotishmen inuadeth Northumberland.</note>
to haue his aid against them.</p>
<p>Achaius of his owne accord minding to doo the Englishmen a displeasure, sent foorthwith vnto Hungus to the number of ten thousand men. With which, and with his owne
power, king Hungus inuaded the borders of Northumberland, fetching from thence a great
bootie of goods and prisoners; but yet he forbare slaughter of men, and burning of houses,
<note place="marg">He warred without slaughter and burning.</note>

<note place="marg">Athelstane pursueth Hungus.</note>
for a reuerence which he had, as is supposed, towards the christian religion. Athelstane
being certified hereof, omitting his iournie into Mercia, turned all his power against the
Picts: and hearing that they were withdrawen into their countrie, he followed them so
n&eacute;ere at the h&eacute;eles, that verie earlie in one morning he was vpon their backs where they
lodged by a brooke side, not passing two miles from Haddington, before they had anie
knowledge of his approch. Athelstane vpon a fierce courage, hauing thus found his enimies
according to his wished desire, and herewith comming vpon them in such order of battell,
as they had no waie foorth to escape without fight, he commanded a proclamation to be
<note place="marg">Athelstane his cruell proclamation.</note>
made by one of his heralds, that all the whole number of the Picts should passe by the edge
of the sword.</p>
<p>The Picts thus s&eacute;eing their enimies at hand, and hearing this cruell commandement, were
<note place="marg">The Picts are amazed.</note>
woonderfullie amazed with the strangenesse of the thing, and oppressed so with feare, that
they wist not what might be best for them to doo. At length by commandement of Hungus
their king, they fell vnto fortifieng of their campe; but yet they quicklie perceiued how that
<note place="marg">The Picts enter the campe.</note>
it would not long preuaile them, considering that their enimies had gotten into their hands
not onelie the spoile which they had brought with them out of Northumberland, but also all
other their prouision, trusse, and baggage, which they had left in a field there adioining
vnto the side of their campe. Herevpon manie reasons were put foorth amougest them,
which way they might escape out of that present danger. In which meane time Athelstane
<note place="marg">Athelstane dooth chalenge his enimies.</note>
hauing brought his people into good order of battell, prouoked the Picts to come foorth of
their strength into the plaine field, there to trie their forces. But for that day no notable
thing was doone; the Picts k&eacute;eping themselues still within their campe.</p>
<p>In the night following, after sundrie consultations had amongest them, it was agr&eacute;ed
by generall consent, that the next day they should giue battell to the Englishmen. And
so herevpon preparing themselues for the purpose, euen vpon the breake of the day, 
<note place="marg">The Picts prepare themselues vnto battell.</note>
forward they make towards their enimies with fierce willes, speciallie incouraged thereto by
the comfortable words of Hungus. The Englishmen halfe amazed at the hardie approch
and onset of the Picts, were not long able to susteine their sore impression; so that beginning somewhat to swarue, at length they were forced to fl&eacute;e vnto the place, where ye heard
<note place="marg">The Englishmen are put to flight.</note>
how they tooke the baggage and spoile of the Pictish campe: where they were beaten

downe in greater numbers than before, insomuch that such prisoners as they had before
taken of them that kept the said spoile, greatlie now to aduance the victorie of their fellowes, shewed more crueltie towards the Englishmen than anie of the rest, now that they
saw once how the victorie was inclined to the Pictish side.</p>
<p>In fine, such slaughter was made, that of the whole English host which was there assembled, there vnneth escaped flue hundred. Athelstane himselfe at the first was run through
<note place="marg">Athelstane is slaine.</note>
the bodie with a speare, and so died, giuing name to the place of the battell, which continueth euen vnto this daie, being called Athelstans foord. This victorie fell to the Picts by
<note place="marg">Ailstone foord.</note>

<note place="marg">A dreame.</note>
miracle: for in the night season, as Hungus was laid downe to sl&eacute;epe (after it was agreed
that they should giue battell) there appeared vnto him the apostle saint Andrew (as the tale
goeth) promising him and his people victorie against their enimies on the day next following;
and for an assured token thereof, he told him that there should appeare ouer the Pictish
host in the element such a fashioned crosse, as he sometime suffered vpon. Hungus
<note place="marg">The crosse of saint Andrew.</note>
awakened, and beholding the skie, saw the crosse, as the apostle had told him: wherevpon
calling his people togither, he not onelie shewed them the same sight, but also declared vnto
them what vision had appeared vi to him in his sl&eacute;epe; willing them therefore to be of good
comfort, sith there was cause of such assured hope to haue assistance from aboue against
their cruell enimies.</p>
<p>The signe of the foresaid crosse was not onelie s&eacute;ene of the Picts and Scots being there
<note place="marg">Saint Andrew the Scotishmens patrone.</note>
with them in aid, to both their great comforts and gladnesse, but also of the Englishmen to
their no lesse discouragement, as they that vnderstood saint Andrew to be patrone and protector of the Scotish and Pictish nations. For it did put such a feare into their hearts, that
when they came to the point of ioining, their stomachs so failed them, that with small resistance they were easilie vanquished (as is said) and put to flight. For this so manifest
a miracle, after the battell was once ended, and the victorie obteined, Hungus repaired with
his people following him, vnto the church of that blessed man saint Regulus, now called
<note place="marg">Saint Reule.</note>
saint Andrewes, where they made their offerings with humble deuotion vnto the relickes of
the apostle, rendering thanks vnto him for their victorie with deuout praier after the accustomed maner. They vowed there also at the verie same time (as the fame goeth) that
from thencefoorth as well they as their posteritie in time of war should weare a crosse of
<note place="marg">Why Scotishmen vse saint Andrews crosse in warfare.</note>
saint Andrew for their badge and cognisance. Which ordinance continuallie after remained
with the Picts, and after their destruction and extermination with the Scots euen vnto our
time. The bodie of Athelstane was buried in the next church vnto the place where the
<note place="marg">Athelstan his buriall.</note>
field was fought, howbeit, some haue left in writing that his head was cut off from the bodie,
and brought to Inchgaruie, where being set vpon a stake, it was shewed to the people in
reproch of his iniurious enterprise.</p>
<p>Hungus the Pictish king to shew himselfe yet more mindfull of the due honoring of the
holie apostle, by whose aid he acknowledged himselfe to haue got the victorie aforesaid,
not onelie augmented his church with new bildings &amp; n&eacute;edfull reparations, but increased
<note place="marg">Hungus repareth saint Andrews church.</note>
the number of priests for the celebrating of diuine seruice; he also gaue manie rich and
costlie ornaments vnto the same, as chalices, cruets, basons, &amp; such like. Moreouer, he
caused to be made the images of Christ and his 12 apostles of fine gold and siluer, which
<note place="marg">Images of gold and siluer.</note>
he bestowed there; with a case also of beaten gold, therein to inclose the relickes of saint
Andrew. And besides this, he ordeined that the spiritualtie should haue the tenths of all
<note place="marg">Tenths to be giuen to the cleargie.</note>
increase of goods: as of corne, cattels, herbage, and such like through his realme: and
further that spirituall persons should not be compelled to answere before anie temporall

<note place="marg">And why not.</note>

Feredeth that was the fourth, which reigned amongest the Picts after Hungus, tooke from them
all such gifts as this Hungus had giuen them, and further ordeined to the derogation of
their priuileges, that they should answere for secular crimes afore secular magistrats; and
that liuing vpon their former reuenues, souldiers &amp; men of war should inioy the other which
Hungus had so fr&eacute;elie bestowed vpon them.</p>

<p>The nobles of the land mainteined Feredeth in his dooings, reckoning all that spirituall
persons had to be but cast away, which was the cause (as some thought) that their kingdome
came into such ruine, as shortlie after followed. There be some chronicles that write how
these things, which are mentioned of Hungus, and Athelstane, chanced not altogither about
this season, but Hector Boetius followeth Veremond in most of his accounts, as the author
whom he taketh to be most certeine, as well for the account of the time as in the course of
the whole historie. And for that we meane not to presume wholie to derogat the same
Boetius his credit, we haue not much dissented from him, but rather followed him in most
places, leauing such doubts as may be woorthilie put foorth of that which he writeth, vnto
the consideration of the diligent reader, sith it is not our purpose to impugne, but rather
to report what we find written by others, except now and then by the way to admonish the
reader of some vnlikeliehoods (as the same dooth s&eacute;eme to vs and others) and happilie not
without iust occasion.</p>
<p>But now to our purpose. As well Hungus king of Picts, as Achaius king of Scots, after
the ouerthrow and death of Athelstane, liued with their people in good quiet and rest: for the
Englishmen attempted nothing against the Scots and Picts afterwards, during the time of their
reignes. At length Achaius, after he had reigned 32 yeares, departed this life, in the yeare of
<note place="marg">Achaius departeth out of this life.</note>

our Lord 819, which was about the sixt yeare of Hungus his dominion ouer the Picts. His
bodie was buried in Colmekill, according to the maner of kings amongest his predecessors.
In the daies this of Achaius (beside Clement and others, of whome before ye haue heard) liued

crowne and dignitie, desirous of nothing more than to s&eacute;e the aduancement of the house of
Achaius. Such (saith he) were the merits of that famous prince towards the preseruation of
the Scotish common wealth, that it were too much wickednesse to go about to defraud his issue
of the inheritance of the realme.</p>
<p>Alpine giuing the king most hartie thanks, besought him to continue in the administration,
<note place="marg">Alpine his excuse vnto Dongall.</note>
drawing God and the world to witnesse, that he minded nothing lesse than to be about to
claime the gouernement of the kingdome so long as he liued. For as touching his offense, in
that he had gathered an armie, and led the same into Argile, it was not his fault, but the conspirators which had forced him thereto, being determined to haue slaine him, if he had not
consented vnto their desires. Within thr&eacute;e yeares after, there came messengers from the 
<note place="marg">Dongall maketh an armie against the rebels.</note>
rebels to excuse themselues also, &amp; to put all the fault in Alpine: but king Dongall giuing small
credit to their forged words, gathereth his power, and maketh such sp&eacute;ed towards the place
where he vnderstood the said rebels were assembled togither, that he was vpon them yer
they had anie knowledge of his setting forwards. So that before they could make anie shift
to escape out of danger, which they went about to doo, they were apprehended, and immediatlie condemned and put to death. Which execution put other presumptuous persons in
feare, so that the state of the realme remained afterward a great deale more in quier.</p>
<p>Whilest things passed thus in Scotland, Eganus the second sonne of Hungus the Pictish
<note place="marg">Eganus murdereth his brother.</note>
king, found means to murder his brother Dorstolorgus, to the end he might reigne in his
place: and through support of some of the nobilitie he atteined to his purpose. And for
that he would assure himselfe the more firmelie in the estate, he frankelie bestowed his fathers treasure amongest his lords and chiefest p&eacute;ers of his realme, and tooke to wife Brenna
the king of Mercia his daughter, whom his brother the forenamed Dorstolorgus had maried,
that thereby he might asswage the said king of Mercia his displeasure, which otherwise he
should happilie haue conceiued for the death of his other sonne in law the same Dorstolorgus. His feare was great on ech side, and therefore had small affiance in anie person,
<note place="marg">Eganus liueth in feare.</note>
doubting lest one or other should s&eacute;eke to reuenge his brothers death. He durst neuer go
anie waies foorth abroad without a gard of men of warre about him, whome he had woone &amp;
made his fast friends by his passing great largesse and bountifull liberalitie. At length yet,
his wife to reuenge hir former husbands death, found means to strangle him as he lay one
<note place="marg">Eganus is strangled of his qu&eacute;ene.</note>
night fast asl&eacute;epe, hauing droonke a little too much in the euening before, and in this sort
he came to his end, after he had reigned much what about the space of two yeares.</p>
<p>Thus both Eganus &amp; Dorstolorgus being made away, without leauing anie issue behind
them, forsomuch as now there remained none of the posteritie of Hungus to succ&eacute;ed in gouernement of the Pictish kingdome, Alpine nephue to the said Hungus, by his sister Fergusiana, with the aduise of king Dongall, made claime therevnto, and thervpon sent his 
<note place="marg">An ambassador sent vnto the Picts.</note>
messengers vnto the lords and peeres of the Pictish dominion, to require them on his behalfe, that he
might be receiued to the gouernement of the kingdome due vnto him by lawfull inheritance,
as they well vnderstood: and that if they throughlie considered of the thing, they might perceiue it was the prouision of almightie God, that for want of lawfull succession lineallie descended from Hungus, now to succ&eacute;ed in the estate of the Pictish kingdome, by this meanes
both the nations Scots and Picts should be ioined in one, to the abolishing of all such mortall warres, as by discord and contention might arise betwixt those two people, in like sort as
before time there had done, to the great perill and danger of both their vtter ruines.</p>
<p>The Pictish nobilitie, hauing knowledge that these messengers with such kind of message
<note place="marg">The Picts chose Feredeth to be king.</note>
should shortlie come from Alpine, with generall consent and whole agreement, chose one
Feredeth to be their king, a man of great authoritie amongst them, supposing this to be a meane
to defeat Alpines title, and that thereby he should s&eacute;eme to be excluded from any further
claime. Within few daies after, came vnto Camelon the Scotish ambassadors, where Feredeth
<note place="marg">The ambassadors come into the court.</note>
with his nobles at that present were assembled: they being admitted therefore to declare their
message, when they began to enter into their matter of the right which Alpine had to the
kingdome of the Picts, the people would not suffer them to proceed anie further therein, but

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"began"</fw>-->

<pb n="195"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"195"</fw>-->

began to make such an vprore, that to appease the noise, Feredeth himselfe tooke vpon him
to make answer vnto the ambassadors: and thervpon commanding silence, declared vnto
them that the Picts neither might nor ought to admit any stranger to reigne ouer them: for
<note place="marg">King Feredeth his answer vnto the Scotish ambassadors.</note>
there was an ancient law among them, of most high authoritie, that in case of necessitie they
might transpose the crowne from house to house: and further, that by the same law there
was an ordenance decr&eacute;ed, that if anie man were once made and created king, he might not
be deposed during his naturall life. And therfore though it were so, that Alpine were the
nephue of Hungus by his sister Fergusiana: yet bicause he was a stranger borne, and considering withall, that the people by their full authoritie had translated the regall administration
vnto an other house, of the which one was alreadie proclamed and inuested king, there was no
reason now, why Alpine should make anie further claime or demand vnto the kingdome.</p>
<p>Vpon the messengers returne home with this answer, Dongall shewed himselfe to be in no
<note place="marg">Dongall his displeasure with the Picts answer.</note>

<note place="marg">Ambassadors sent againe.</note>
small chafe, that the Picts should thus go about by such subtill arguments and contriued inuentions to defraud Alpine of his right. And therevpon the second time he sent his ambassadors vnto them, requiring them either to doo him reason without anie further surmised cauillations; either else within thr&eacute;e moneths space after to looke for open warres at the Scotishmens
hands. These ambassadors passing foorth on their iourneie, at their approching vnto 
<note place="marg">Ambassadors are not receiued.</note>
Camelon, certeine sergeants at armes met them, and did forbid them to enter the citie: also
they further commanded them in name of Feredeth their king to auoid out of the confines of
his dominions within foure daies space, vpon paine of death.</p>
<p>The ambassadors being terrefied with such maner of inhibitions, they went no further:
<note place="marg">Warre is pronounced vnto the Picts.</note>
but yet according as they had in commission, they pronounced the warre in the name of Alpine and Dongall, requiring those that thus came to m&eacute;et them, to giue signification therof
vnto their maister Feredeth, and to the whole Pictish nation; and so returned home the same
way they came. Then did the Scotish lords repaire vnto Dongall, who at the same time laie
in Carrike castell, and there taking counsell for the maintenance of these warres, not one was
found amongest them which offered not to spend both life, lands, &amp; goods in Alpines iust
quarell. By this means was great preparation made on both sides for the warre, the Scots
<note place="marg">The Scots willingly giue themselues vnto the war.</note>
minding to set Alpine in his right, and the Picts determining not to receiue any prince of a
strange nation to reigne ouer them. But whilest Dongall goeth about to prouide all things
readie for his enterprise, he chanced to be drowned in the riuer of Speie, as he was about to
passe the same in a bote. This mishap chanced him in the sixt y&eacute;ere of his reigne, and after
the birth of our Sauiour 830. His bodie was buried in Colmekill, with all funerall obsequies.</p>

from the place of the battell. In the morning there were certeine horssemen appointed to
ride abroad, and to view the field, thereby to vnderstand whether the Picts ment anie deceit
by their departure, as by laieng of some ambushments, or otherwise: but vpon the returne
of those horssemen, when it was once knowne how there was no such matter, but that they
were fled in deed, the Scots reioising thereat, fell to and gathered the spoile of the field,
<note place="marg">The Scots diuide the spoile.</note>
diuiding the same amongst themselues according to their accustomed order.</p>
<p>Alpine himselfe commanded the bodie of his enimie Feredeth to be laid in christian 
<note place="marg">Feredeth is buried.</note>
buriall not farre from Forfair. After this causing the musters of his people to be taken, he
found that he had lost the third part of his armie in that mortall and cruell battell, and therevpon brake vp his campe for that time, licencing those that were left aliue to returne vnto
their homes. This battell being fought in the first y&eacute;ere of the reignes of the two foresaid
<note place="marg">The Scots determine to warre onlie with ineursions.</note>
kings, weakned the forces of both nations, so farre forth that the Scots doubting to bring
the realme into danger of vtter ruine (if they should commit their whole puissance eftsoones
to the hazard of another foughten field) determined to pursue the warre by making of incursions and inrodes onelie vpon their enimies, so to vex the Picts, and to bring them vnto reason,
if it were possible. And so much verely the Scotishmen did by such their continuall rodes
&amp; incursions which they made into Angus, that the countrie was left void and desolate of all
the inhabitants.</p>
<p>Neither did Brudus the sonne of Feredeth, (whome the Picts had chosen to succeed after
<note place="marg">Brudus succ&eacute;edeth his father Feredeth.</note>
his father in the kingdome) find anie sp&eacute;edie redresse to withstand those dailie inuasions
thus made by the Scots vpon his countries and subiects. For he was but a slouthfull person, and verie negligent in his office, wherevpon he was had in derision of his owne people, who in the end slue him amongst themselues before he had reigned fullie the terme of

<note place="marg">The king casting off his ariner fl&eacute;eth.</note>

<note place="marg">He was slaine by a plowman.</note>
one whole yeare. Then succ&eacute;eded Keneth, the second some of Feredeth, with no better hap
or end than his brother. For gathering togither an armie of his subiects, and comming with
them into Angus, he came no sooner within sight of his enimies, but that casting off his armor, he fled incontinentlie, leauing his people in the field; and for that his haste, was
slaine by a plowman that met him by chance, and knew him not, but yet perceiuing
how he had fled from his companie, and therefore deserued not to haue anie other fauour.
His people seeing themselues destitute of their head capteine and gouernor, retired from
their enimies, k&eacute;eping themselues in order of battell without anie further attempt.</p>
<p>After this infortunate end of Keneth, the Picts chose to their king one Brudus, a man of
<note place="marg">Brudus king of the Picts.</note>
a stout and manlike stomach, who immediatlie vpon his entring into the estate, comming
into Angus (which region the Scots had made waste) catched there certeine Scotish robbers,
and foorthwith hanged them vp vpon gibets. After this, he sent foorth his ambassadors

<note place="marg">Alpine refuseth anie treatie of peace.</note>
haue the ancient league renewed betwixt them. Alpine and the Scotish lords, hauing
quicklie aduised what to answer, declared vnto the Pictish ambassadors plainelie, that they
would not heare anie treatie for peace, till the Picts had deliuered the kingdome vnto the
right heire. Brudus vnderstanding by this answer, that the Scots would still follow the
warres against the Picts; to be the better able to withstand their malice, he purposed to
<note place="marg">Brudus sendeth an ambassador vnto Edwine king of England for aid, with a summe of monie.</note>
procure the friendship of the Englishmen, to haue their aid against the Scots. He sent
therefore his ambassadors with a great summe of monie vnto Edwine king of Northumberland, requiring him of his fauour, and to haue some number of his people for his wages to
serue him against the Scots.</p>
<p>Edwine receiuing the monie, promised to come himselfe with a mightie armie, at what
<note place="marg">The monie is receiued and aid promised.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots take Angus.</note>

<note place="marg">Brudus sendeth vnto Edwine for aid.</note>
time &amp; place Brudus should appoint, to go against the Scots in defense of him and his subiects the Picts. Manie of the Picts reioised greatlie, that they should haue aid thus of the
Englishmen, hoping thereby to haue assured victorie of their aduersaries. Other mistrusted
not a little the Englishmens offers, by reason of the old enimitie betwixt the Picts and them.
In this meane season the Scots take and seize vpon all the countrie of Angus, euen from
the mounteine of Granzebene vnto the riuer of Taie, whereof Brudus being certified,
sendeth a post with all sp&eacute;ed vnto king Edwine king of Northumberland, requiring him to
send to his aid a power of Englishmen, to helpe to resist the Scots, which at that present
inuaded his countrie. To which demand Edwine made this answer, that he was not onelie
<note place="marg">Edwine deferreth his aid.</note>
troubled with ciuill war made against him by other Englishmen, but also had b&eacute;ene requested by Lewes surnamed Pius, as then French king, in no wise to indamage the Scots his
confederats, so that for that yeere present he might not conuenientlie send to him anie succours, but if he would defer the warres till the next y&eacute;ere, he should haue the best helpe
that he were able to shew him.</p>
<p>Brudus perceiuing himselfe thus mocked and deluded by the Englishmen, commanded
<note place="marg">Brudus being deceiued of the Englishmen, called his owne subiects to the warre, assembling them at the foot of Calidon wood.</note>

the day and place appointed came togither, which being mustered, they streitwaies remooue
vnto Calidon castell, now called Dunkeld, where they passe the riuer of Taie, and so enter
into Angus, not without some difficultie: but being once gotten ouer, they march foorth.
with towards the place where they vnderstood their enimies did lie. Brudus the night before
the day in the which he thought they should haue battell, by the aduise of certeine expert
warriours, which he had with him, appointed all the horses that were in the campe, seruing
for burden, to be bestowed amongst the women, lackies, and coistrels, part of them being
<note place="marg">A woonderfull policie vsed by Brudus.</note>
clad in armor, and part in white linnen, with long poles in their hands like to speares and
iauelins. Amongst them also he ordeined an hundred horssemen to be placed, whome he
made priuie as then to his intention, by whose leading that feat which should be wrought
in this behalfe, was to be atchiued. These he caused to lie couertlie within a wood n&eacute;ere
vnto the place where the battell should be fought, giuing them in commandement not to
shew themselues till the battell were begun.</p>
<p>King Alpine all this while held himselfe in a castell which stood vpon an hill, a little from
<note place="marg">The incamping of Alpine his armie.</note>
Dund&eacute;e, being now decaied, so that little thereof remaineth to be s&eacute;ene at this day. Vpon
the north side of the hill, there lieth a great large plaine, compassed on ech side with mounteins, as then full of woods &amp; launds, but now for the most part bare and without anie
tr&eacute;es or bushes. In this plaine were the Scots incamped. Alpine beholding foorth of the
castell, how the Picts approched to giue battell, got him into the campe, &amp; exhorting his
people to shew themselues valiant, placed them in araie. The Picts no lesse desirous to
fight than their gouernors would haue wished them, began the battell before they had

commandement, with such violence, that the right wing of the Scots was sore disordered. But
Alpine perceiuing that, came sp&eacute;edilie to their succours, greatlie reproouing them for their

faintnesse of courage. To be short, he did so much to imbolden them, that by his means
the fight was renewed in most cruell wise: insomuch that those which before were put
backe, began to winne ground againe, and to beate downe their enimies verie fiercelie.</p>
<p>But heerewith did the counterfet troope of horssemen, which was hid in the wood suddenlie come foorth, and shewed themselues vpon the backe halfe of the Scotishmen, app&eacute;ering in sight to be an huge number, &amp; farre more than they were in d&eacute;ed: with which sight the
<note place="marg">The Scots being deceiued with a counterfet troope of horssemen fled.</note>
Scots being brought into a sudden feare, least they should be compassed about with multitude of enimies, they brake their arraie, threw off their armor, and tooke them to their f&eacute;et
so to escape and saue themselues by flight. Thus few were slaine in the battell, but a great
number died in the chase, &amp; were beaten downe on ech side as they were ouertaken by the
Picts. Alpine himselfe was taken, and hauing his hands bound behind him, was led to the
<note place="marg">King Alpine taken by his enimies and after beheaded.</note>
next towne, and there beheaded. The place beareth the name of him vnto this day, being
called Pasalpine. His head also was set vpon a pole, and borne vnto Camelon, and there
set vp vpon one of the highest turrets of the wall. The Scots that escaped from this sorowfull ouerthrow, got them with all sp&eacute;ed into Argile, where they inuested Kenneth the
<note place="marg">Kenneth the sonne of Alpine inuested king of Scotland.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>834.</date></note>
sonne of Alpine king of their realme. This was in the y&eacute;ere of our Lord 834, and the
fourth y&eacute;ere after Alpine entred first into the estate.</p>
<p>The Picts hauing atchiued this great and ioifull victorie, assembled at Camelon by commandement of their king, where causing a solemne procession to be made, in rendering
thanks to almightie God for their good successe in their passed iournie: they take a generall

<note place="marg">The good counsell of graue men is despised.</note>
oth vpon the gospell booke, that from thencefoorth they would not ceasse to make the
Scots war, till they had vtterlie destroied the race of them: and herewith ordeined a law,
that if anie man made mention of anie peace or league to be had with the Scots, he should
lose his head for it. There were indeed some ancient personages amongst them, that spake
against this insolent outrage of the people, alledging that in time of prosperous successe
men ought to vse a modestie: but certeine youthfull persons offended with such graue aduise, thrust the authors thereof out of the church, within the which they were as then assembled. The Scots being certified h&eacute;ereof, were nothing h&eacute;erewith discouraged, but rather put
<note place="marg">The Scots are animated.</note>
in good hope of better successe, sith the enimies abused themselues thus in time of felicitie.</p>
<p>The next summer after, the Picts assembled their power togither, and setting forward
<note place="marg">The Picts fall at variance within themselues.</note>
towards the Scots, thorough a light occasion they fell at variance amongst themselues, and
fought with such hatred togither, that the king was not able to appease the fraie, till night
parted them in sunder. Then calling the lords afore him, he assaied alwaies to haue agr&eacute;ed
the parties, but when he saw it would not be, in the morning he gaue them licence to depart euerie man to his owne home, breaking off his iouinie for that time. Brudus liued
not past three moneths after, for through griefe that things went not forward as he wished,
he fell into a gr&eacute;euous disease, and finallie thereof died. After whose deceasse, the Picts
<note place="marg">Brudus died.</note>

<note place="marg">Drusken K. ouer the Picts.</note>
chose his brother named Drusken, to succ&eacute;ed in gouernment of the kingdome, who applied
his whole indeuour vpon his first entring into the estate, to appease the ciuill discord
amongst his subiects.</p>
<p>But whilest he was thus busilie occupied about the same, there were certeine Scots, which
<note place="marg">The head of king Alpine is stolne, and solemnlie buried with the bodie.</note>
sore disdained to vnderstand that the head of their late king should remaine vnburied, in such
reprochfull sort amongst their enimies. Wherevpon hauing perfect knowledge of the
Pictish toong, they feined themselues to be merchantmen of that countrie, &amp; comming vnto
Camelon, watched their time, till they found meanes in the night season to steale to the
wals, and secretlie taking awaie the head, escaped with the same home into their owne
countrie.</p>
<p>This act of theirs was not a little commended; and so now the head of king Alpine being
recouered, was closed in a ledden coffin, and Kenneth himselfe, hauing in his companie a
great number of his nobles, went with it ouer into Colmekill, where he buried it in the
abbeie, amongst the sepultures of his elders, togither with the residue of the bodie in verie
solemne wise, as apperteined. And further, those persons that had put their liues in 

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"uenture"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"199"</fw>-->

aduenture to fetch the same head from the wals of Camelon, were by Kenneth rewarded with rich
gifts and lands in perpetuitie, to remaine to them and to their heires for euer. After this,
Kenneth deuising for the suertie of his subiects, furnished all the holds and castels on the
<note place="marg">Kenneth fortified the realme.</note>
frontiers of his enimies with men and munition, according as he thought expedient: and
moreouer tooke order, that all the youth of the realme should be in a readinesse vpon an
houres warning, to go foorth against the Picts, if they attempted anie new inuasions.</p>
<p>But the Scotish lords had no great lust to take anie enterprise in hand eftsoones against
the Picts, remembring how infortunatelie they had sped the last time: so that for the space
of thr&eacute;e y&eacute;eres there was no great exploit atchiued, saue certeine roads and incursions,
which both the nations continuallie vsed to make one vpon an other, as time and occasion
serued. At length king Kenneth being verie desirous to be reuenged of the Picts, for the
<note place="marg">Kenneth called his nobles to reuenge his fathers death.</note>
death of his father king Alpine, and other iniuries by them doone and attempted against the
Scotish nation, in the fourth y&eacute;ere of his reigne, he assembled the peeres and chiefest nobles
of his realme, trusting to persuade them to aid him in all such enterprises as he ment to take
in hand against the Picts, whome he purposed to pursue with open warres, till he had them
at his pleasure. But calling his lords and peeres thus assembled on a day before him, and
going earnestlie about to mooue them to the warres, he could stir them no more to his
purpose, than if he had beene in hand to haue counselled them vnto that which in no wise
had apperteined vnto their duties: which their lacke of stomach, Kenneth perceiuing, he
began to deuise a pretie shift, whereby to induce them to his accord.</p>
<p>First therefore, breaking vp the assemblie for the same day, he commanded that they should
<note place="marg">A pretie shift deuised by the king to persuade the nobilitie.</note>
come togither againe on the next morow, to consult further for the state of the realme, as they
should s&eacute;e cause. The same euening also he had them all to supper, which being prolonged
till farre in the night, it was late before they went to bed, so that being ouerwatched, when
they were once gotten to rest, they were soone brought into a sound sl&eacute;epe. Now had the
king appointed for euerie one of their chambers one man apparelled in garments pretilie deuised and made of fish skins vnskaled, bearing in one of their hands a staffe of such rotten
wood as shineth in the night, and in their other hand a great oxe horne, to the end that
vttering their woords through the same, the sound of their voices should s&eacute;eme farre differing from the vsuall sp&eacute;ech of man.</p>
<p>Thus appointed in the dead of the night, they enter the chambers to ech of them assigned,
where (as is said) the lords laie fast asl&eacute;epe, who being at the first as it were halfe awakened,
were woonderfullie amazed at the strangenesse of the sight (doubting whether it were but a
dreame, or some true and vnfeined vision.) H&eacute;erewith also were heard certeine seuerall voices,
<note place="marg">Of such sights there were manie in those daies: and oftentimes no doubt est&eacute;emed to be heauenlie visions ind&eacute;ed.</note>
far greater than those of men, declaring that they were messengers sent from almightie God
vnto the Scotish nobilitie, to command them to obeie their king, for his request was iust:
the Pictish kingdome due vnto him by rightfull heritage, &amp; ought to be recouered from that
people, which for their great offenses and sins towards almightie God, should shortlie come
to vtter destruction: such was the determinate pleasure of his diuine maiestie, against the
which might neither counsell nor puissance of man be able to resist.</p>
<p>When the counterfeited messengers had thus made an end of their woords, they slilie hid
their staues vnder their innermost garments, and therewith quicklie conueied their vppermost
vestures made of fish skales (as I haue said) into their bosoms, in such slight and nimble
wise, that it seemed these visions had suddenlie vanished awaie. Those lords that had s&eacute;ene
these sights, laie still for that night, greatlie musing on the matter. In the morning being
got vp, and assembled in the councell chamber, they declared to ech other what they had
seene and heard in the night passed. And for that all their visions which they had seene
by ech others report, were in euerie behalfe like, and nothing differing one from an other,
they bel&eacute;eued verelie it was some celestiall oracle &amp; message sent from God. Therefore
<note place="marg">The lords declare their vision vnto the king.</note>
presentlie they go vnto the king, declaring vnto him how they had b&eacute;ene admonished from
aboue, to continue the wars with all their forces against the Picts.</p>

<p>The king told them he had s&eacute;ene the like vision, but they ought to k&eacute;epe it close, least
<note place="marg">The answer of king Kenneth.</note>
by glorieng too much in the fauour shewed by almightie God toward them, they might
happilie displease his diuine maiestie, which otherwise they might perceiue was readie in their
aid. Then finallie might the vision be published, when thorough his fauourable assistance,
the warres were brought to a luckie end. This aduise of the king was well liked of them
all, and commandement giuen, that all maner of prouision should be prepared with all sp&eacute;ed
for an armie to be set foorth into Pictland. The lords going busilie about to prouide themselues of all things necessarie, mustered their men in all parts, so that there was leuied a
greater host than had b&eacute;ene seene in those parties of long time before. When the whole
power was come togither, Kenneth marched foorth with the same, entring by great violence
<note place="marg">Kenneth entred into Sterlingshire.</note>

<note place="marg">Drusken hastilie inuaded his enimies.</note>
into the Pictish borders about Sterling.</p>
<p>Drusken the king of Picts aduertised h&eacute;ereof, and hauing his armie in a readinesse both
of Picts and such Englishmen as he had reteined, to serue him for his wages, fetcheth a
compasse about, and passing by the Scotish armie in the night, incampeth betwixt them and
home, insomuch that the day did no sooner app&eacute;ere, but the one part desirous to be in hand
with the other, without token of trumpet, or commandement of capteine, they rushed togither most fiercelie. The hastie sp&eacute;ed of the Picts to ioine, put them to no small disaduantage; but the departure of the Englishmen, withdrawing themselues aside to the next
<note place="marg">The Englishmen fled.</note>
mounteine, most of all discouraged them: for the Scots therwith giuing a shout, declared
themselues to be highlie recomforted with that sight. Drusken in all haste sent vnto those
<note place="marg">Drusken sendeth to the Englishmen.</note>
Englishmen a messenger, willing them with large promises of reward to returne to his aid:
but the Englishmen answered, that their vse was not to fight without order and commandement
of their generall, and that the Picts like vnskilfull men had cast awaie themselues to be
slaine by the enimies hand, where it apperteined vnto warlike knowledge to auoid the
battell, when no hope of victorie appeered.</p>
<p>The middle ward of the Picts s&eacute;eing themselues left naked on the one side, and assailed
on the backs; whereas the Englishmen should haue kept their ground and defended them,
they began to shrinke: which the Scots perceiuing, stroke on the more fiercelie, till at
length the Picts not able to withstand their force, fell to running awaie. They made their
<note place="marg">The Picts are vanquished.</note>
course towards the water of Forth, which was not farre from the place of the battell, where
being ouertaken, they were beaten downe &amp; slaine in great numbers: for Kenneth gaue
commandement that they should spare none of the Picts nation, neither gentieman nor other,
that fell into their hands. The Englishmen whilest the Scots and Picts were thus occupied
<note place="marg">The Englishmen escape.</note>
in the fight and chase, withdrew homeward with all sp&eacute;ed; and by reason of the mounteins
which they had to passe, that tooke awaie the sight of them from the Scots, they escaped
into their countrie without anie pursute. Drusken himselfe so soone as he perceiued how
<note place="marg">Drusken escaped by flight.</note>
the field went against him, got him to his horsse, which he had appointed to be readie for him
at hand vpon all occasions, and so escaped out of danger with a few other in his companie.</p>
<p>The Scots returning from the chase, remained in the place of the battell all night, k&eacute;eping
strong watch about their campe, for doubt least the Englishmen had b&eacute;ene lodged in some
secret place n&eacute;ere by to haue set vpon them at vnwares, if they might haue s&eacute;ene anie aduantage; but in the morning when it was knowne how they were quite gone their waies,
and returned into their countrie (as before ye haue heard) then was the spoile of the field
and Pictish campe gathered and bestowed amongst the souldiers, after the ancient custome
of that nation. And then were they all licenced to depart eueie man to his home, with
thanks for their seruice and paines in this iournie so manfullie imploied. Within few daies
after, the Pictish king Drusken sent his ambassadors vnto king Kenneth to sue for peace.
<note place="marg">The Picts sue for peace.</note>
Kenneth was contented to heare him, and promised to grant a peace, so they would surrender into his hands the gouernement of their kingdome due vnto him by right of inheritance. But this condition being vtterlie refused of the Picts, was the cause that the warre
was eftsoones renewed with more crueltie than before.</p>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"201"</fw>-->

<p>The y&eacute;ere next insuing this battell, Kenneth got Mernes, Angus, and Fife into his hands,
<note place="marg">Kenneth getteth Mernes, Augus, and Fife.</note>
furnishing all the castels and holds with men, munition, and vittels. But whilest he went
about to subdue the countries about Sterling, woord was brought him that such as he left
thus in garison in those countries, were betraied by the inhabitants, and slaine euerie mothers sonne. Kenneth woonderfullie kindled in wrath for the newes, left off his treatie,
which then he had in hand with the people of Menteth and Sterlingshire for their submission, and returned in great hast towards Fife, where being arriued, he put all to the fire
<note place="marg">Fife is put to the fire and swoord.</note>

<note place="marg">Mernes and Augus is cruellie punished.</note>
and swoord, not leauing one aliue of the Pictish nation within all those quarters. The like
crueltie was shewed through the whole countries of Mernes and Angus, for an example to
other to beware how they falsified their faiths once giuen by waie of allegiance.</p>
<p>In the meane time that Kenneth with his Scots raged in such wise through those 
<note place="marg">Drusken commeth to rescue his people.</note>
countries, Drusken assembling all the power of his countries, came foorth into the field to m&eacute;et
the Scots, meaning either to put them backe out of the confines of his dominion, either else
to die with honor in the attempt thereof. Thus passing through the countrie, at length he
came vnto Scone, where afterwards stood a famous abbie of chanons of saint Augustines
order, and here he found Kenneth with his armie alreadie incamped. The next day, when
both parties were redie to haue giuen battell, Drusken wishing rather to aske peace whilest
his power was yet in safetie, than after he were once vanquished (if such were his misaduenture) to intreat for the same in vaine, sent an herald at armes vnto Kenneth, willing that he
might talke with him before he ioined, for that he had to say certeine things, which being
followed, might turne to the great benefit and commoditie of both the Scotish and Pictish
nations.</p>
<p>Kenneth for that he would not seeme to refuse anie indifferent offers, was contented to
come to a communication, and so therevpon both the kings in presence of both their armies
arranged in the field readie to fight, came togither in a place appointed, either of them
being accompanied with a like number of their nobles, as by the heralds it was accorded.
Here Drusken with manie reasons going about to persuade peace, shewed how necessarie
<note place="marg">The persuasion of peace by Drusken.</note>
the same was betwixt the two nations: and againe, how doubtfull fortune was to them that
trusted too much in hir vnstedast fauour: at length he grew to this end, that if Kenneth
could be contented to grant a peace, the Picts should release all such right, title and interest
<note place="marg">Mernes, Angus, and Fife is required of the Picts to release.</note>
as they had in the countries of Mernes, Angus, and Fife, vnto him and his successors the
Scotish kings for euer, so that he should make no further claime vnto anie other of those
countries which the Picts as yet possessed.</p>
<p>Herevnto Kenneth answered, that he well vnderstood how vnstable fortunes lawes were,
<note place="marg">Kenneth his answere.</note>
but sithens the Picts fought in an vniust quarell, as to defraud the posteritie of their lawfull
king Hungus, who latelie reigned amongest them, of the rightfull inheritance of their kingdome, they themselues had just cause to doubt fortunes chance, where the Scots hauing put
vpon lawfull armour, and s&eacute;eking to atteine that by warre which by other means they could
not atteine at the hands of the vniust possessors, they had lesse cause to mistrust hir fauour,
&amp; therefore if the Picts were desirous of peace, they ought to cause a surrender to be made
of their kingdome into his hands, accordinglie as they well knew it was reason they should.
And what commoditie might thereof insue to both nations, being by such means once
ioined and vnited into one intire kingdome, he doubted not but they vnderstood it sufficientlie
inough. And as for other conditions of peace than this, he told them plainelie there would be
none accepted. Thus did the kings depart in sunder, without anie agr&eacute;ement concluded:
and being returned to their armies, they make readie to trie the matter by dint of sword.</p>
<p>Kenneth exhorted his people that day to shew themselues men, sith the same should iudge
whether the Scots should rule and gouerne the Picts, or the Picts the Scots. With these
and manie other effectuall words when he had incouraged his folks to the battell, he diuided
<note place="marg">The order of the battell.</note>
them into thr&eacute;e wards, as two wings and a maine battell. In euerie of them he set first
archers and arcubalisters; and next vnto them pikes and speares, then bilmen and other
with such short weapons: last of all, an other multitude with all kind of weapons, as was

thought most expedient. The fore ward was committed to the leading of one Bar, a man
right skilfull in all warlike knowledge, the second one Dongall gouerned, and the third was led
by Donald the kings brother. The king himselfe with a troope of horssemen followed
them to succour in all places where he saw n&eacute;ed.</p>
<p>Then commanded he his trumpets to sound to the battell, which the Scots began with
such a ch&eacute;erefull shout, that the Picts euen vpon the first onset were so amazed, that if
Drusken had not with comfortable words relieued their fainting stomachs, the most part of
<note place="marg">King Drusken imboldeneth his people the Picts.</note>
them had fled without anie stroke stricken. But being incouraged through the presence of
their king, shewing himselfe with ch&eacute;erefull countenance amongst them, and therewith exhorting them to stand by him at that present, there was fought a right sore and cruell battell
betw&eacute;ene them. The women that were amongest the Picts, of whom there was no small
<note place="marg">The women were a cumbrance to the Picts.</note>
number, speciallie in the right wing, made such a wofull noise, when they beheld the men
one kill an other, that they were a more cumbrance to the Picts, than aid, when it came to
the point of seruice: by reason whereof that wing was shortlie beaten downe, and put to
flight. Which when Kenneth beheld, he set in with his horssemen on the backs of the
<note place="marg">Kenneth with the horssemen disordered the Picts araie.</note>

<note place="marg">The right wing of the Picts is put to flight.</note>
Picts, now left bare by the running thus away of those in the foresaid wing: and so entring
in amongest them, disordred their araie in such wise, that by no means they were able to
aid themselues, or come into anie order againe: so that in the end they were faine to throw
downe their weapons, and take them to their f&eacute;ete, thereby to escape the danger. Such
heaps of slaine men, armour, &amp; weapons laie here &amp; there strewed in the place of the battell,
that the Scots were forced in following the chase to breake their araie, so to passe the more
speedilie: by means whereof, falling amongest whole bands of the Picts, manie of them
were slaine.</p>
<p>This mischiefe Kenneth perceiuing, commandeth to sound the retreat, and so gathering
<note place="marg">Kenneth causeth the retreat to be sounded.</note>
his people about their standards, he appointed certeine companies in warlike order to pursue
in chase of the enimies, whilest he himselfe with the residue abode still in the place (where
the field was fought) all that day and the next night following. The Scotish capteins that
were sent to follow the chase, earnestlie executing their kings commandement, made great
slaughter of Picts in all places where they might ouertake them. Drusken the Pictish king
<note place="marg">The king of the Picts slaine.</note>
himselfe being pursued to the riuer of Taie, for that he could not passe the same, was there
slaine with the whole retinue which he had about him. It is said, that the Scotishmen incountred with the Picts that day at seuen sundrie times, and in seuen sundrie places, and still
the victorie abode with the Scots. The day after the battell such as had followed the chase
returned to the campe; where they presented vnto Kenneth their king, the armour and other
spoile of Drusken the Pictish K. which they brought with them, besides great abundance of
other pillage and riches, which they had gotten of the enimies that were slaine. Druskens
armour and other things belonging to his owne bodie, was offered vp to saint Colme, in the
church dedicated to his name within the Ile of Colmekill, there to remaine as a monument of
this victorie to such as should come after.</p>
<p>After this the whole preie and spoile was gathered and diuided amongest the souldiers.
Kenneth was counselled to haue discharged his armie, and to haue departed home; but he
purposing now to make an end of the whole warres, sith he was in such a forwardnesse,
called togither the multitude, and in this wise began to vtter vnto them his mind and purpose. "&para; It is the dutie of a good capteine, when he hath the victorie in his hands, &amp; as

if anie man shall thinke it best to suffer the enimie to remaine in quiet, after he be once
weakened and brought to a low ebbe, till time peraduenture he shall haue recouered his
forces againe, he shall procure to himselfe (as I gesse) more danger than happilie he is well
ware of. And that we may speake somewhat of this danger now present, the state of the
Pictish kingdome (as ye know) is sore inf&eacute;ebled, their power being diminished by force of

warre, is brought to that point, that it resteth in our hands vtterlie to destroie and exterminat
the whole nation. Which act ought to be abhorred, if it were possible for vs by anie meanes
to draw them (our honor saued) vnto our friendship. But the Picts are of such a stubborne
nature, and so desirous of reuenge, that so long as there remaineth anie one of them aliue,
they will beare in their hearts a desire to reuenge all such losses as they haue in anie wise susteined by this warre. Wherevpon I doo verelie belieue, that there is none of the Pictish nation from hencefoorth, will beare anie faithfull friendship towards the Scots. Therefore sith
we can not make the Picts, thus latelie scourged by vs, our friends, I thinke it best (except we
will neglect our owne safeties) vtterlie to destroie the whole nation, by putting to the
sword not onelie both men and women, but also all their youth and yoong children: least they
being descended of that linage, hereafter in time to come, arme themselues to the reuenge
of their parents deaths, and that not without perill of the vtter losse of our countrie and
kingdome."</p>
<p>This sentence of the king, though it s&eacute;emed too cruell to many, yet whether for that they
<note place="marg">The commos allow the kings saieng.</note>

<note place="marg">A cruell act committed by the Scots vpon the Picts.</note>
saw the same to stand with the kings pleasure, or that they thought it most expedient for the
suertie of the Scotish common-wealth, it was allowed and ratified by them all. Such crueltie
herevpon was foorthwith shewed throughout all the Pictish regions, that there was not one liuing creature of humane shape left aliue, sauing such as saued themselues within the walles of
Camelon, or in certeine other holds and fortresses, and also about two thousand of those that
fled into England: for all the residue were most vnmercifullie murthered and slaine, without
respect either of age, sex, profession, or estate. Thus Kenneth hauing dispatched the 
<note place="marg">Pictland parted vnto diuers men.</note>
inhabitants, seized the countrie into his owne hands, making partition of the same as he saw cause,
and diuiding it amongst his nobles, according to the merits of euerie of them dulie weied and
considered, he added new names vnto euerie quarter and region (either after the name of the
gouernor, or else of some promontorie, riuer, or other notable water or place, according as
was the ancient custome of the nation) that the memorie of the Pictish names might end togither with the inhabitants.</p>
<p>The countrie ancientlie called Horestia, was giuen vnto two brethren, Angusian, and 
<note place="marg">New names are giuen vnto euerie region.</note>

<note place="marg">Angus.</note>

<note place="marg">Merne.</note>

<note place="marg">Fife.</note>
Mernan, by reason whereof the one part of the same countrie was called Angus, and the other
the Mernes. The linage of those two noble men remaine vnto this day. The region which
till then was named Otholinia, was turned afterwards to the name of Fife, after the name of one
Fife Duffe : whose valiancie was throughlie tried in these last warres with the Picts. There
remaine vnto this day tokens and old ruines of a castell situate betwixt the riuer of Leuin
and saint Kenneths church, which (as yet appeareth) was fensed about with seuen rampires,
and as manie ditches, wherein the posteritie of this woorthie man after his deceasse had their
habitation by the space of of manie hundred y&eacute;eres. Louthian reteined still the former name,
<note place="marg">Louthian.</note>
so honorable was the remembrance of that famous prince king Loth amongst all men. The
<note place="marg">A reward giuen vnto Bar which was the fortresse of Dunbar.</note>
strongest castell of the whole countrie, Kenneth bestowed vpon that valiant capteine named
Bar, whose counsell and forward seruice stood the Scots in no small steed in those warres, in
which the Picts were thus subdued. That fortresse euer sithence (after his name) hath
b&eacute;ene called Dunbar, that is to say, the castell of Bar.</p>
<p>There descended of him a noble house or familie, bearing the name of this castell, 
<note place="marg">The familie of Dunbar.</note>
continuing in great fame and honor, euen vnto our time, of the which the earles of March had
their beginning, and continued long in that dignitie from one to another, with sundry
branches of right famous memorie. The names of diuerse dales were also changed, but yet

other countries, townes, and castels had their names changed at the same time, after they came
into the possession of the Scotishmen, vpon sundrie considerations, for a witnesse of their victorious acts atchiued against the Picts. Furthermore, into the citie of Camelon were

to be in safetie in the same, as well by reason of strength of the place, as also of the strong
garison which was appointed to defend it.</p>
<p>Kenneth therefore hauing taken his pleasure abroad in the countrie, came thither with a
<note place="marg">Kenneth sendeth vnto Camelon, c&omacr;manding them for to y&eacute;eld.</note>
mightie armie to besiege the citie. And first sending vnto them within, to know if they would
y&eacute;eld, he was answered, how sith it plainelie appeared, that the Scots could be satisfied with
nothing but with the slaughter of all such as fell into their hands, aswell of women and children, with impotent aged, as of others, they were minded neuer to surrender their hold with
life. Wherevpon the siege continued by the space of manie daies. Whilest the Scots in the
meane time got togither a great number of fagots, and other such brush and stuffe to fill the
ditches withall, which were verie d&eacute;epe and broad, at length when they within began to want 
<note place="marg">They of Camelon require truce for thr&eacute;e daies.</note>
vittels, they required a truce for thr&eacute;e daies, in the which meane time they might take aduise for the
surrender of the citie. Kenneth mistrutsing no deceit, granted their request, and therevpon
commanded his people to ceasse from all maner of annoiance of the enimies, for that terme.</p>
<p>But in the meane time the Picts prepared themselues of all things necessarie to make an issue
<note place="marg">The Picts issue vpon the Scots with great fortune.</note>
vpon the Scots. There was also an old gate forlet and stopped vp with earth and stones vpon
the one side of the citie, so that of a long time before there had b&eacute;ene no way foorth by the
same. Wherefore in the darke of the night the Picts ridding away the earth and ramell wherewith it was closed vp, about the third watch they passe foorth at that gate in good order of
battell, setting first vpon such Scots as kept the standing watch, who were in doubt of nothing lesse than of anie issue to be made on that side, by means whereof they were easilie oppressed, and likewise the other that kept the inner watch, insomuch that the slaughter went
on almost euen to the kings tent with great noise and clamor, as is commonlie seene in such
sudden tumults, especiallie chancing in the night season.</p>
<p>When the day began once to appeare, the Picts withdrawing towards the citie by the same
waie they came, were pursued by the Scots, and no small number of them slaine at the entring. The citie also had beene taken at the same time, but that the Picts out of the turrets
and loupes of the walles, discharged a woonderfull number of quarels, darts, arrowes, stones,
and other things vpon the Scots, as they approched n&eacute;ere to the gate, where their fellowes
(that made the issue) hasted to enter againe into the towne. There were slaine of the Scots
at this bickering aboue six hundred, wherewith Kenneth was so kindled with wrath, that 
<note place="marg">An extreame vow made by king Kenneth.</note>
detesting the falshood of the Picts, he vowed by open oth that h&eacute;e would not depart from the
siege, till he had put the citie and them within to fire and sword, without spa ng of anie,
either one or other.</p>
<p>Sundrie times he attempted to haue woone the citie by force of assault, but the Picts still
<note place="marg">The constancie of the Picts when they were besieged.</note>
defended their walles so stoutlie, that he could not atchiue his purpose. Wherevpon the
siege continued for the space of foure moneths togither. So that such scarsitie of all kinds of
vittels still arose amongst them, that the wretched citizens absteined from nothing that might
in anie wise be eaten, though it were neuer so much to be abhorred. And yet although they
were brought into such miserable state, that there was no hope longer to defend themselues, if anie man notwithstanding all such extremitie, were heard make mention of surrendering, he was foorthwith slaine by his fellowes, as an enimie to his nation and a friend vnto the
Scots. It was thought that Kenneths oth made them so obstinate in their wilfull contumacie,
bicause they saw nothing but death, which way soeuer they inclined.</p>
<p>At length when the citie was thus reduced into all extreme miserie, and the ditches filled
<note place="marg">A pretie craft vsed by Kenneth.</note>
with faggots and other such stuffe, Kenneth one night appointed six hundred of his choisest
souldiers to lie in ambush within a wood, ioining n&eacute;ere to one side of the citie, so that in the
morning when he should giue the assault on the contrarie side, they might suddenlie come
foorth and scale the walles on that other. These souldiers, according to that which they had
in commandement, shortly after the breake of day, hearing that Kenneth had begun the assault
on his part, quicklie came foorth of the wood, and hauing their ladders readie, came to the
walles, reared them vp, and swiftlie getting into the citie, opened one of the gates where one part
<note place="marg">The Scots enter the citie.</note>
of the armie entered ; the citizens standing in no doubt at all of anie attempt on that side : so as

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"being"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"205"</fw>-->

being gotten togither to defend the walles on that part where Kenneth gaue the approch, and
now hearing how the enimies were got into the citie, and comming on their backs, they
were woonderfullie amazed, but yet so long as they were able to make anie resistance, they
did what lay in their vttermost power to beat backe the Scots, and to driue them out of the
citie againe.</p>
<p>The slaughter therfore was great which the Scots made of the Picts in euerie passage &amp;
<note place="marg">The Picts are miserablie slaine, without regard of person.</note>
corner of the str&eacute;ets, insomuch that the Scotish lords and other capteins, in reuenge of the late
receiued losse of their men, through the false practised policie of the Picts, commanded in a
great furie to set fire on the houses, and to kill and slea all such of the Pictish nation as came
in their way. Thus the murther proceeded vpon all estates, aswell religious as other, and likewise vpon women and children, without anie difference. A number of ladies and 
<note place="marg">Ladies and gentlewomen desire the king to be pardoned of their liues.</note>
gentlewomen, getting them into the presence of king Kenneth, besought him in most lamentable wise,
to haue pitie vpon their wofull estate, and to saue their liues from the hands of his most cruell
souldiers. But such was the rage kindled in the Scotishmens hearts, that there was no
more fauor shewed toward them than toward the other, and so immediatlie were they also
slaine without all compassion. So farre foorth was the murther executed on all hands, that there
was not one left aliue of the Pictish nation, neither man, woman, nor child to bewaile that 
<note place="marg">All the Pictish nation destroied.</note>

<note place="marg">The citie of Camelon is throwne downe.</note>
miserable destruction of their countrie and kinsfolkes. Then were the walles throwne downe
&amp; made euen with the plaine ground. The houses and buildings aswell priuate as publike,
with churches and chappels, were set on fire, and that which might not be consumed with the
rage of fire was ruinated and destroied with hand, so that there remained of all that famous
citie, nothing but the ashes, with heapes of the broken and burned stones, and likewise
of the pauement and foundation of some part of the walles.</p>
<p>At the same time the castell of Maidens, now called commonlie Edenbourgh castell, was
<note place="marg">The castell of Maidens is left of the Picts.</note>
still kept with a mightie garrison of Picts, but they hearing of the miserable destruction of Camelon, and doubting to fall into the like mischance, left the castell void, and fled to Northumberland. Thus ended the kingdome of the Picts in Albion, in the y&eacute;ere after they first began
to reigne therein 1173, and in the y&eacute;ere after the birth of our Sauior 839, from the first

comming of Ferguse 1166, and after the creation of the world 4806, if the Scotish chronicles
be true. &para; But whereas the truth concerning the time of the first comming into this Ile, aswell of the Scots as Picts resteth doubtfull, and that aswell by authoritie of approoued writers,
as by reasonable coniectures, we haue in the historie of England more largelie written thereof; we referre those that be desirous to see further of that matter, vnto the same, following
here in this historie of Scotland the report most an end, as we find it in Hector Boetius, and
other the Scotish writers, not taking vpon vs so frankelie to set downe our owne opinion in this
Scotish, as in the English historie, through want of such helpes in the one, as we haue got in
the other.</p>
<p>There were s&eacute;ene the same yeere two comets or blasing starres of dreadfull aspect to the
<note place="marg">Prodigious tokens s&eacute;ene in the aire.</note>
beholders, the one went before the sunne rising in haruest season, and the other followed the
going downe thereof in the spring of the y&eacute;ere. There was oftentimes also s&eacute;ene in the aire
a vision of firie armies, running togither with burning staues, and the one being vanquished,
they suddenlie both of them vanished away. Also at Camelon, as the bishop was at seruice
holding his crosier staffe in his hand, it was kindled so with fire, that by no meane it could be
quenched, till it was burnt euen to ashes. About noone daie, the aire being faire and cleare,
as well in the countries of the Scots as of the Picts, there was heard such a noise and clattering of weapons and armor, with braieng of horses, as though two armies should haue b&eacute;ene togither in fight, whereby manie of either nation which heard it, were put in great feare. These

he placed it at Scone vpon a raised plot of ground there, bicause that the last battell
which he had with the Picts was fought neare vnto the same place, the victorie (as before is
specified) chancing to the Scots. Upon this stone (as before is rehearsed) the Scotish kings
were vsed to sit, when they receiued the inuesture of the kingdome. &para; Some writers haue

that there was no measure of offending and haunting of euill rule in all parties, insomuch
that shortlie, through want of all good gouernance, wrong was placed in st&eacute;ed of right, and
contempt of Gods honor imbraced euerie where in place of vertue and godlinesse.</p>
<p>In this meane while, the residue of the Picts remaining amongst the Englishmen, ceassed
<note place="marg">The exiled Picts require aid of the Englishmen.</note>
not to solicit the gouernors of the countrie to aid them towards the recouerie of their dominion out of the Scotishmens hands, promising to be subiects vnto the English nation, if by

<note place="marg">Osbert and Ella kings of Northumberland.</note>
of Northumberland were persuaded through instant sute to take that enterprise in hand, the
rather vpon trust of good successe, for that they vnderstood what lacke of politike gouernement then remained amongest the Scots, by reason of the kings naughtie demeanor and most
inordinat trade of life. But first there was a league concluded with new articles of 
<note place="marg">The Englishmen and Britains ioined their powers with the Picts.</note>

<note place="marg">An herald is sent vnto Donald.</note>
agr&eacute;ement betwixt the Englishmen and Britains, as yet inhabiting alongst the coasts of Cumberland, by meanes of which league both Britains and Englishmen ioined their powers togither,
and in most sp&eacute;edie and forcible wise passed the water of Tweed, first pitching their campe
in the countrie of Mers. From whence immediatlie king Osbert (being appointed as
generall in that iournie) sent an herald vnto Donald the Scotish king, commanding him
either to surrender vp vnto the Picts all such regions as the Scots had taken from them,
either else to looke to haue the Englishmen and Britains no lesse their enimies than the Picts,
whose cause they had taken vpon them to mainteine and defend.</p>
<p>Donald being at the first sore troubled with these newes, yet at length (by the aduise of
his nobles) he tooke a good hart vnto him, and in defense of his realme caused musters to
be taken throughout all his dominions, and foorthwith came into the field to incounter his
enimies, whome he found at Jedworth readie to giue battell: where after sore fight, in the
<note place="marg">Osbert is put to flight at Jedworth, or Jedburgh.</note>
end Osbert with his people was chased to the next mounteins. Donald hauing thus obteined
the victorie in this conflict, supposed all had b&eacute;ene his owne, and therevpon remooued ouer
Tweed with all possible hast, marching foorth till he came to the mouth of that riuer, where
there laie at anchor certeine English vessels, laden with prouision of vittels and all other
things necessarie for the furniture of an armie. Donald setting vpon these ships, with small
<note place="marg">Osbert his prouision by water is taken by the Scotishmen.</note>
resistance tooke them, spoiled them of all such things as were found aboord, and after set
fire on them. The spoile was diuided amongest the souldiers anu men of warre, which
serued them to small vse or commoditie : for all the youth of the armie, through example
of their prince, was so corrupted in vicious customes, that the campe was replenished with
hoores, bawds, stews, and dicing tables, in such wise, that all such prouision as should haue
serued for store and staple of vittels, was spent in riotous banketing without anie order or
measure: &amp; oftentimes (as it chanceth where politike gouernement lacketh) there happened
<note place="marg">A great disorder in the Scotish campe.</note>
amongest them in the armie, discord and variance with sundrie murders and slaughters.</p>
<p>When the enimies were aduertised how far out of order all things stood in the Scotish

togither againe, and before his approch was looked for of the Scots, he commeth vpon them
one morning in the breake of the day, and assaileth them in their lodgings, wherein he
found them so vnprouided of all helps to make resistance, that it was a woonder to s&eacute;e the
disorder that appeared amongest them: some of them running vpon their enimies naked
<note place="marg">The Scots campe suddenlie inuaded.</note>
without all discretion, other breaking foorth of the campe to saue themselues by flight, not
sparing hill nor dale where they saw anie way to escape the enimies hands, though it were
with present danger of breaking their necks downe the sideling banks and craggie rocks,
being forced thereto by the fierce pursute of the Englishmen and Britains, who most eagerlie
preased vpon them in all places, to reuenge the late receiued ouerthrow and slaughter of their
friends and kinsfolks. There died of the Scots in this mortall bickering aboue twentie
<note place="marg">20000 Scotishmen slaine.</note>

<note place="marg">King Donald is ken with the nobilitie.</note>
thousand persons. King Donald being fast asl&eacute;epe at the first assault of the enimies, as he

<p>The Scotish campe, the next day after this ouerthrow, was rifled, the spoile being diuided
<note place="marg">The campe is rifled.</note>
amongest the Englishmen and Britains. But when the fame of this infortunat battell was
noised once through the realme of Scotland, how the king was taken prisoner, his campe
<note place="marg">The whole realme of Scotland discomfited.</note>
woone, the armie discomfited, and almost all the souldiers and men of warre slaine, those
few of the nobles which were left aliue remaining prisoners in the enimies hands, there was
such dole and lamentation made ouer all, as though the realme had alreadie b&eacute;ene lost without recouerie. Some there were that blamed fortune, some curssed the wicked trade of life
in the king, other bewailing the great calamitie of this mischance put the fault in diuers
other things, as in such cases commonlie it falleth out: for in sundrie heads are euer sundrie opinions. Manie ran vp and downe the str&eacute;ets and high waies, to inqui&racute;e the certeintie
of all things, and whether there were anie hope at all left to resist the enimies, also which
way the enimies held, whereabout they went, and what they purposed to doo.</p>
<p>Anon after, when it was certeinlie knowen that the Englishmen were entred by Louthian,
<note place="marg">The Englishmen inuade Louthian, the Britains Galloway.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots left comfortlesse.</note>
and the Britains by Galloway, there was such feare mixed with sorrow (for losse of their
friends and kinsfolks) stricken into the peoples hearts, and namelie into the womens, that
a greater hath not b&eacute;ene heard of in anie region. So that all prouision to defend their
countrie was quite neglected, so amazed were the Scots with the sudden change of fortunes
fauor. The Englishmen herevpon tooke all the countrie euen to the water of Forth, and
likewise the Britains seized into their hands all that which lieth from the bounds of 
<note place="marg">The Britains as yet kept possession of Cumberland, and those other countries lieng by the coast of those west seas.</note>

<note place="marg">The victori&eacute; vsed cruellie.</note>
Cumberland vnto Sterling bridge, finding no resistance in their way at all. Herevnto aswell the
Englishmen as Britains vsed the victorie verie cruellie, sparing neither one nor other of
the Scotish bloud, that by anie means fell into their hands, but priests and all passed one
way, that is, by the edge of the sword.</p>
<p>King Osbert purposed to haue passed the water of Forth, that waie to haue entered into
Fife, &amp; so ouer Taie into Angus: but hearing that the Scots had gathered a power to impeach his passage, he staied certeine daies. At length vnderstanding that the enimies were
nothing of that puissance or number, as at the first they were reported to be; he determined to set ouer in certeine boats ten thousand of his men; but through a sudden tempes
<note place="marg">A great manie Englishmen drowned.</note>
of wind and weather, that rose in that instant, there were fiue thousand of them drowned,
the residue being constreined to land againe on the same side from the which they loosed,
hauing lost through violence of the weather all their tackle and whole furniture of their
vessels. Osbert being also admonished with this misfortune, thought good to attempt no
more the furious rage of the water, but determined by land to go vnto Sterling, where he
vnderstood he should find the Britains, with whome he might ioine his power, and passe
ouer the bridge there, and so inuade other of the Scotish regions which lay thereabout.</p>
<p>But at his comming thither, certeine Scotish ambassadours came vnto him to sue for peace,
<note place="marg">Ambassadors sue for peace.</note>
which they humblie required at his hands in name of the whole realme, beseeching him to
consider well the state of the case as it stood, and not to trust too much on brittle fortune,
<note place="marg">Fortune is brittle.</note>
the which sheweth hir selfe neuer stable; but commonlie vseth to call backe againe hir grant
of prosperous successe, where the receiuer hath not skill to vse it moderatlie, and the vanquished s&eacute;emeth to haue b&eacute;ene sufficientlie corrected. As for the Scots, though it might
appeare that their force was greatlie abated, &amp; that resistance should little auaile them: yet
were they minded to die in defense of their liberties, rather than to submit themselues vnto
anie conditions of vile seruitude. The words of these ambassadors being throughlie weied
(though some tooke them in great disdaine) yet in the end it was supposed that after
victorie thus had against the enimies, honorable conditions of peace ought to be preferred
before doubtfull warre.</p>
<p>Wherevpon answere was made to the ambassadors, that both the English and British
people with their kings were contented to haue peace with the Scots (though it laie in their
<note place="marg">Peace granted with conditions.</note>
hands now to destroy the whole nation) if so be the Scots would agr&eacute;e to resigne aswell to
the Englishmen as Britains all such lands and countries as they had now gotten into their

them or anie of their posteritie, so that the water of Forth on the east halfe, should
<note place="marg">The Forth called the Scotish sea.</note>
diuide the Scotish dominions from the confines of the Englishmen &amp; Britains, and be called
from that time euer after, the Scotish sea. On the west the water of Clide should diuide
the Scotish lands from the Britains; the castell of Alcluith, standing at the mouth of the
same riuer, to remaine in the hands of the Britains, from thencefoorth to beare the name of
Dunbreton, that is to say, the castell of the Britains. And furthermore, that if anie of the
<note place="marg">Donbreton.</note>

<note place="marg">It was called before Caer Arcluith, that is, the citie vpon Cluide, as <emph>H. Llhoid</emph> holdeth.</note>
Scots should attempt to passe the said bounds into anie of the British or English borders,
he should die for that offense. And if by force of tempest it chanced anie of them to be
driuen to land on the south shore, within anie of those parties, they s ould take nothing
away with them but water or vittels, and depart within thr&eacute;e daies, except some reasonable
cause of staie constreined them to the contrarie. Moreouer, they should not fortifie anie
townes or castels on the frontiers n&eacute;ere to the English or British confines. And further,
they should couenant to pay vnto the Englishmen and Britains, within the space of twentie
years, the summe of one thousand pounds of siluer. For performance of which articles
of agr&eacute;ement, the Scots should deliuer thr&eacute;escore hostages, being the sonnes and heirs 
<note place="marg">Hostages are required.</note>
apparant of the chefest noble men of all their realme and countrie. And if it so were that
they misliked and refused anie of these articles, he commanded that there should no other
ambassadour come to him for anie other treatie of accord.</p>
<p>The ambassadors returning home, and declaring how they had sped, manie of the Scots
<note place="marg">The Scots mislike the articles of peace.</note>
thought the articles nothing reasonable for fr&eacute;e people to accept; other indged that either
they must come to some agreement with the Englishmen and Britains, or els put the land
in extreme perill. Thus had the people b&eacute;ene diuided into two contrarie opinions and
factions, had not one Calene a noble man, borne of high parentage, and gouernour of
Angus, with sober reasons and strong arguments appeased this contention, persuading them
to haue respect to the time. And sith the force of the realme was so inf&eacute;ebled, abated,
<note place="marg">Calene his graue counsell taketh place.</note>
and brought vnder foot through aduerse fortune: better it was to yeeld vnto necessitie in
sauing part at that present, in hope after, when occasion serued to recouer the residue, than
through obstinat wilfulnesse to lose the whole. For considering the present danger, it could
be reputed no dishonor to receiue conditions of peace at the enimies hands, sith there wanted
not the like example of the Romans, who gladlie accepted such articles of peace, as that
noble prince king Gald appointed them: and yet it is not to be iudged, that there wanted
men of great knowledge and wisdome amongest them, and such as regarded their honor, so
far foorth as reason in anie wise did reach.</p>
<p>The multitude moued with these words of Calene, whose graue authoritie (by reason of
<note place="marg">The multitude consented vnto Calene his saiengs.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots receiue the peace.</note>
his age and roome) was of no small reputation amongst them, hauing lost nine of his owne
sonnes in the last battell, they finallie determined to follow his opinion in receiuing the same
conditions of agreement which Osbert had prescribed: and therevpon sent againe their ambassadours with the hostages appointed for the establishing of the peace, in maner as is before
rehearsed. Which being throughlie accomplished in such solemne wise, as in those daies
and in the like cases was accustomed, Osbert set Donald with his nobles at libertie, sending
<note place="marg">King Donald with the noble men are sent home againe.</note>
them home togither with the ambassadours, being earnestlie required so to doo, both by the
English lords, and also by the Britains.</p>
<p>The agr&eacute;ement being thus made, the lands were diuided betwixt the Englishmen and the
<note place="marg">Lands dluided betwixt the Britains and Englishmen.</note>
Britains, in such sort as the Britains had for their part all that which lieth from Sterling vnto
the west sea, betwixt the riuers of Forth and Clide, vnto Cumberland: and the Englishmen
possessed the other parcels, lieng from Sterling vnto the east sea, betwixt the Scotish sea
and Northumberland: so that by this means, Clide water, Forth, and the Scotish sea (where
Forth runneth into the maine sea) diuided the Scots from the Englishmen and Britains.
And thus was the towne of Sterling a common march vnto those thr&eacute;e people; the same
towne with the castell remaining vnto Osbert, as it was couenanted amongest other articles
of this peace. Here (as the Scotish writers haue) he ordeined his mint, and his coiners of
monie to inhabit, wherevpon came vp the name of Sterling monie: but therein they are

deceiued, for (as in the historie of England shall app&eacute;ere) that name came not in vse till
manie y&eacute;eres after. Osbert also in this place caused a stone bridge to be made ouer the
<note place="marg">A bridge of stone made at Sterling.</note>
water of Forth, in stead of the woodden bridge which the Picts had made there, and was
now pulied downe and in the midst of this new stone bridge he set vp a crosse, whereon
were ingrauen these verses, to be read of the passers by:

</p>
<p>The Picts which had b&eacute;ene with the Englishmen in this iournie, euer hoping to be 
<note place="marg">The Picts hope is deceiued.</note>
restored to their lands and former possessions by Osbert, when they saw how he reteined the
same in his owne hands, appointing his subiects to inhabit therein, they doubted that which
afterwards came to passe in d&eacute;ed, least the Englishmen of friends would now become enimies,
s&eacute;eking the destruction of the whole Pictish generation, thereby to assure themselues in the
possession of those lands and liuings, wherevnto the Picts (as they thought) would euer
make some claime and title, whilest anie of them remained aliue.</p>
<p>Vpon this mistrust therefore did those Picts, which were amongest the Englishmen, make
<note place="marg">The Picts went into Norwaie and Denmarke.</note>
the best shift they could for themselues, so that manie of them got ships, and sailed into
Norwaie and Denmarke, vnto their countriemen there: the other that could not make shift
to get away, were slaine anon after by the Englishmen, so that one of them was not to be
found aliue within anie of the English dominions. And such was the end of the Picts that
fled vnto the Englishmen for succour. In this meane time the Scotish king Donald being
restored againe to his countrie, was receiued with more ioy and honor than he had deserued;
in hope yet by this scourge of aduerse fortune, that he would haue reformed his former
abuses. Neuerthelesse, he had not b&eacute;ene at home anie long time, but that he fell to his

old vicious trade of life againe, remoouing from his companie such honorable personages as
wished the suertie of his estate, with the aduancement of the common welth, to the reliefe
and ease of his poore miserable subiects. At length the nobles of the realme, perceiuing
the danger that their countrie stood in, by reason of Donalds insolent misorder, vndiscr&eacute;et
rule and gouernement, they found means to apprehend and commit him vnto safe keeping.

Fishes likewise, in shape resembling the figure of man, were found dead in the sands of the
Scotish sea. In Galloway there fell such abundance of adders and snakes out of the skie,

decaied by the misgouernance of his said predecessor, that till the same were reformed, and
such intestine discord, as through licentious libertie reigned amongest his subiects might be
appeased and quieted, there was no hope to atchiue anie woorthie enterprise abrode against
forreigne enimies.</p>
<p>Herevpon by their aduertisements and good aduise, he deuised a reformation of all such
<note place="marg">Misorders are redressed.</note>
misorders as were growen vp in all parts of his realme: and first for the spiritualtie, he
ordeined that priests should attend their cures, and not to intermeddle with anie secular

businesse, but to be fr&eacute;e from going forth to the warres: neither should they keepe horsses,

<note place="marg">Youth should eate but one meale a day.</note>

<note place="marg">Drunkennes punished with death.</note>
apperteining to his vocation, he should for the first fault forfeit a p&eacute;ece of monie, but for the second
he should lose his benefice. For the youth of his realme he tooke order (to bridle them
the better from wanton delights and sensuall lusts) that none of them should haue past one
meale a day, and that of no fine or deintie delicats, and to absteine from all such drinke as
might distemper their braine, so that if anie yoong person, either man or woman, were
knowen to be drunken, they should die for it.</p>
<p>He commanded further, that all the youth of his realme, should exercise running, wrestling, shooting, throwing of the dart and bowle: so to auoid slouthfulnesse, that their bodies
might with such exercises be made the more able to indure paines and trauell: and for the
same purpose he tooke order, that they should lie vpon the bare boords, with one mantell
<note place="marg">Youth to be trained vp in hardnesse.</note>

<note place="marg">K&eacute;epers of banketting houses he banished.</note>

<note place="marg">Scots were made sober and able to abide hardnes.</note>
onelie throwen vnder them, so that they should tast nothing neither by day nor night, that
might noozell them in anie wanton delights or effeminat pleasures. It was also ordeined,
that all such as kept vittelling houses for banketting cheere, should be banished the realme,
with those that kept brothell houses. Thus were the Scots by obseruing of these ordinances,
made within short time of gluttons and excessiue f&eacute;eders, sober and temperat men: of delicat and easefull persons, hard, tough, and able to abide anie trauell or labor, were the
same neuer so painfull: and hereof the state of the common-wealth began to grow to good
perfection, so that Constantines administration was liked of the most part of all his subiects.</p>
<p>The first that went about to disquiet the prosperous reigne of that woorthie prince, was
one Euan, a man of an ancient house, &amp; borne in the westerne Iles. &para; Such haue b&eacute;ene
<note place="marg">Euan disquieted the king and realme.</note>

the vnquiet nature of the Scotishmen, euen from the beginning, neuer to liue contented anie
long time either with peace or warre: for being once wearied with the charges of the warres,
they streightwaies wish for peace; and hauing in time of peace heaped togither some wealth,
then can they not suffer the gouernement of their superiors, but either are readie to fall out
with some forreigne enimie, or else to raise some commotion amongest themselues. This
Euan therfore being the kings lieutenant of his castell of Dunstafage in Louchquhaber,
<note place="marg">Euan lieutenant of Dunstafage conspireth against the king.</note>
practised a conspiracie against the king, with a number of other light persons being gentlemen borne, misliking the administration of things, onelie for that they saw how their inordinar libertie to oppresse inferiour persons, and to vse such wild and insolent misdemeanour,
as they had doone afore time, was now restreined by lawfull iustice and execution of due
punishment for the same.</p>
<p>But as these conspirators went about to haue mooued the people of Louchquhaber, Murrey
land, Rosse, and Cathnesse, to haue ioined with them in their traitorous interprise; some of
them in whom Euan put most trust, secretlie aduertised the king of all the whole matter,

vpon them so at vnwares, he had the castell soone at his pleasure; and immediatlie herevpon
caused Euan to be trussed vp on a high paire of gallowes, for a spectacle to all his complices.
And furthermore, least the other conspirators might prouide them of some other chiefteine,
he apprehended diuerse of the nobilitie that were accused to be of Euans confederacie, the
which he put in streict prison, there to be safelie kept, till the peeres of the realme had

determined with good deliberation, what should become of them. This busines being in
this wise appeased, when all men looked for quietnesse, there suddenlie followed a greater
and more pernicious trouble: for such is the course of the world, that when men least thinke
<note place="marg">One trouble followeth another.</note>
of mischiefe, they fall oftentimes into most danger.</p>
<p>Cardane king of Denmarke, pretending a title to all such lands as somtimes belonged to
<note place="marg">Cardane king of Denmarke.</note>
the Picts, for that the residue of that nation which had escaped the hands of the Scots and
Englishmen, had resigned vnto him all their right &amp; interest of the same lands, he determined in that quarrell (and in reuenge of the iniuries which the Picts alledged they had
<note place="marg">The cause that made the Danes to make warre against England and Scotland.</note>
susteined) to make warres both vpon Scots and Englishmen. He caused therefore an huge
number of ships to be prepared, and a mightie armie of men to be put in a readinesse, to
passe in the same ouer into Albion, vnder the leading of his two brethren, the one named
Hungar, and the other Hubba. These two chiefteins hauing their ships and men with all
prouision apperteining once readie, tooke the sea, and sailed foorth till they came to the
<note place="marg">A great nauie sent into Scotland.</note>
coasts of Scotland, where they tooke land within the countrie of Fife, before anie tidings
were heard of their comming thither.</p>
<p>The Danes being set on land, spared no kind of crueltie that might be shewed against the
<note place="marg">The Danes vse great crueltie.</note>
inhabitants, and namelie for that they had not as yet receiued the faith of Christ, they raged
without all measure against priests, and religious persons, ouerthrowing and burning vp
churches and chappels, wheresoeuer they found anie in their way. Wherevpon the Englishmen that inhabited in Louthian, and the Scots that dwelled in Fife, left their houses &amp;
<note place="marg">The inhabitants fled the countrie.</note>
possessions, fl&eacute;eing into other parties, where they thought they might best escape the hands
of their new come aduersaries. A great companie also of such vertuous and godlie persons,
as about the same time laboured busilie in setting foorth the woord of life vnto the people in
those parties, fled with one Adrian as then bishop of the Scotishmen, into the Iland called
Maie, which lieth in maner in the midway of the passage ouer the Forth betwixt Fife and
Louthian, where as then there was a famous monasterie of moonks. But neither the reuerence of the place, neither the innocencie of those harmles creatures could restraine the
Danes from polluting their wicked hands in murthering that deuout companie, as they were

in memorie amongst writers, as the foresaid bishop Adrian, Glodian, Gaius, or (as others
write) Monanus archdeacon of saint Andrews, and bishop Stolbrand: the names of the residue are forgotten. &para; Some there be that affirme how this companie were Hungarians,

were Scots and Englishmen thus assembled there togither. But of whence soeuer they were,
certeine it is that by custome they were become Scots, and instructed the Scots (as before
is said) in the way of saluation. After this cruell slaughter thus by the Danes committed,
they continued in their wood rage, as they passed through Fife and the other countries n&eacute;ere
bordering vpon the same, till all the inhabitants were auoided out of their houses, either by
flight or slaughter.</p>
<p>Constantine the Scotish king being kindled in the meane time with passing great displeasure, for these so notable iniuries receiued at the hands of the Danes, thought good with all
sp&eacute;ed to go against them, and to attempt the chance of battell before they had wasted anie
further within his dominions, so greatlie to the diminishing of his roiall power and estimation amongst his subiects. Herevpon leuieng his people, and assembling a mightie host 
<note place="marg">Constantine assembled a mightie army.</note>
togither, he passed foorth with the same towards his enimies, the which were lodged in two
seuerall camps, the one being distant from the other about a quarter of a mile, seuered in
sunder with the course of a little riuer called Leuin, the which (vpon the approch of the
Scots vnto that part of the campe that laie on the further side next vnto them) chanced

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"to"</fw>-->

to be raised on such hight, thorough abundance of raine, that in two daies after vnneth it
might b&eacute;e passed ouer at the foords.</p>
<p>After this sore and tempestuous weather, the aire cleared vp and waxed verie faire and
calme, giuing occasion to the Scots to worke their feat against one part of their enimies,
whilest the other could not come ouer vnto their aid and succors. In this campe which lay
on that side the riuer next vnto the Scots, Hubba was lodged, who did what he could to
haue staied his men from issuing foorth of the campe, to giue battell when the Scots drew
n&eacute;ere to the same, and assaied all waies by prouoking the Danes with skirmishes to come
<note place="marg">The Scots &amp; Danes ioine their battels.</note>
foorth and fight with them in plaine field. But notwithstanding all that he could doo,
foorth they rushed in such wise by plumps, and with so great noise and clamour, that the
capteins were constreined of necessitie to set them in order of battell, sith they would n&eacute;eds
giue the onset vpon their present enimies.</p>
<p>The Danes did weare aloft vpon their armor certeine linen garments, wrought with red
<note place="marg">The Danes apparell.</note>

<note place="marg">Their weapons.</note>
silke, shewing faire and white both at hand and a far off. Their weapons were of such sort as
serued for the push rather than for downe-right blowes, the points being of such a handsome
strong fashion, that no armor might lightlie hold foorth against them. These kind of
weapons, togither with the muster of their huge bodies, was dreadfull at the first for the
<note place="marg">Tall men of bodie and lims.</note>

<note place="marg">A battell.</note>
Scotishmen to behold, as they marched towards them in araie of battell. But anon comming n&eacute;ere togither readie to ioine, the Scots manfullie taking to them new courages, set
vpon the Danes with great violence, who likewise began the battell verie stoutlie, so that the
same continued right fierce and cruell a good space. At length the Danes being assailed on
each side, both afront before, and on their backs behind, oppressed as it were with 
<note place="marg">The Danes take the flight.</note>
multitudes, did throw downe their weapons and fled amaine. Manie of them making towards
their campe were ouertaken and slaine, diuerse of them falling into the ditches were oppressed with throng, aswell of their owne companie, as of their enimies, as they passed ouer
them in following the chase, and striuing to enter the campe vpon such as stood to defend them
from entering. Other there were that leaping into the water in hope to get ouer, were
drownd in the whorling waues of the streame; though some, through helpe of their fellowes (which stood on the other side readie to haue passed the water, if they might so haue
doone without manifest danger of drowning) escaped and got ouer, amongst whome Hubba
<note place="marg">Hubba was saued from drowning</note>
was one, the great reioising of his brother Hungar, to s&eacute;e him thus deliuered twise from
perill of death, as first from amongest his enimies, and secondlie out of the roring streame
of that d&eacute;epe and swift raging riuer.</p>
<p>The Scots hauing thus put one part of their enimies to the woorse, with that happie 
<note place="marg">The Scots took of this victorie immoderate ioy.</note>
successe tooke such comfort and immoderate ioy, as though they had b&eacute;ene now sure of victorie
ouer all the residue; so that for two daies togither, there was such dansing, singing, and
piping amongst them, as the like hath not b&eacute;ene heard of. Yea so farre proc&eacute;eded their
insolent outrage, that they began to contend amongst themselues for the prisoners and spoiles,
<note place="marg">The Scots for ioy readie to fall out.</note>
which they counted now their owne, as though alreadie they had the same wholie in their
possession: and further reasoned, not without altercation, whether the Danish captens after
they had them once in their hands, should be put to death, or els be kept aliue to be shewed
to the people in triumph or no. Great adoo and manie vaine woords were spent h&eacute;ereabout,
in such earnest sort, that they were at point to haue fallen out amongst themselues: but
there was no mention at all made touching the ordering of their battels, and other the necessarie proc&eacute;edings against their enimies. At length, when the riuer was fallen and come
to his old course againe, so that it might easilie be passed, Constantine in order of battell
<note place="marg">Constantine proc&eacute;eded against his enimies.</note>

<note place="marg">The order &amp; placing of the Danes armie.</note>
got ouer with his people, to the other side where the Danes were lodged, who hauing more
mind to set themselues in such order, whereby they might gaine the victorie, than to deuise
for the diuiding of the spoile, perceiuing occasion now onered to giue the onset, foorthwith
araied their people in this sort.</p>
<p>Hubba with six thousand Danes, was placed in the right wing. The left was led by one
<note place="marg">Hubba had the right wing.</note>

<note place="marg">Buerne had the left wing.</note>
Buerne an Englishman borne, who was fled out of his countrie, for that he could not beare

<!--<fw place="top-left">"216"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

such iniuries as Osbert offered him in forcing his wife, to the great reproch and dishonor of
his house and name. He had with him in this left wing certeine bands of Englishmen, with
those Picts that had escaped ouer into Denmarke (as before is mentioned.) Hungar with all the
<note place="marg">Hungar kept the battell.</note>
residue of the armie, kept the battell or middle ward, exhorting his men to shew their force &amp;
manhood that day, sith the same should either put them in possession of the whole land of
Albion, with all the substance and riches conteined therein, either else bring them perpetuall
seruitude with ignominie amongst their most cruell and fierce aduersaries. He therefore himselfe openlie in presence of them all, vowed with solemne oth, either to returne with victorie
<note place="marg">Hungar made a vow.</note>
to his campe, either else to die in the place, willing them all to make the like couenant.
Wherevpon the vniuersall multitude allowed him so much for this his motion, that there was
<note place="marg">The souldiers did make the like vow.</note>

<note place="marg">King Constantine placed his men in like manner.</note>

<note place="marg">An incouragement giuen to his souldiers.</note>
not one amongst the whole number, which agr&eacute;ed not to sweare the like oth. Constantine
k&eacute;eping in manner the like order, placed in the right wing his brother Ethus, in the left Duncane the lieutenant or thane of Athole, appointing to either of them ten thousand men a p&eacute;ece.</p>
<p>All the residue were set in the battell where he himselfe stood. And first he gaue them
all hartie thanks in that they had so valiantlie atchiued the victorie in the last battell, requiring
them now not to blemish their former glorie with anie faintnesse of courage, recreant cowardise,
or dishonorable flight: and further he willed them in no wise to be afeard of their enimies, in
respect more for their hugenesse of bodie, than for anie of their valiant stoutnesse of heart:
for if they assailed them with one whole and entire consent, according to their woonted forwardnesse &amp; manlike prowes, they should quicklie put them to flight, and obteine a ioifull
victorie. Heerewith he also warned them not to run rashlie vpon the enimies, but to suffer
them first to giue the charge: for by that meanes he thought the Danes would with their
earnest violence disorder themselues, and so should it be more easie for the Scots to breake
in amongst them.</p>
<p>But this deuise did not a little abate the Scotish mens courages. For the Scots vse is,
when they shall enter into battell, to make a great shout and noise, and therewith to run vpon
their enimies, by which meanes (as they suppose) they both put the enimie in feare, and incourage themselues to the battell. The Danes at the sound of the trumpet marched foorth
<note place="marg">The Danes approch towards the Scots.</note>
towards the Scots, where they stood thus in order of battell: but when they perceiued that
the Scots came not forward, they also staied in the midway to refresh themselues, least at the
ioining they should be out of breath. Anon after, passing forward an easie pace, they shot
<note place="marg">The Danes shot quarels and threw darts.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots shot arrowes and darts as thicke as haile.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots are put to flight.</note>
quarrels, and threw darts at their enimies verie feshlie, and the Scots let flie at them againe
with arrowes and darts as thicke as it had b&eacute;ene a storme of haile.</p>
<p>After this they rushed togither with great violence on both sides: but within a while, the
Danes had put both the wings of their enimies to flight, and after compassing the maine battell round about, they constreine the same in the end with great bloudshed and slaughter to
giue backe and fl&eacute;e out of the field. Ten thousand Scots died that day in this infortunate
battell with Constantine himselfe, who being first taken was had into a caue by the sea side

<note place="marg">A long winter.</note>
melted, there was such a floud flowing ouer all the plaines euen to the roots of the mounteins, as
the like had not bene s&eacute;eme. Furthermore, when the same shrunke and went away, in the
mud and slime there was such a sort of frogs left, that when they were dead, and began to

<p>But to proc&eacute;ed. The Danes (as is said) hauing vanquished the Scots, and wasted the 
<note place="marg">The Danes went into Louthian.</note>
countrie of Fife, passed ouer into Louthian, where robbing and spoiling all before them, they pursued the inhabitants into Northumberland, whither they fled for refuge. There the Danes
being aided with certeine Englishmen in fauour of Bruerne, slue in battell both Osbert and
<note place="marg">King Osbert &amp; Ella slaine.</note>
Ella, kings of that countrie. The cruelde of the Danes was such after they had atchiued the
victorie, that few escaped with life, but such as saued themselues by flight. But chieflie
their rage appeared most against priests, and such as professed themselues men of religion.
For the Danes being Ethniks, persecuted most egerlie those that in anie wise professed Christ.
The like outragious murthering of the christians was practised throughout the countrie, and
<note place="marg">This crueltie inuaded Norfolke also.</note>
at length came vnto that blessed king saint Edmund, reigning as then ouer the people of the
Eastangles, as in the English historie more plainlie male app&eacute;ere. Howbeit other of the
English kings mainteined the warres with these Danes certeine y&eacute;eres after this, with variable
fortune; the most part of those people which inhabited on that coast toward the Germane
seas, either being slaine or brought into miserable bondage and thraldome. But Alured,
<note place="marg">King Alured redressed those harmes.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boetius</emph> mistaketh diuers matters touching the report of our histories.</note>

<note place="marg">Ethus surnamed Lightfoot.</note>
which succ&eacute;eded his brother king Edelfred, not in the kingdome of Northfolke and Suffolke
(as Hector Boetius affirmeth) but in the kingdome of the Westsaxons, redressed a great part
of this miserie, into the which the countrie was thus brought by the Danes, by subduing them
in sundrie conflicts, and sleaing their two capteins the foresaid Hungar and Hubba, as in the
same English historie is further expressed.</p>
<p>But now to returne vnto Ethus, I find that he was of such swiftnesse of foot, that he would
match and make waie in running with harts and hounds, and therevpon was surnamed Lightfoot: but of what nimble lightnesse of bodie soeuer he was, truth it is that he was of disposition in mind vnfit to haue the order of anie publike regiment. For whereas he might haue
<note place="marg">Ethus neglected the opportunitie.</note>
recouered Fife and Louthian with other regions, whilest the Englishmen and Danes were togither by the eares, he passed ouer that occasion, delighting more in following the pleasures
of the bodie &amp; sensuall lusts, than to bestow his time in feates of chiualrie and other warlike
exercises. The nobles of the realme perceiuing him thus to abuse the woorthie gifts of his

And least their resolution should be disclosed before it tooke effect, they slacked no time, but

Gregorie being thus established in the estate, considering that the suertie of all realmes rested
in the hands of the diuine maiestie, to begin his gouernment with some luckie enterprise,
caused a conuocation to be holden at Forfair, for the aduancement of Christs religion: where

amongst other things, it was ordeined, that priests from thencefoorth (to the end they might

of exactions. Also that they should not be constreined to go vnto the warres, neither to come

should be iudged in all causes. The same ordinaries and bishops should also haue authoritie
to order all men, both publike and priuate, aswell for the k&eacute;eping of faith giuen, as to constreine them to confirme the same, and to punish such as should be found in the contrarie;
likewise in causes of controuersie touching matrimonie, tithes, testaments, legacies, and such
like: moreouer the correcting of those that blaspheme either God or his saints.</p>
<p>Heretikes and necromancers, with other the like offendors against the lawes and articles of
the christian religion, was assigned vnto the bishops and their substituts, so that all those which
were found disobedient vnto them, and refused to be at their commandement, they should
haue authoritie to excommunicate them out of the church, and from companie k&eacute;eping with
anie of the c&omacr;gregation, so as they that were thus excommunicated, should be depriued of all
abilitie to inioy anie inheritance or right to lands or possessions whatsoeuer they were. Neither should they be accepted as a witnesse in anie maner of cause, neither beare anie office or

aduisednesse in all his woords, that he vttered few or none but that the same s&eacute;emed to be spoken
with verie great consideration. He was neuer maried, but continued in chastitie all his life
time. Of meate &amp; drinke he was verie spare, delighting in all kind of sobrietie, more watchfull than giuen to sl&eacute;epe. But his fame increased most for his mainteining of iustice and ciuill
administration concerning the state of the common-wealth, not omitting the practise of warre,
where necessitie required. The first expedition which he tooke in hand, he made into Fife, to
recouer that countrie to the crowne of Scotland. At whose entrance into the same, the Picts,
whome the Danes had left in those parties at their departure thence, being striken with feare
to fall into the hands of the Scots their ancient enimies, fled foorthwith into Louthian, leauing
Fife in manner void, and without anie that would offer to defend it against the Scots.</p>

with the Scots euen there, if they should come forward vpon them. But when they saw whatnumber the Scots were of, and h&eacute;erewith doubting the Englishmen to come on their backs if the
matter went not well with them; they thought it best that such Danes as were of anie great reputation of nobilitie, should withdraw into Berwike before the enimies were at hand, and the
residue to passe ouer Tw&eacute;ed into Northumberland, there to ioine with other Danes that in
<note place="marg">They fled into Northumberland.</note>

<note place="marg">The Danish nobilitie fled into Berwike.</note>
those parties were latelie arriued.</p>
<p>But the Englishmen within Berwike, abhorring nothing more than to be vnder subiection
of the Danes, in the euening after the receiuing of the Danish nobles into their towne, deliuered it togither with their ghests vnto the Scotishmen, who suffering the Englishmen at their
pleasure either to go their waies with all their goods, or to remaine still in their houses, slue
<note place="marg">The Danes are slaine in Berwike.</note>
the Danes, without sparing either man, woman, or child. Then leauing a strong garrison of
Scotishmen within Berwike, Gregorie marched foorth with the residue of his people into Northumberland, to vnite that countrie to other of his dominions that bordered vpon the same.</p>
<p>In those parties at that selfe time there were two armies lodged in the fields, the one of
Danes not far from Yorke, vnder the leading of one Herdunt, who had latelie taken and
sacked that citie, and the other of Englishmen that laie 20 miles off from the said Danes.
Herdunt hearing of the slaughter which the Scots had made of his countriemen at Berwike,
<note place="marg">Herdunt threatned the Scots.</note>
threatned sore that he would not leaue a man aliue of the Scotish race within anie part of the
confines of Albion. Which vow manie of the companie, following their capteins example,
likewise made. Shortlie after, hearing of their enimies approch, the whole host (by 
<note place="marg">The Danes prepare to the battell.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots egerlie inuade their enimies.</note>
commandement of Herdunt) issued foorth of their campe to giue battell.</p>
<p>H&eacute;ere the Scotish king standing with his people in order of battell, had thought to haue
vsed some comfortable speech vnto them, thereby to incourage them to fight: but such hast
was made by the Scots to preasse vpon their enimies, that he saw it more needfull to take h&eacute;ed
to the ordering of them in perfect araie, than to stand about to exhort them, whome he saw
readie inough of their owne accord to fight. Therefore he said no more vnto them, as he
<note place="marg">King Gregorie his saieng to the souldiers.</note>
went amongst the ranks, but onelie willed them to remember how cruellie Constantine their
king was sometime murthered, after he had y&eacute;elded himselfe prisoner to these enimies, with
whome they should now ioine.</p>
<p>The Scots h&eacute;erevpon running to the battell with no lesse stoutnesse of mind than violent
force, gaue their enimies scarse space to charge their weapons, but bare them downe with
long speares and iauelins, and withall the bilmen following them made great slaughter on ech
side, so that there n&eacute;eded neither exhortation of capteins, nor diligence of wiflers to keepe them
in araie. For the wrathfull stomachs of the souldiers onelie wrought the feat in such sort,
<note place="marg">The Danes fled to their campe.</note>
that the Danes were quicklie put to flight and chased. Those that could not escape to the
campe, got them vnto the next mounteins, who chanced vpon better lucke than those that
escaped to the campe, for the egernesse of the Scots was such in chasing the enimies, that neither ditch nor rampire could staie them from entring the campe vpon the Danes where they
made greater slaughter than they had doone in the field.</p>
<p>The next daie Herdunt goeth about to assemble his men togither againe, being dispersed here
<note place="marg">Herdunt assembled his men togither.</note>

<note place="marg">Herdunt went toward Rasin, chiefe generall of the Danes in England.</note>
and there; but when he vnderstood how he had lost the more halfe of his whole host he cursed
that vnhappie day, and determined to retire vnto Rasin, who as then was capteine generall of
all the Danes that were in England. But Herdunt by reason of his wounded men, whome he
was faine to carie with him, could not make forward with anie great speed, so that he was
scarse fortie miles got foorth on his waie, when woord came to him that Rasin fighting with
the Englishmen vnwarilie, at a place called Helcades, chanced to be slaine with a great multitude of his people: and therevnto his head was caried abroad vp and downe the countrie
from towne to towne to be s&eacute;ene. By such mishaps the prosperitie of the Danes so much
flourishing of late, began now manifestlie to decaie.</p>
<p>Herdunt although he was not a little discouraged therewith, yet he chose foorth a plot
<note place="marg">Herdunt remained in campe.</note>
of ground most meet for his purpose, where he determined to abide in campe, till he might
vnderstand what the Danes in other places were minded to doo. But Gregorie king of Scots,

hauing thus expelled the Danes foorth of Northumberland, brought that countrie vnder his
<note place="marg">King Gregorie suffered the inhabitants of Northumberland to inioy their lands King Gregorie wintered a Berwike.</note>

<note place="marg">King Gregorie prepared an armie against the Britains.</note>
subiection: neuerthelesse he permitted the inhabitants to inioy all their possessions still, onelie receiuing of them in name of souereigntie a y&eacute;erelie tribute. So that within a few daies
after, he brake vp his armie, and went himselfe into Berwike, where he remained all the winter
season in consultation with his nobles about the publike affaires of the realme.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the next summer, he prepared againe for warre, and raising an armie,
be purposed to make a iournie against the Britains, who held (as before ye haue heard) a
great part of Scotland. But he was not driuen to vse anie force in this warre: for the Britains being vexed afore this time with warre by the Danes, had compounded with them for an
huge summe of monie to haue truce for twentie y&eacute;eres space: but the Danes without regard
to their promise, shortlie after (with a greater power than at the first) entered into the British
borders, renewing the warre so fiercelie, that albeit their force was sore enf&eacute;ebled, by reason
of the two last ouerthrowes; yet the Britains doubting the woorst, feared to incounter with
them, and therefore after consultation had, they thought it best to assaie if they might happilie allure the Scots, of their enimies to become their friends. H&eacute;erevpon sending vnto the
<note place="marg">The Britains send to king Gregorie.</note>
Scotish king an herald, they require to ioine with them in armes against the Danes, common
enimies to both their countries, promising that if they would so doo, they would willinglie ren
der into his hands all such possessions which they held at anie time belonging vnto the Scotish
kingdome.</p>
<p>Gregorie weieng with himselfe how necessarie this friendship should be, not onelie to the
<note place="marg">King Gregorie his consideration.</note>
publike weale of all the whole land of Albion, but also of the good suertie and aduancement
of Christes religion, whereof the Danes were greeuous aduersaries (for this he thought, that if
Scots, Englishmen, and Britains did ioine in one, and knit themselues togither in aiding each
other, there was no nation in the world that they n&eacute;eded to feare) he consented vnto the request of the Britains, and so accepting their offer, he had all those regions which perteined
<note place="marg">A peace concluded, and lands surrendered to the Scots.</note>
sometime to the Scots, and were now in possession of the Britains, surrendered into his hands,
and so by this means were the Scotish confines inlarged and extended vnto their owne ancient limits and former bounds.</p>
<p>This dissention and variance being ceassed after this maner, it greatlie reioised the minds of
all the inhabitants of this Ile, but contrariwise, the Danes looked for nothing more than present destruction to insue vpon them, if this amitie should continue anie while amongest them
enimies. Wherefore they practised sundrie means to breake th' amitie thus remaining betwixt their aduersaries, Scots, Englishmen, and Britains. Wherein they n&eacute;eded not greatlie
to trauell, for within a short time after the conclusion of the same league, the prosperous successe of the Englishmen (which for a season had followed them vnder the conduct and gouernement of their king Alured against the Danes) occasioned the Britains also (hauing now
<note place="marg">The Britains repent them of the league made with the Scots.</note>
no further feare of the Danish puissance) to repent themselues of the league, which they had
latelie made with the Scots, so that Constantine, whome a little before they had receiued to be
their king after the deceasse of his father, raised a power, and with the same entered into Annandale, to recouer that countrie out of the Scotishmens hands. But hearing in the end that
Gregorie was comming with a great armie to succour his subiects, whome the said Britains on
each side had sore afflicted, they began to draw backe towards Cumberland with their bootie,
thinking there to be in safetie, vntill a time more conuenient.</p>
<p>But king Gregorie coasting the countrie, met with them at Lochmaben, and there gaue
<note place="marg">The Scots ouerthrow the Britains.</note>
them battel, wherein when Constantine perceiued how his people began to shrinke backe, as
one hauing more regard to his honor than to the suertie of his life, he rushed foorth into the
formost prease, there to succour and relieue his standards: but being compassed about
amongest a great companie of his enimies, his chance was there to be slaine with a number of
<note place="marg">Constantine is slaine.</note>

them, fied to saue their liues, leauing the victorie so vnto the Scots.</p>
<p>This ouerthrow did put the Britains in danger to haue bin vtterlie ouerrun, what by the Scots
on the one side, and Danes ou the other: for as for forren aid to be looked for of the English,

they had plaine answer they should haue none, sith they had so vniustlie broken the league
concluded with their confederats the Scots, to the great hinderance of the prosperous proc&eacute;edings of all the inhabitants of this Ile, against their common enimies the Danes. Yet the
better to establish the estate of their countrie, and in hope of some recouerie of their former
damages; they crowned to their king one Herbert or (as some copies haue) one Hebert the
<note place="marg">Herbert king of Britaine sent ambassadors to Gregorie.</note>
brother of the last Constantine, and herewith sent ambassadours vnto Gregorie king of the
Scotishmen to excuse themselues, in that they had so wrongfullie attempted the warres against
him and his people, laieng all the fault in Constantine, who against the wils and contrarie
to the minds of his subiects, did take vpon him that dishonorable and most infortunat enterprise.</p>
<p>Gregorie hauing heard the message of these ambassadours, for answere declared vnto them,
<note place="marg">King Gregorie his answere.</note>
that he vnderstood well inough, that the Britains now sued for peace vpon no reuerend consideration they had vnto their oths of couenant; but onelie for that they saw how if they should
pursue the warre still, they were sure that in the end they should be like to haue the foile:
and therefore he was fullie thus resolued, not to conclude anie peace or truce with such disloiall people, till they had resigned ouer into his hands the whole possession of the countries of
<note place="marg">Gregorie required a resignation of Cumberland and Westmerland.</note>
Cumberland and Westmerland, with assurance neuer to pretend anie claime or title vnto those
dominions from thenceforth: and herewith for performance of couenants, to render into his
hands not onelie the keies of all the townes, castels and fortresses in the same countries, and
to auoid quite their waies into Wales to other their countriemen there, but also to deliuer sixtie
noble mens sonnes and heires apparant as pledges to remaine with the Scots.</p>
<p>The ambassadours returning home with this message, and reporting it accordinglie vnto
their king, when all men had said their aduise, in the end they condescended to conclude a
peace with the rehearsed conditions prescribed by the Scotish king, sith they saw no better
meane to preserue their nation from present destruction. And thus deliuering the appointed
number of pledges, they left the countries of Cumberland and Westmerland void, surrendering
<note place="marg">Peace was concluded.</note>
into the Scotishmens hands the possessions of all the townes, castels and fortresses, and
therewith departed into Northwales, where they placed themselues in the countrie betwixt
<note place="marg"><emph>Humf. Lhoid.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><date>870.</date></note>
Conway and the riuer of D&eacute;e, out of the which they expelled the Englishmen (that were then
in possession thereof) and therewith they erected a kingdome there, which they named Stradcluid, mainteining warres against the Englishmen manie yeares after.</p>
<p>King Gregorie hauing thus inlarged his kingdome, assembled his nobles at Carleill, where
he resolued (with their aduise) to follow such good fortune as by Gods prouidence dailie
chanced vnto them. Wherevpon it was agr&eacute;ed, that they should go first vnto Yorke to 
<note place="marg">The policie of the Scots to haue taken Yorke.</note>
conquere that citie, whilest the Englishmen in Kent were occupied with the Danes that were come
thither; so as neither the one nation nor the other could attend to make anie attempt to hinder the Scotishmens enterprise. But in the meane time came ambassadours vnto Gregorie
<note place="marg">King Alured sent ambassadours vnto king Gregorie.</note>
from king Alured, to congratulat his prosperous successe against his enimies the Danes and
others. These ambassadours also willed to haue the ancient league betwixt Englishmen and
Scots renewed, by which means both their powers might ioine togither against their common
enimies, when they should attempt anie wrongfull inuasion.</p>
<p>This request was granted, so that shortlie therevpon peace was established betwixt those
<note place="marg">Peace confirmed.</note>
princes and their people, with confirmation of the old league, whereto were added these articles; That the Scots should inioy possession of Northumberland without anie claime to be
<note place="marg">New conditions of peace.</note>

<note place="marg">No passage to be granted vnto the enimie.</note>

<note place="marg">Punishment of robbers.</note>
made to the same by the Englishmen ; If the Danes chanced to inuade either of their dominions, the warre should be accounted as common to them both ; Neither should the Scots grant
passage to anie enimie of the Englishmen through Scotland, neither the Englishmen suffer the
Scotishmens enimies to passe through England; If anie Englishmen did rob or steale anie
thing out of Scotland, that should not breake the league; but the offendors with the receiuers
should be deliuered to the Scotish magistrats, to be punished according to the qualitie of the
ofense; and the like should be obserued by the Scots towards the Englishmen.</p>
<p>Thus things being quieted with the Englishmen, as Gregorie was about to lay armour aside,
<note place="marg">Galloway inuaded by the Irish men.</note>
word came to him of new troubles forth of Galloway, by reason of an inuasion made by the

Irishmen into that countrie. For the Irishmen hauing knowledge that the inhabitants of Galloway had spoiled two ships of Dubline arriuing on their coast, sent ouer a great power of
men, the which landing in Galloway, made great slaughter of the people on each side. King
Gregorie being aduertised hereof, streitwaies made towards them, but they hauing knowledge
of his comming drew to their ships with a great prey of goods and cattels, and returned therewith immediatlie backe into their owne countrie.</p>
<p>Herevpon Gregorie without delaie got togither his ships and followed the enimie with all
his armie, and landing in Ireland, put the nobles of that realme in great feare, who as then
were in contention togither which of them should haue the gouernement, by reason their
king was latelie dead, and had left a sonne behind him being but a child in y&eacute;eres, to succ&eacute;ed
him in his throne. Some therefore of the wiser sort, and such as tendered the wealth of their
countrie, went earnestlie about to agree the parties, but when they saw that it would not be,
they did so much preuaile, that a truce was taken betwixt them for a while, least fighting still
<note place="marg">A truce was taken betwixt the two parties.</note>

<note place="marg">The two Irishmen gather their powers</note>

against whome when they had agr&eacute;ed vpon the foresaid truce, either of the factions raised a

were heads of the parties, betwixt whom the controuersie for the gouernement of the realme
rested, and therevpon by consent of the residue had the leading of all them that were of
their faction.</p>
<p>These two capteins with their armies incamped themselues vpon the banke of the riuer
<note place="marg">Two armies one n&eacute;ere the other.</note>

<note place="marg">The Irishmens practise.</note>
Bane, vnder the mounteine called Fute: their camps being seuered by a small distance the
one from the other, in such a strong place, that it was not possible for the enimies to approch them without manifest danger to cast away themselues. Their chiefe purpose was to
prolong the time here in this place, till they had famished the Scotish armie, and then to
deale with them at their pleasure. But the industrious prouision of Gregorie passed the politike deuise of the Irishmen: for he had commanded that euerie one of those Scotishmen, which
<note place="marg">The Scots had made prouision of vittels afore hand.</note>
passed the seas with him, should purueie himselfe of vittels, according to the custome of the
countrie, for fiftie daies space, as of bread, ch&eacute;ese, butter, lard, and powdered biefe: as
for drinke, they knew they should not n&eacute;ed to care, sith they were sure to find water inough
in euerie place where they chanced to come: for as yet filthie &amp; seruile gluttonie had not
softned nor inured* with wanton delicacie the warlike natures of the Scotish people.</p>
<note place="marg">[* <emph>Sic. qu. iniured.</emph>]</note>

<note place="marg">The kings deuise.</note>
<p>In the end Gregorie, hauing for certeine daies rested himselfe and his men, and deuising in
the meane time which way he might best indamage the enimies; at length concluded to send
in the night season two thousand of his souldiors vp to the ridge of the forenamed mounteine
called Fute, through the thicke bushes and woods, wherewith the same was couered, to the
end that getting to the top of that hill, right ouer where the Irish camps laie, they might in
the morning (at what time Gregorie with the rest of the armie went about to assaile his enimies) tumble downe stones from the browes of the hill vpon them, thereby either to destroy
great numbers of them, either else to constreine them to come foorth of their strength into the
plaine fields, and so to fight with them in a place indifferent.</p>
<p>Kenneth Cullan the thane of Carrike, tooke vpon him to haue the conduct of them that
<note place="marg">Kenneth Cullan.</note>

<note place="marg">King Greogorie assailed the Irishmen.</note>

the backeside of the mounteine, in the morning when their felows fell in hand to assaile the
Irish campe, where Bren lodged, they tumbled such plentie of mightie stones downe vpon th&eacute;
Irishmen, that aboue a thousand of them being slaine, all the residue were forced to forsake
their ground, &amp; to fl&eacute;e in maner without anie stroke striken. The Scots that were sent to
<note place="marg">The Irish are pursued.</note>
pursue them, tooke a great number of them prisoners, and slue but a few, hauing before hand
such commandement from their prince.</p>
<p>Whilest this mischiefe fell vpon Bren and his people, Cornelius with his folkes curssing
that infortunate daie, left their lodgings, and marched their waies in good order of battell,
till they were farre inough out of danger. The bodie of Bren also was found amongst other

in the rifling of the campe, with the head bruised in p&eacute;eces, and the braines dashed out with some

of some of the prisoners, caused to be buried in christian sepulchre. He caused also women
<note place="marg">Women and children are kept harmles.</note>

<note place="marg">Unarmed men were spared.</note>

<note place="marg">Vittels were commanded to be prouided.</note>
and children to be sent awaie harmelesse, onelie reteining the men of able age prisoners. Furthermore he commanded that they should vse neither fire nor sword, but against such onelie
as with weapon in hand made anie resistance: and commanded them also that they should
prouide themselues of vittels to serue them, whilest they should lie abroad &amp; remaine there
in that countrie.</p>
<p>Herevpon manie of the Irish people thus tasting the mercifull clemencie of the Scotish king,
y&eacute;elded themselues vnto him with sundrie fortresses, so that Gregorie finding sufficient prouision of vittels to serue his host for a long season, he went vnto the strong citie of Doungarg,

<note place="marg">The towne was y&eacute;elded.</note>
or Doungard, which he enuironed about with a strong siege, &amp; continuing the same certeine
daies, at length they within wearied with continuall trauell and lacke of vittels, opened the
gate, and suffered him to enter. He would not perit his men to meddle with anie of the
spoile, but appointed the townesmen to red&eacute;eme the same (their armour excepted) of his 
<note place="marg">A gentle ransome.</note>
souldiors for a p&eacute;ece of monie.</p>
<p>Afterward, tarieng in this citie by the space of thr&eacute;e daies, he departed and came afore
another citie called Pontus, which he receiued by surrender, and therfore preserued the 
<note place="marg">Pontus was surrendred also.</note>
citizens from all hurt &amp; annoiance. From thence he purposed to haue gone vnto Dublin,
about 14 miles distant from Pontus, but as he marched thitherwards, he was aduertised that

with all the chiefest nobles of the countrie, were an infinite companie of all sorts of souldiors,
chosen foorth of all the whole numbers. The Scots (according to their custome) diuided
themselues into two wings, and a middle ward, in euerie of the which were thr&eacute;e sorts of souldiors: as frist archers, and those with long speares, then bilmen, and last of all such as bare
long swoords and leaden malles.</p>
<p>Thus the battels being ordered on both parts, forward they make one towards another to
<note place="marg">Two battels ioine.</note>
begin the fight. The Scots (after their shot and throwing of darts was spent, and that they
came to ioine) kept off their enimies with long speares or iauelins, in such sort, that they were
not able to come n&eacute;ere them: which disaduantage Cornelius perceiuing, commanded on high,
that they should with their swoords cut those iauelins in sunder. And as he lifted vp the visor
of his helmet, the better to exhort his people to the execution hereof, he was so wounded in the

<note place="marg">The Irish ran away.</note>
face with a speare, that he was faine to withdraw apart out of the field. The Irishmen supposing he had fled, incontinentlie to saue themselues, threw off their armor and fell to running awaie. Thus did the victorie incline to the Scotish standards.</p>
<p>There died but a few (to speake of) in the battell, howbeit in the chase there was a woonderfull number slaine : for the Scots pursued them euen vnto Dublin gates, which citie the next
<note place="marg">Dublin besieged.</note>
daie Gregorie beset on each side with a mightie siege. There was got into this citie at the
same time a woonderfull multitude of people, what of such as were receiued into it fl&eacute;eing
from the battell, as also of other which were there assembled before, in hope of assured victorie and safegard of their goods. By reason wherof being thus besieged, they began quicklie to want vittels, so that either they must of necessitie yeeld, either else by some issue auoid
that danger wherein they were presentlie bewrapped.</p>
<p>But forsomuch as they saw no great likelihood of good successe in that exploit, in the end
it was concluded amongst them, that (sith there was no meane for those noble men which
were inclosed within that citie to escape the enimies hands, and that there were none other of
anie reputation abroad able to defend the countrie from the Scotishmens puissance) they should

<note place="marg">They consult vpon a treatie of peace to be made.</note>
as might be obteined: for other remedie in that present mischiefe they could deuise none, and
therefore this was iudged the best waie of the whole number, namelie of Cormach bishop of
Dublin, a man for his singular vertue and reputation of vpright life, of no small authoritie
amongst them.</p>
<p>He tooke vpon him also to go vnto Gregorie to breake the matter, &amp; so comming afore
<note place="marg">Cormach B. of Dublin went vnto K. Gregorie.</note>
his presence, besought him most humblie to haue compassion vpon the poore miserable citie,
and in such sort to temper his wrath, if he had conceiued anie p&eacute;ece of displeasure against
the citizens, that it might please him yet vpon their humble submission to receiue them vnto
his mercie, and further to accept into his protection his cousine yoong Duncane, vnto whome
<note place="marg">Duncane.</note>
the kingdome of Ireland was due of right, as all the world well vnderstood. He besought him
also to remember, that it apperteined more to the honor of a king, to preserue the lawfull
<note place="marg">A wittie saieng</note>
right of other kings and princes with the quiet state of cities and countries, than by violent
hand to s&eacute;eke their destruction.</p>
<p>Wherevnto the king answered, that he was not come into Ireland for anie couetous desire
<note place="marg">King Gregorie his wise &amp; godly answer.</note>
he had to the realme, or to the intent to spoile his kinsman of the gouernement thereof, but
onelie to reuenge such iniuries as the Irishmen had doone to his subjects. Not the Scots but
the Irishmen themselues were they that had giuen the occasion of the warre, which they had
d&eacute;erelie bought with no small portion of their bloud (which had bene shed) as punished for
that crime worthilie by the just iudgement of almightie God. But as touching an end to be
had of his quarell, &amp; for the reseruing of the kingdome vnto yoong Duncans behoofe, when
he had the citie at his pleasure, he would then take such order as he should thinke most conuenient.</p>
<p>This answer of the Scotish king being reported vnto them within the citie, they determined
<note place="marg">Dublin is surrendered vnto K. Gregorie.</note>
foorthwith to set open their gates to receiue him: who, when he had caused search to be made
whether all things were truelie ment according to the outward shew or not, he marched foorth
towards the citie to enter the same in order of battell, with all his whole armie, into the which
<note place="marg">Gregory was receiued with procession.</note>

<note place="marg">Cormach bishop of Dublin bec&omacr;meth a crosse-bearer.</note>
he was receiued with procession of all the estates: for first there met him all the priests and
men of religion, with the bishop the foresaid Cormach, who hauing vpon him his pontificall
apparell, bare in his hand the crucifix: then followed the nobles with the other multitude.</p>
<p>Which order when Gregorie beheld, he commanded his battell to staie a little, and therewith he himselfe aduanced foorth on foot till he came to the bishop, and falling downe vpon
his kn&eacute;es, he reuerentlie kissed the crucifix, wherevpon receiuing humble thanks with high
<note place="marg">He kisseth the Crucifix.</note>
commendation of the bishop for such his clemencie, he entered the citie, not staieng till he
came into the market place, where commanding one part of his armie to keepe their standing,
he went with the residue vnto the church of our ladie, and after to that of saint Patrike, where
hearing the celebration of diuine seruice, when the same was ended, h&eacute;e entered the castell,
<note place="marg">He entred the castell.</note>
where his lodging was prepared. In the morning he caused execution to be doone of certeine
vnrulie persons of his armie, who in the night passed had broken vp the houses of some
of the citizens, and rauished diuerse women. And for this act Gregorie being had in high
reuerence of the Irish people, lodged part of his armie within the citie, and part he commanded
to lodge without in the campe.</p>
<p>At length hauing remained a season in this estate at Dublin, he caused the Irish lords to

<note place="marg">K. Gregorie to haue the gouernment of the realme.</note>

<note place="marg">He should also appoint the magistrates.</note>
assemble in counceill, where in the end the peace was concluded betwixt him and them, with
these articles and couenants. First it was agr&eacute;ed that the yoong king Duncane should be
brought vp vnder the gouernement of wise and discr&eacute;et persons, to be instructed in all princelie knowledge, within a strong castell, (wherein he had hitherto remained euer since his fathers
decease) till he came to y&eacute;eres of discretion. And that in the meane time Gregorie should
haue the gouernance of the realme, receiuing all the fortresses into his possession. He should
also haue the appointment of the magistrates, who should s&eacute;e iustice ministred according to
the old statutes &amp; ordinances of the Irish kingdome. That the Irishmen should receiue neither Englishman, Britaine, nor Dane, into their countrie, no not so much as for trade of

backe into Scotland.</p>
<p>After this there chanced no notable trouble to the Scots, neither forreine nor ciuill, by all
the time of king Gregories reigne, so that passing the rest of his life in quietnesse, he studied
chieflie for the politike gouernement of his people in good order and rule, to the aduancement
of the common-wealth : and finallie died an happie old man, in a castell called Doundore

good quiet and flourishing in welth, he applied his whole studie to mainteine the same in semblable plight and condition. And before all things he caused iustice to be dulie ministred, so
<note place="marg">He was a good iusticier.</note>

<note place="marg">He was religious.</note>
that no iniurie, speciallie if it were doone to anie poore person, escaped vnpunished. Christ
the Lord of all vertue had giuen him such a godlie disposed mind, whose religion (to the aduancement of his glorie) he had euer in high veneration. Among other his godlie ordinances, he made this statute to be obserued as a law, that such as by swearing vnaduisedlie

<p>But to our purpose touching the gouernement of Donald, it chanced af erwards, that he

therefore all dangers, Donald hasted towards Northumberland; howbeit he was not farre
forwards on his iornie, but that word came to him, how Gormond was alreadie passed ouer
Humber, and entered into the English borders. But yet did not Donald staie his iournie,
till he heard certeinelie that Gormond k&eacute;eping vpon his way, was aduanced forward at the

least 40 miles off from the riuer of Humber, doubting least happilie he had ment some
deceit, as suddenlie to haue returned vpon the Scots in Northumberland, when the king had
b&eacute;ene once gone backe.</p>
<p>But now, when it was knowne that his purpose was onelie to assaile the English countries,
according to the league newlie confirmed, Donald sent 5000 Scotishmen vnto the aid of the
<note place="marg">Donald sent 5000 men to the aid of the Englishmen.</note>
Englishmen; and also appointed two thousand horssemen to remaine with him in Northumberland (where he staied for a time) discharging the residue, &amp; licencing them to returne
vnto their homes. Shortlie after Gormond fought with Alured at Abingdon, where in the
<note place="marg">Gormond is ouerthrowne by K. Alured.</note>
end the victorie abode with the Englishmen and Scots, though the same was got with such
losse of men after long and doubtfull battell, that they were not able to pursue the enimies
in chase, but constreined immediatly after to conclude a necessarie peace with them, on 
<note place="marg">A peace concluded.</note>
condition that the Danes should enioy common seats with the Englishmen in Albion, &amp; that

<p>Whilest things passed thus in England, there rose a p&eacute;ece of trouble betwixt the inhabitants of Murrey land and Rosse, which disquieted king Donald not a little. The occasion

grew by reason of certeine th&eacute;eues, which comming foorth of Rosse in the night time, secretlie entered into Murrey land, to fetch booties from thence. At the first they of Murrey

to aid them, they skirmished in such wise, that within two moneths space, there were slaine

to cleare themselues of the crime, he put them to open execution of death, to the example
of other. This trouble being in this sort quieted, he went into Northumberland, to be
there in a readinesse, if the Danes or Englishmen (whome he suspected) should attempt
anie thing against his subiects in those parties : where in the end, after he had reigned almost 11 y&eacute;ers, he departed this world. His bodie was buried in Colmekill amongst his

more than was thought requisite for the suertie either of the Englishmen or Scots, which

<p>Shortlie after also the warre was renewed betwixt the Englishmen and Danes, and a peace

to subdue the Englishmen, and to bring them to vtter destruction.</p>
<p>Malcolme sonne to king Donald was appointed by king Constantine to haue the leading of
the Scotish armie, conteining the number of twentie thousand men. The same Malcolme
also at the same time was created heire apparant of the realme, hauing Cumberland assigned
vnto him for the maintenance of his estate. And euen then it was ordeined, that he which
should succ&eacute;ed to the crowne after the kings deceasse, should euer inioy that prouince.
Malcolme ioining his power with Aualassus and Godfrie (who had assembled in like manner a mightie host of Danes) they all togither brake into the English confines, sparing no
kind of crueltie that might be deuised, murthering the people without anie pitie or compassion in all places where they came, to the intent that the Englishmen mooued with the
slaughter of their kinsfolks and friends, should come foorth into the field to giue battell,
supposing they should not be able to withstand the force of the Danes and Scotishmen now

politike sort as he would haue wished. And therefore, to rid himselfe of all such cares

that Malcolme gouerned as regent and not as king whilest Constantine liued, who departed

<head>MALCOLME.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">AFTER</hi> that Constantine (as is said) was entred into religion, the before named Malcolme the sonne of Donald was admitted king, or rather regent: who although he perceiued right well how the force of the realme was so inf&eacute;ebled, that there was no hope to
mainteine warres abroad; yet his chiefe studie was by all means possible to defend the
borders of the Scotish dominion, and before all things to procure peace with the Englishmen. But as he was about to haue sent ambassadours vnto king Athelstane, to haue treated
for peace, he was crediblie informed, how Athelstane had giuen Northumberland vnto
<note place="marg">Aualassus had giuen him Northumberland.</note>
Aualassus, and made a league with him to haue his aid against the Scots. Which newes
put Malcolme in woonderfull dread, for that he vnderstood how his realme was vnpurueied
of skilfull capteins to make resistance. Yet he caused a councell to be called, wherein when
<note place="marg">A councel called.</note>
such as were assembled proponed manie fond and childish reasons, it might happen there
was small hope of anie good conclusion; but euen as they were at a point to haue broken

had chanced betwixt the Danes and Englishmen being assembled togither in campe, they
<note place="marg">The Englishmen and the Danes fall out togither, and fight.</note>
had fought a right cruell and bloudie battell, the victorie in the end remaining with the
Englishmen, who ceased not to pursue the Danes in chase, so long as anie day light app&eacute;ered in the skie.</p>
<p>Aualassus with such Danes as he might get togither after that ouerthrow, fled into 
<note place="marg">Aualassus fled into Westmerland, rifled the Ile of Man, and got him into Ireland.</note>
Westmerland, and within thr&eacute;e daies after, in such ships as he found there vpon the coast, he
sailed ouer into the Ile of Man, and spoiling the same, with all the preie he passed from
thence ouer into Ireland. In the meane time king Athelstane hauing lost no small number
of his people in the foresaid battell, omitted his iournie-into Scotland, and lay still in Northumberland, no man vnderstanding what he intended to doo. Which newes were so

pleasant to the Scotishmen, that there was common supplications and processions made through
the whole realme, in rendering thanks to almightie God for deliuering the people by this
means from so great and present a danger.</p>
<p>Shortlie after came ambassadours from Athelstane vnto Malcolme, to mooue means for a
<note place="marg">Ambassadors sent vnto Malcolme.</note>
peace to be concluded betwixt the Scotish and English nations, according to the articles of
the old league, which motion was ioifullie heard of Malcolme, though he set a countenance
of the matter as though he passed not whether he had warre or peace: but in the end, for
that (as he said) peace was most necessarie for all parts, he shewed himselfe willing to
haue the old former league renewed betwixt the Englishmen and Scots, with anie reasonable conditions which should be thought requisite.</p>
<p>After the returne of the ambassadours, the league was newlie confirmed betwixt the two

with Danish inhabitants, should remaine to the Englishmen; and Cumberland with Westmerland to the Scots: vpon this condition, that he which should succeed as heire vnto the
crowne of Scotland after the kings deceasse, being heire apparant, should hold those regions,
and doo homage vnto the king of England as his vassall perpetuallie for the same. The
peace being thus established betwixt these nations, Indulph the sonne of Constantine the
third was proclamed prince of Cumberland, and inheritour to the crowne of Scotland.</p>

At length, as he rode about the prouinces of his realme, to s&eacute;e the lawes dulie ministred,
at Virine a village in Murrey land, where he caused iustice to be somewhat streictlie executed
vpon offendors, he was murthered in the night season by treason of a few conspirators, in

execution, according as they had deserued, being torne in p&eacute;eces with wild horsses, and
those p&eacute;eces sent vnto sundrie cities, where they were hanged vp on the gates and towers,

<note place="marg"><date>959.</date></note>

<note place="marg">The mistaking of the names and times of the English kings in the Scotish writers.</note>
we haue thought good to put you in remembrance, that either the Scots are deceiued in
their account of yeares; or else mistake the names of the kings of England: for where they
write that this Malcolme departed this life about the 22 yeare of Athelstane king of England,
that can not be; if Malcolms deceasse chanced in the yeare 959, for Athelstane was dead
long before that time, to wit, in the yeare 940, and reigned but sixt&eacute;ene yeares.</p>
<p>Moreouer, where the Scotish writers make mention of the warres which king Edmund
that succ&eacute;eded Athelstane had against Aulafe and the Danes of Northumberland, in the
daies of king Indulph that succ&eacute;eded Malcolme, it can not stand by anie means (if they
mistake not their account of yeares:) for the same Edmund was slaine in the yeare 948.
But verelie this fault in the iust account of yeares is but too common in the Scotish historie,
and therefore to him that should take vpon him to reforme the errors thereof in this behalfe,
it were necessarie to alter in a maner the whole course of the same historie. And therefore
we will not wish anie man to giue anie credit vnto their account in yeares, touching the
reignes of the English kings, further than they shall see them to agr&eacute;e with our writers,
whome in that behalfe we may more safelie follow, and by conferring the same with the
Scotish writers in some places, happilie perceiue the true time, aswell of the reignes of their
kings, as of acts doone, to fall out in yeares and seasons, much differing from their account:
whereof to admonish the reader, aswell here as in the English historie, we haue thought it
not impertinent.</p>
<p>And albeit that some may aske what reason we haue to mooue vs to doubt of their account
of years, more than we doo of that in our owne writers? We will referre the same vnto
their iudgements that are learned, and haue trauelled indifferentlie alike, aswell in perusing
the one as the other without affection. But as the errors are sooner found than amended,
so haue we thought good to set downe in the margent of this booke, the yeares as we find
them noted in the Scotish writers, speciallie in places where we differ anie thing from them,
because we will not s&eacute;eme by way of controlment to preiudice the authors, further than by
due consideration the well aduised reader shall thinke it expedient.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">BUT</hi> to my purpose. After the corps of Malcolme was once buried (according to the

Cumberland was placed in the marble chaire at Scone, there receiuing the crowne and other
the inuestures of the kingdome. In the administration whereof he continued for the space

messengers sent vnto him from Aualassus, to ioine with him in league against the Englishmen, in reuenge of that ouerthrow, which aswell the Danes as Scots had receiued at Broningfield, alledging that opportunitie was now offered, sith after the decesse of Athelstane,

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"the"</fw>-->

the Englishmen had created Edmund to be their king, a man of a dull wit, &amp; not fit for the
administration of high affaires: neither did the league concluded betwixt Athelstane and
Malcolme inforce anie impediment, but that he might enter the warre against the Englishmen, considering that both the princes that were the authors of that league were departed
out of this life, by whose deceasse the said league was ended.</p>
<p>But Indulph for answere herevnto declared, that the league was concluded betwixt 
<note place="marg">Indulph his answere.</note>
Malcolme and Athelstane, by great deliberation of aduise, and by consent of all the estates of
both realmes, taking their solemne oths for the true obseruing thereof, so that he could not,
vnlesse he should violate that oth, attempt anie thing to the breach of peace with the Englishmen, procuring the iust indignation of almightie God against him and his people in that

this kind of answere, as he that regarded not the honor of his realme and people, in letting
passe so great opportunitie to be reuenged of the Englishmen for the death of such Scots
as died in the ouerthrow at Broningfield, determined not to be noted with the like spot of
reproch: but with all speed sending for aid into Norwaie, prepared to passe ouer into England, vnder the conduct of Aualassus, who ioining his power with the Norwegians, which came

to his aid vnder the leading of a right valiant capteine called Rainold, transported with all
sp&eacute;ed ouer into Northumbeland, vnto whome the gouernnour there named Elgarine, acknowledging himselfe to be descended of the Danish bloud, y&eacute;elded all the castels, tounes &amp; forts,
promising to aid Aualassus against king Edmund to the vtrermost of his power.</p>
<p>These newes comming to the knowledge of Edmund, with all sp&eacute;ed he gathereth his power,
and sending into Scotland for such aid as he ought to haue from thence by couenants of the
league, there came vnto him ten thousand Scotishmen with ready wils to serue him in these
<note place="marg">10000 souldiers sent vnto king Edmund.</note>
his wars against the Danes. Then ioining his owne people with those Scotishmen, he set
forward towards the enimies. There were an 8000 Northumberland men with Aualassus,
the which vpon the first incounter with the Englishmen, fell streight to running away, which
made an open and readie breach vnto the English part, to atteine the victorie: for the
Danes being not able to resist the violent force of their enimies, incouraged now with the
flight of the Northumbers, were quicklie constreined to giue backe, and in the end to flee
amaine, the Englishmen and Scots following in the chase with such fiercenesse, that all such
as they ouertooke died vpon the sword, though they submitted themselues neuer so humblie
in requiring mercie.</p>
<p>Eigarine yet chancing to fall into his enimies hands was taken aliue: for so had Edmund
<note place="marg">Elgarine is taken prisoner.</note>
commanded, that if anie man might take him, he should in anie case saue his life, that he
might put him to death in most cruell wise, to the example of other.</p>
<p>After this, and for the space of three daies after the battell, Edmund lay still in the fields
n&eacute;ere vnto the place where they fought, and then repaired vnto Yorke, where Elgarine for
<note place="marg">Elgarine is drawen in p&eacute;eces.</note>
his treason was drawen in p&eacute;eces with wild horsses. There chanced also no notable trouble
in Albion, during the space of foure yeares after this said ouerthrow of the Danes with their
capteine Aualassus, who is also otherwise called Aulafe, as is to be s&eacute;ene in the English
histories, where the same make mention of the foresaid king Edmund, whome likewise they
affirme to be the brother of Athelstane, and not his sonne, as before is partlie touched.

assaieng to land with their whole armie, first in the Forth, then in the riuer of Taie; but yet
through such resistance as the Scots made, being assembled togither to k&eacute;epe them off, they

were faine to withdraw, and wasting alongst the coasts of Angus, the Marnes, Mar, and
Buthqhane, at length faining as though they would haue taken their course homewards,
they lanched foorth into the high seas. But within foure daies after returning againe to the

called Cullane, a countrie ioining vnto Buthqhane, putting such of the countrie people to flight,
as presented themselues to impeach their landing and inuasion.</p>
<p>But Indulph being aduertised hereof, forthwith assembling the whole power of his realme,
<note place="marg">King Indulph draweth n&eacute;ere towards the enimies.</note>
drew towards that part with such sp&eacute;ed, that he was come into Boen before his enimies were

abroad forraieng the same countrie, were called backe to the campe. But Indulph without

protracting of time came still forward, and vpon his approch to the enimies, he prepared to
giue battell, and with a short oration began to incourage his people to fight manfullie. But
before he could make an end, the Danes gaue the onset with such violence, that the battell a
<note place="marg">The Danes gaue the onset.</note>
long space continued doubtfull on both sides, the Danes on the one part and the Scots on the

with their capteins Dunbar and Grame began to appeare on the backe halfe of the Danes.
<note place="marg">A supplie sent vnto the Scots.</note>
With which sight they were put in such feare, that those which fought in the fore ward,
retired backe vnto the middle ward, whome the Scots eagerlie pursuing, beate downe euen till
they came vnto the reare ward, which coueting rather to die in the fight, than to giue backe,
and so to be slaine in the chase (for those in the reare ward were heauie armed men) continued
the battell more with a certeine stiffe stubbornes of mind, than with anie great force or forcast,
being so ouermatched as they were, &amp; forsaken of their fellowes: for other of the Danes,
namelie the archers and Kernes fied their waies, some towards their ships, and some here and

shot through the head with a dart, and so died; but not before he was reuenged of those his

in Cullane, a towne of Boene, and after translated vnto the abbie of Colmekill, and there interred amongest other his predecessors the Scotish kings. Indulph reignes about nine yeares

murmuring did spread not onelie among them in the lies, but also through all the other parts
of his realme, so that they ceased not to speake verie euill of the gouernement of things. In
<note place="marg">The king fell sicke.</note>
the meane time the king fell into a languishing disease, not so gr&eacute;euous as strange, that none
of his physicians could perceiue what to make of it. For there was s&eacute;ene in him no token,
that either choler, melancholie, flegme, or any other vicious humor did any thing abound,
whereby his bodie should be brought into such decaie and consumption (so as there remained
vnneth anie thing vpon him saue skin and bone.)</p>
<p>And sithens it appeared manifestlie by all outward signes and tokens, that naturall moisture
did nothing faile in the vitall spirits, his colour also was fresh and faire to behold, with such
liuelines of looks, that moe was not to be wished for; he had also a temperat desire and
appetite to his meate &amp; drinke, but yet could he not sl&eacute;epe in the night time by anie prouocations that could be deuised, but still fell into exc&eacute;eding sweats, which by no means might be
restreined. The physicians perceiuing all their medicines to want due effect, yet to put him in
some comfort of helpe, declared to him that they would send for some cunning physicians into
forreigne parts, who happilie being inured with such kind of diseases, should easilie cure him,
namelie so soone as the spring of the yeare was once come, which of it selfe should helpe much

<p>Howbeit the king, though be had small hope of recouerie, yet had he still a diligent care

<note place="marg">A rebellion practised.</note>
vnto the due administration of his lawes and good orders of his realme, deuising oft with his
councell about the same. But when it was vnderstood into what a perillous sicknesse he was
fallen, there were no small number, that contemning the authoritie of the magistrats, began
to practise a rebellion. And amongst the chiefest were those of Murrey land, who slaieng
sundrie of the kings officers, began to rage in most cruell wise against all such as were not
consenting to their misordered tumult. The kings physicians forbad in anie wise, that the
<note place="marg">The rebellion was kept fr&omacr; the kings knowledge.</note>
king should be aduertised of such businesse, for doubt of increasing his sicknes with trouble of
mind about the same. But about that present time there was a murmuring amongst the people, how the king was vexed with no naturall sicknesse, but by sorcerie and magicall art,

<p>Wherevpon, albeit the author of this secret talke was not knowne: yet being brought to

breaking into the house, found one of the witches rosting vpon a woodden broch an image of
<note place="marg">An image of wax rosting at the fire.</note>
wax at the fier, resembling in each feature the kings person, made and deuised (as is to be
thought) by craft and art of the diuell: an other of them sat reciting certeine words of inchantment, and still basted the image with a certeine liquor verie busilie.</p>
<p>The souldiers finding them occupied in this wise, tooke them togither with the image, and
<note place="marg">The witches were examined.</note>
led them into the castell, where being streictlie examined for what purpose they went about
such manner of inchantment, they answered, to the end to make away the king: for as the
<note place="marg">The whole matter is confessed.</note>
image did waste afore the fire, so did the bodie of the king breake foorth in sweat. And as
for the words of the inchantment, they serued to keepe him still waking from sl&eacute;epe, so that
as the wax euer melted, so did the kings flesh: by the which meanes it should haue come to

health, he gathered a power of men, &amp; with the same went into Murrey land against the rebels there, and chasing them from thence, he pursued them into Rosse, and from Rosse into
Cathnesse, where apprehending them, he brought them backe vnto Fores, and there caused
<note place="marg">The rebels are executed.</note>
them to be hanged vp, on gallows and gibets.</p>
<p>Amongest them there were also certeine yoong gentlemen, right beautifull and goodlie personages, being neere of kin vnto Donwald capteine of the castell, and had b&eacute;ene persuaded to
be partakers with the other rebels, more through the fraudulent counsell of diuerse wicked
persons, than of their owne accord: wherevpon the foresaid Donwald lamenting their case,
<note place="marg">Captein Donwald craued pardon for them but not granted.</note>
made earnest labor and sute to the king to haue begged their pardon; but hauing a plaine deniall, he conceiued such an inward malice towards the king (though he shewed it not outwardlie at the first) that the same continued still boiling in his stomach, and ceased not, till through
setting on of his wife, and in reuenge of such vnthankefulnesse, h&eacute;e found meanes to 
<note place="marg">Donwald conceiued hatred against the king.</note>
murther the king within the foresaid castell of Fores where he vsed to soiourne. For the king
being in that countrie, was accustomed to lie most commonlie within the same castell, hauing
a speciall trust in Donwald, as a man whom he neuer suspected.</p>
<p>But Donwald, not forgetting the reproch which his linage had susteined by the execution
of those his kinsmen, whome the king for a spectacle to the people had caused to be hanged,
could not but shew manifest tokens of great griefe at home amongst his familie: which his
wife perceiuing, ceassed not to trauell with him, till she vnderstood what the cause was of his
displeasure. Which at length when she had learned by his owne relation, she as one that
<note place="marg">Donwalds wife counselled him to murther the king.</note>
bare no lesse malice in hir heart towards the king, for the like cause on hir behalfe, than hir
husband did for his friends, counselled him (sith the king oftentimes vsed to lodge in his house
without anie gard about him, other than the garrison of the castell, which was wholie at his
commandement) to make him awaie, and shewed him the meanes wherby he might soonest
accomplish it.</p>
<p>Donwald thus being the more kindled in wrath by the words of his wife, determined to 
<note place="marg">The womans euill counsell is followed.</note>
follow hir aduise in the execution of so heinous an act. Whervpon deuising with himselfe for
a while, which way h&eacute;e might best accomplish his curssed intent, at length gat opportunitie,
and sped his purpose as followeth. It chanced that the king vpon the daie before he purposed to depart foorth of the castell, was long in his oratorie at his praiers, and there continued
till it was late in the night. At the last, comming foorth, he called such afore him as had

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"faith-"</fw>-->

<pb n="235"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"235"</fw>-->

faithfullie serued him in pursute and apprehension of the rebels, and giuing them heartie
thanks, he bestowed sundrie honorable gifts amongst them, of the which number Donwald
<note place="marg">The king rewarded his friends.</note>

<note place="marg">The king went to bed.</note>

<note place="marg">His chamberleins went to banketting.</note>
was one, as he that had b&eacute;ene euer accounted a most faithfull seruant to the king.</p>
<p>At length, hauing talked with them a long time, he got him into his priuie chamber, onelie with two of his chamberlains, who hauing brought him to bed, came foorth againe, and
then fell to banketting with Donwald and his wife, who had prepared diuerse delicate dishes,
and sundrie sorts of drinks for their reare supper or collation, wherat they sate vp so long,
till they had charged their stomachs with such full gorges, that their heads were no sooner got
to the pillow, but asl&eacute;epe they were so fast, that a man might haue remooued the chamber ouer
them, sooner than to haue awaked them out of their droonken sleepe.</p>
<p>Then Donwald, though he abhorred the act greatlie in heart, yet through instigation of his
wife hee called foure of his seruants vnto him (whome he had made priuie to his wicked intent before, and framed to his purpose with large gifts) and now declaring vnto them, after
what sort they should worke the feat, they gladlie obeied his instructions, &amp; sp&eacute;edilie going
about the murther, they enter the chamber (in which the king laie) a little before cocks
<note place="marg">The suborned seruants cut the kings throte.</note>
crow, where they secretlie cut his throte as he lay sl&eacute;eping, without anie buskling at all: and
immediatlie by a posterne gate they caried foorth the dead bodie into the fields, and throwing
it vpon an horsse there prouided readie for that purpose, they conuey it vnto a place, about
two miles distant from the castell, where they staied, and gat certeine labourers to helpe them
to turne the course of a little riuer running through the fields there, and digging a d&eacute;epe hole
in the chanell, they burie the bodie in the same, ramming it vp with stones and grauell so
<note place="marg">The king his buriall.</note>
closelie, that setting the water in the right course againe, no man could perceiue that anie thing
had b&eacute;ene newlie digged there. This they did by order appointed them by Donwald as is reported, for that the bodie should not be found, &amp; by bl&eacute;eding (when Donwald should be present) declare him to be guiltie of the murther. &para; For such an opinion men haue, that the
dead corps of anie man being slaine, will bl&eacute;ed abundantlie if the murtherer be present. But
for what consideration soeuer they buried him there, they had no sooner finished the worke,
<note place="marg">The poore laborers are slaine.</note>
but that they slue them whose helpe they vsed herein, and streightwaies therevpon fled into
Orknie.</p>
<p>Donwald, about the time that the murther was in dooing, got him amongst them that kept
<note place="marg">Donwald kept himselfe amongst the watchmen.</note>
the watch, and so continued in companie with them all the residue of the night. But in the
morning when the noise was raised in the kings chamber how the king was slaine, his bodie
conueied awaie, and the bed all beraied with bloud; he with the watch ran thither, as
<note place="marg">Donwald a verie dissembler.</note>
though he had knowne nothing of the matter, and breaking into the chamber, and finding
cakes of bloud in the bed, and on the floore about the sides of it, he foorthwith slue the chamberleins, as guiltie of that heinous murther, and then like a mad man running to and fro, he
ransacked euerie corner within the castell, as though it had b&eacute;ene to haue seene if he might
haue found either the bodie, or anie of the murtherers hid in anie priuie place: but at length
comming to the posterne gate, and finding it open, he burdened the chamberleins whome he
had slaine, with all the fault, they hauing the keies of the gates committed to their k&eacute;eping
all the night, and therefore it could not be otherwise (said he) but that they were of counsell
in the committing of that most detestable murther.</p>
<p>Finallie, such was his ouer earnest diligence in the seuere inquisition and triall of the 
<note place="marg">Some wiser than other.</note>

<note place="marg">The matter suspected.</note>
offendors h&eacute;erein, that some of the lords began to mislike the matter, and to smell foorth
shrewd tokens, that he should not be altogither cleare himselfe. But for so much as they
were in that countrie, where he had the whole rule, what by reason of his friends and authoritie togither, they doubted to vtter what they thought, till time and place should better serue
therevnto, and h&eacute;erevpon got them awaie euerie man to his home. For the space of six
<note place="marg">Prodigious weather.</note>
moneths togither, after this heinous murther thus committed, there app&eacute;ered no sunne by day,
nor moone by night in anie part of the realme, but still was the skie couered with continuall
clouds, and sometimes such outragious winds arose, with lightenings and tempests, that the
people were in great feare of present destruction.</p>

<head>CULENE.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">IN</hi> the meane time Culene prince of Cumberland, the sonne (as I haue said) of king
Indulph, accompanied with a great number of lords and nobles of the realme, came vnto
Scone, there to receiue the crowne according to the manner: but at his comming thither,
he demanded of the bishops what the cause should be of such vntemperate weather. Who
<note place="marg">The king asked the cause of the foule weather.</note>

<note place="marg">The bishops answer vnto the king.</note>
made answer, that vndoubtedlie almightie God shewed himselfe thereby to be offended most
highlie for that wicked murther of king Duffe: and suerlie vnlesse the offendors were tried
foorth and punished for that deed, the realme should f&eacute;ele the iust indignation of the diuine
iudgement, for omitting such punishment as was due for so greeuous an offense. Culene
h&eacute;erevpon required the bishops to appoint publike processions, fastings, and other godlie 
<note place="marg">The king required publike praiers to be had.</note>
exercises to be vsed of the priests and people, through all parts of the realme, for the good
appeasing of Gods wrath in this behalfe; and in such sort and manner as in semblable
cases the vse and custome in those daies was. He himselfe made a solemne vow, confirming
<note place="marg">The king made an oth.</note>
it with a like oth, before all the p&eacute;eres &amp; nobles there assembled, that he would not ceasse
till he had reuenged the death of king Duffe vpon the false inhabitants of Murrey land, to
the example of all other.</p>
<p>The multitude being present, getting them to armor, followed their prince, taking his
<note place="marg">The king went with an armie into Murrey land.</note>
iournie without further delaie towards Murrey land, the inhabitants of which region hearing
of his approch, and the cause of his comming, were striken with exc&eacute;eding feare: but
namelie Donwald, being giltie in conscience, doubted lest if he were put to torture, he
<note place="marg">A giltie conscience accuseth a man.</note>
should be inforced to confesse the truth. Whervpon without making his wife priuie to his
departure, or anie other of his familie, saue a few such as he tooke with him, he secretlie
got him to the mouth of the riuer of Spey, where finding a ship readie, he went aboord the
<note place="marg">Donwald geteth him secretlie awaie.</note>
same, purposing to haue fled his waies by sea into Norwaie: for this is the peculiar propertie
of a giltie conscience, to be afraid of all things, and either in gesture or countenance to bewraie it selfe, accounting flight most sure, if occasion may serue thereto. For this Donwald,
<note place="marg">The murther of the king is reuealed.</note>
whome no man (though some partlie suspected him) might well haue burdened with the
crime of his maisters death (by reason of his faithfull seruice shewed towards him afore
time) had he not thus sought to haue auoided the countrie, was now detected of manifest
treason, euerie man detesting his abhominable fact, and wishing him to be ouerwhelmed in
the raging flouds, so to paie the due punishment, which of right he owght, for his vile treson
in murthering his naturall lord.</p>
<p>Culene being heereof aduertised, passed ouer Spey water, and taking the castell of Fores,
<note place="marg">The castell of Fores is taken and all the inhabitants slaine.</note>
slue all that he found therein, and put the house to sacke and fire. Donwalds wife with
his thr&eacute;e daughters were taken: for Culene commanded, that whosoeuer could light vpon
them, should in anie wise saue their liues, and bring them vnto him. Which being doone,
he had them to the racke, where the mother vpon hir examination confessed the whole
<note place="marg">The murther is wholie confessed.</note>
matter, how by hir procurement chieflie hir husband was mooued to cause the d&eacute;ed to be
doone, who they were that by his commandement did it, and in what place they had buried
the bodie. H&eacute;ere would the multitude haue run vpon hir and torne hir in peeces, but that
they were restreined by commandement of an officer at armes. The K. with the residue
for that night rested themselues, and in the morning tooke order for due prouision of all
things necessarie to take vp the bodie of king Duffe, and then to conueie it vnto Colmekill,
<note place="marg">King Duffe his bodie to be taken vp Donwald is taken prisoner.</note>
there to be buried amongest his predecessors.</p>
<p>But as they were busie h&eacute;ereabout, woord came that the traitor Donwald was by shipwracke cast vpon the shore within foure miles of the castell, as though he were by Gods
prouision brought backe into his owne countrie to suffer worthie punishment for his demerits.
Wherevpon the inhabitants of the places next adioining tooke him, and kept him fast bound
till they knew further of the kings pleasure: who verie glad of the newes, sent foorth immediatlie a band of men to fetch him. They that were sent did as they were commanded:

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"237"</fw>-->

and being scarse returned, there came in diuerse lords of Rosse, bringing with them 
<note place="marg">Donwalds foure seruants were taken also.</note>
Donwalds foure seruants, which (as before is said) did execute the murther. Thus all the
offendors being brought togither vnto the place where the murther was both contriued and
executed, they were arrained, condemned, and put to death in maner as followeth, to the
great reioising of the people that beheld the same.</p>
<p>They were first scourged by the hangman, and then bowelled, their entrails being throwen
<note place="marg">Donwald with his confederats are executed.</note>
into a fire and burnt, the other parts of their bodies were cut into quarters, and sent vnto the
chiefest cities of the realme, and there set vp aloft vpon the gates &amp; highest towers, for example sake to all such as should come after, how heinous a thing it is to pollute their hands
in the sacred bloud of their prince. This dreadfull end had Donwald and his wife, before
he saw anie sunne after the murther was committed, and that by the appointment of the
most righteous God, the creator of that heauenlie planet and all other things, who suffereth
no crime to be vnreuenged, Those that were the takers of the murtherers were highlie
<note place="marg">Rewards giuen vnto the takers of those murtherers.</note>
rewarded for their paines and trauell therein susteined, being exempt from charges of going
foorth to the warres, and also of all manner of paiments belonging to publike duties, as tributes, subsidies, and such like.</p>
<p>These things being thus ordered, the bodie of king Duffe was taken vp, and in most
<note place="marg">The bodie of king Duffe honorablie buried.</note>
pompous manner conueied vnto Colmekill, accompanied all the waie by Culene, and a great
multitude of lords both spirituall and temporall, with other of the meaner states. There be
that haue written how his bodie (though it had laine six moneths vnder the ground) was
nothing impaired either in colour or otherwise, when it was taken vp, but was found as
whole and sound as though it had b&eacute;ene yet aliue, the skarres of the wounds onelie excepted. But to proc&eacute;ed, so soone as it was brought aboue the ground, the aire began to
<note place="marg">Maruellous things are s&eacute;ene.</note>
cleare vp, and the sunne brake foorth, shining more brighter than it had beene s&eacute;ene afore
time, to anie of the beholders remembrance. And that which put men in most deepe consideration of all, was the sight of manifold flowers, which sprang foorth ouer all the fields
immediatlie therevpon, cleane contrarie to the time and season of the y&eacute;ere.</p>
<p>Within a few yeeres after this, there was a bridge made ouer the water in the same place,
where the bodie had beene buried, and a village builded at the one end of the bridge, which
is called vnto this day, Kilflos, that is to say, the church of flowers: taking that name of
<note place="marg">Kilflos.</note>
the woonder there happened at the remoouing of the kings bodie, as the same authors would
s&eacute;eme to meane. But there is now (or was of late) a rich abbeie, standing with a verie
faire church, consecrat in the honor of the virgine Marie. Monstrous sights also that were
seene within the Scotish kingdome that y&eacute;ere were these: horsses in Louthian, being of
<note place="marg">Horsses eate their owne flesh.</note>

<note place="marg">A monstrous child.</note>

<note place="marg">A sparhawke strangled by an owle.</note>
singular beautie and swiftnesse, did eate their owne flesh, and would in no wise taste anie
other meate. In Angus there was a gentlewoman brought foorth a child without eies, nose,
hand, or foot. There was a sparhawke also strangled by an owle. Neither was it anie
lesse woonder that the sunne, as before is said, was continuallie couered with clouds for six
moneths space. But all men vnderstood that the abhominable murther of king Duffe was
the cause h&eacute;ereof, which being reuenged by the death of the authors, in maner as before is
said; Culene was crowned as lawfull successor to the same Duffe at Scone, with all due
honor and solemnitie, in the yeere of our Lord 972, after that Duffe had ruled the Scotish

such as were inclined vnto licentious liuing, followed their sensuall lusts and vnbridled 
<note place="marg">He followes his sensuall lustes.</note>
libertie, abandoning all feare of correction more than ever had b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene or heard of in
anie other age. For such was the negligence of the king, or rather maintenance of misordered persons, that whatsoeuer anie of the nobilitie did either against merchants, priests,

<!--<fw place="top-left">"238"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

or anie of the commons, though the same were neuer so great an iniurie, there was no
<note place="marg">Euill dooers were not punished.</note>
punishment vsed against them: so that all men looked for some commotion in the commonwealth therevpon to insue, if there were not other order prouided therefore in time. The
ancient p&eacute;eres of the realme also being gr&eacute;eued thereat, spared not to admonish the king
<note place="marg">Good councsell was not heard.</note>
of his dutie, declaring vnto him into what danger the realme was likelie to fall through his
negligent behauiour.</p>
<p>Culene answered them, that he wist well inough how yoong men were not at the first
<note place="marg">The kings answer vnto his graue p&eacute;eres.</note>
borne graue and sage personages, like to them with hoarie heads: wherefore their first
youthfull y&eacute;eres could not be so stable as they might be h&eacute;ereafter by old age and continuance of time. But as for such rigorous extrenitie as diuerse of his elders had vsed towards
their subiects, he minded not (as he said) to follow, being taught by their example (as by
the kings, Indulph, Duffe, and such other) into what danger he might incurre by such
sharpe seueritie shewed in the gouernment of the estate. Wherevpon he was determined
so to rule, as he might giue cause rather to be beloued than feared, which was the onelie
<note place="marg">He would not displease.</note>
meane (as he thought) to reteine his subiects in due and most faithfull obedience. This
answer was such, that although it s&eacute;emed nothing agr&eacute;eable for the preseruation of the publike state in quiet rest and satetie, yet was there no man, by reason of his regall authoritie,
that durst reprooue the same, but diuerse there were that praised him therein, as those that
hated all such as loued the vpright administration of iustice.</p>
<p>But such ancient councellors as had trulie serued in rule of the common wealth in the
daies of the former kings, Indulph &amp; Duffe, misliking the state of that present world (wherin
the youth of the realme, namelie all such as were descended of noble parentage, and vsed
<note place="marg">Ancient councellors leaue the court.</note>
to be about the king, followed their wilfull &amp; sensuall lusts, growing euerie day through
want of correction to be woorse and woorse) departed from the court, and withdrew to
their homes, without medling anie further with the publike administration. In whose place
there crept in others, that with their flatterie corrupted the residue of such sparks of good
<note place="marg">The youthful court followeth their sensuall lusts.</note>
inclination as yet remained in the king, if anie were at all; insomuch that in the end he
measured supreame felicitie by the plentifull inioieng of voluptuous pleasures and bodilie
lusts. He fansied onelie such as could deuise prouocations thervnto, and in filling the belfie
<note place="marg">A wicked time of voluptuousnesse.</note>
with excesse of costlie meates and drinks, those that could excell other were chieflie cherished, and most highlie of him esteemed.</p>
<p>Heerewithall he was giuen vnto leacherie beyond all the bounds of reason, sparing neither
<note place="marg">A leacherous king.</note>

<note place="marg">Forcing of womenkind exc&eacute;eded.</note>
maid, widow, nor wife, prophane nor religious, sister nor daughter (for all was one with
him) that to heare of such villanie and violent forcings as were practised by him and his
familiars, it would loth anie honest hart to vnderstand or remember. He was so farre past
all shame in this behalfe, that when his leacherous lust by too much copulation was so
tired, that he might no more exercise his former lewdnesse, he tooke speciall pleasure yet
<note place="marg">O beastlie behauiour!</note>
to behold other to doo it in his presence, that his decaied lust might be the more stirred
vp with sight of such filthinesse. This abhominable trade of life he practised for the space
of thr&eacute;e yeeres togither, giuing occasion of much spoile, rauine, manslaughter, forcings, and
rauishments of women, with all such kind of wicked and diuelish transgressions: no execution of lawes (instituted by authoritie of the former kings, for restreint of such flagitious
<note place="marg">All honestie exiled.</note>
offenses) being put in vre, through negligence of this monstruous creature.</p>
<p>So farre foorth also increased the libertie of th&eacute;eues, robbers, and other offendors, 
<note place="marg">Robberie, theft, &amp;c were mainteined.</note>
mainteined by such of the nobilitie as consented vnto their vnlawfull dooings, and were partakers
with them in the same, that if anie man went about to withstand them, or refused to accomplish their requests and demands, he should be spoiled of all that he had, and happilie haue
his house burnt ouer his head, or otherwise be misused in such outragious and violent sort,
that it would gr&eacute;eue all those that had anie zeale to iustice, to heare of such enormities
as were dailie practised in that countrie. Howbeit, at length the death of king Culene
<note place="marg">Death made an end of all.</note>
brought an end to all such wicked dealings: for falling into a filthie disease (through

in such wise by rotting of his flesh, that he app&eacute;ered more like vnto a dead carcase, than
vnto a liuelie creature, insomuch that his owne sentants began to abhor him.</p>
<p>Wherevpon the lords and other honorable personages of the realme, vnderstanding his
case, caused a parlement to be summoned at Scone, where they determined to depose king
<note place="marg">A parlement.</note>
Culene, and appoint some other (whome they should iudge most m&eacute;etest) to reigne in his
place. Culene also not knowing wherefore this councell was called, as he was going thitherwards, at Meffen castell, being almost in the mid waie of his iournie, was murthered by one
<note place="marg">King Culene was murthered.</note>
Cadhard the thane of that place, whose daughter he had rauished before time amongst
diuerse other. This end had Culene togither with all his filthie sensualitie: but the reprochfull infamie thereof remaineth in memorie with his posteritie, and is not like to be forgotten whilest the world goeth about. He was thus dispatched in the fift y&eacute;ere of his reigne,
and after the birth of our Sauiour 976, the nobles &amp; great p&eacute;eres of the realme reioising at

<head>KENNETH.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">AFTER</hi> that the bodie of king Culene was once conueied vnto Colmekill, and there buried
amongst his elders, the nobles and great p&eacute;eres assembled togither at Scone, where they
proclaimed Kenneth the sonne of Malcolme the first, and brother vnto Duffe, king of the
realme. In the beginning of his reigne, he had inough to doo to reduce the people from
<note place="marg">Ill life is reformed.</note>
their wild and sauage kind of life (into the which they were fallen through the negligent gouernment of his predecessor) vnto their former trade of ciuill demeanor. For the nature
of the Scotishmen is, that first the nobles, and then all the residue of the people transforme
themselues to the vsage of their prince: therefore did Kenneth in his owne trade of liuing
<note place="marg">King Kenneth was of a vertuous liuing.</note>
shew an example of chastitie, sobrietie, liberalitie, and modestie, misusing himselfe in no
kind of vice, but refraining himselfe from the same. He banished all such kind of persons
as might prouoke either him or other vnto anie lewd or wanton pleasures. He mainteined amitie

aswell with strangers as with his owne people, punishing most rigoroushe all such as sought

to auoid sloth, and to applie themselues in honest exercises, iudging (as the truth is) that
to be the waie to aduance the common-wealth from decaie to a flourishing state.</p>
<p>Thus when he had somewhat reformed the misorders of his subiects, he indeuored 
<note place="marg">He did punish offendors.</note>
himselfe by all meanes he could deuise to punish offendors against the lawes and wholesome
ordinances of the realme, and to purge all his dominions of th&eacute;eues, robbers, and other such

fled secretlie their waies, some into the westerne lies, and some into other places, where
<note place="marg">The giltie ran awaie.</note>
they thought most expedient for safegard of their liues. The king perceiuing that through
the disloiall meanes of the lords his purpose was so hindered, that he might not minister

whereby he might fetch againe the offendors vnto iudgement: but this was kept close till
the y&eacute;ere following, for doubt least if those lords which bare them good will had come to
anie inkling thereof, they would by vttering it haue disappointed his purpose.</p>
<p>at length, after a yeere was passed, he appointed all the lords and nobles of his realme to

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"assemble"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"240"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

assemble at Scone, as though it had b&eacute;ene to haue communed about some weightie affaires
<note place="marg">An assemblie had at Scone.</note>
touching the state of the realme. The night then before they should come togither into the
councell-chamber, he caused by some of his faithfull ministers, a sort of armed men to be
<note place="marg">Armed men laid in wait.</note>
laid close in a secret place, with commandement giuen to their capteine, that in no wise he
should stirre with his band till the next day that all the lords were assembled togither, and
then without delaie to execute that which should be giuen him in commandement. On
the morrow after the nobles comming togither into the councell-chamber, they had no
<note place="marg">The king and lords sitting, the armed men step foorth.</note>
sooner taken their places, euerie one according to his degr&eacute;e about the king, but that the
armed men before mentioned, came rushing into the house, placing themselues round about
them that were set, according to the order prescribed by former appointment. The lords
with this present sight being much amazed, beheld one an other, but durst not speake a
woord. Then the king perceiuing their feare, began to declare vnto them the whole cause
<note place="marg">The king putteth the lords out of doubt.</note>

<note place="marg">An oration made by the king.</note>

<note place="marg">A rehearsall of all enormities.</note>
of his calling them to councell at that time, and why he had appointed those armed men to
be there attendant. The effect of his oration there made vnto them was, that he had not
caused those armed men to come into the chamber for anie harme ment towards anie of
their persons, but onelie for the publike preseruation of the realme. For so much as they
knew, there was one kind of people much noisome to the common-wealth, being confederate
as it were togither by one consent to exercise all sorts of mischiefe and oppression against
the poore people, as to rob, spoile, and take from them all that they had, to rauish their
wiues, maids, &amp; daughters, and some times to burne their houses: the which licentious
libertie in such wicked persons, through want of due punishment in the daies of king
Cuiene, what danger it had brought vnto the whole state of the Scotish common-wealth,
there was none but might well vnderstand.</p>
<p>For sith it was so, that the lords and other high estates liued by the trauell of the commons, then if the same commons should in anie wise decaie, the lords and such other high
estates could in no wise prosper: for if the labourer through iniurie of the robber were
forced to giue ouer his labour; where should the lord or gentleman haue wherevpon to
liue? So that those which robbed the husbandman, robbed also the lord and gentleman
and they that sought to mainteine such loitering persons as vsed to rob the poore man,
went about the destruction both of king, lord, and gentleman; yea and finallie of the vniuersart state of the whole common-wealth. Therfore he that loued the common-wealth,
would not s&eacute;eke onelie to defend the commons from such iniuries as th&eacute;eues and robers
dailie offered them; but also would helpe to s&eacute;e iust execution doone vpon the same th&eacute;eues
and robbers, according to the laudable lawes and customes of the land. "The last yeare
(said he) you your selues remember (I thinke) how I purposed by your helpe and counsell
to haue proc&eacute;eded by order of the lawes against all enimies and perturbers of the peace.
At Lainrike was the day appointed for them to haue appeared, but there was not one of
<note place="marg">Lainrike, or Lanerke.</note>
them that would come in, but contemptuouslie disobeieng our commandement kept them
awaie, by whose counsell I know not. But I haue b&eacute;ene informed by some how diuers of
you fauoring those rebels, by reason they were of your linage, were of counsell with them,
in withdrawing themselues so from iudgement.</p>
<p>"The often sending of messengers betwixt them and you, well n&eacute;ere persuaded vs to thinke
that this report was true. But yet notwithstanding, I haue put away all such sinister suspicion
out of my head, wishing you (as I trust you be) void of all such dissimulation. And now
I require you, not as fautors of the rebelles, but as defendors of the common-wealth, though
happilie somewhat slacke heretofore in discharge of your dueties, to shew your selues such
in helping to apprehend the offendors, as that the world may perceiue you to haue made
full satisfaction for your fault and error, if before in you there were anie." In the end he
was plaine with them, and told them flatlie that they should assure themselues to haue those
armed men which they saw there present, to be continuallie attendant about them, till he
might haue all the rebelles at commandement.</p>
<p>The lords hauing heard the kings sp&eacute;ech, and perceiuing what his meaning was, first

partlie excused themselues so well as they might of their cloked dissimulation, and then
<note place="marg">The lords gentle submission, with a large promise.</note>
falling downe vpon their kn&eacute;es afore him, besought him to put away all displeasure out of
his mind, and clearelie to pardon them, if in anie wise they had offended his maiestie, promising that they would with all diligence and faithfulnesse accomplish his desire, in causing
the offendors to be brought in vnto iudgement: and till the time that this were brought to
passe, they were well contented to remaine in such place where he should appoint them to
abide. The councell then being broken vp, the king with those lords passing ouer the
<note place="marg">The king went to Bertha.</note>
riuer of Taie, went vnto Bertha, which towne during the kings abode in the same, was
streictlie kept with watch and ward, that no creature might enter or go foorth without
knowledge of the officers appointed by the king to take h&eacute;ed therevnto. If anie idle person
<note place="marg">Roges punished.</note>
were espied abroad in the str&eacute;ets, streightwaies the sergeants would haue him to ward.</p>
<p>The nobles remained in the kings house, or in other lodgings to them assigned, procuring
by their friends and ministers to haue such offendors as vsed to rob and spoile the 
<note place="marg">Iniurious men brought vnto Bertha.</note>
husbandman, apprehended and brought to the king to Bertha, there to receiue iudgement &amp; punishment according to their merits: for so they perceiued they must n&eacute;eds worke, if they
minded the safegard of their owne liues. Hereof it followed also, that within short space
after, there were brought vnto Bertha to the number n&eacute;ere hand of fiue hundred such idle
<note place="marg">A great number of vagabonds were iudged to die.</note>
loiterers as vsed to liue by spoile and pillage, manie of them being descended of famous
houses: all which companie being condemned for their offenses to die, were hanged vp on
gibbets about the towne, and commandement giuen by the king, that their bodies should
not be taken downe, but there to hang still to giue example to other, what the end was of
all such as by wrongfull means sought to liue idelie by other mens labours.</p>
<p>The rebelles being thus executed, king Kenneth licenced the lords to depart to their owne
<note place="marg">The lords haue licence to depart.</note>
houses, exhorting them to remember their duties towards the common-wealth, and to studie
for preseruation of peace and quietnesse according to their vocation. After this, the realme
continued in quietnesse without anie forraine or inward trouble for the space of certeine
yeares following, and had remained in the same state still, if the Danes had not made a new

<note place="marg">The Danes take the sea to go into Albion.</note>
inuasion, who being sore greeued in their hearts for such displeasures as they had susteined
in Albion, determined now with great assurance to reuenge the same. Wherevpon gathering an huge multitude of men togither, they were imbarked in vessels prouided for them;
and sailing foorth, they purposed to take land vpon the next coast of Albion where they
should chance to arriue; &amp; being once on land, to destroie all before them, except where
the people should submit &amp; yeeld themselues vnto them. This nauie being once got abroad,
within short time arriued at that point of land in Angus, which is called the red Braies, or
<note place="marg">The Danes arriue at the red head, or red Braies in Angus.</note>
red head, not far from the place where the abbie of Abirbroth, or Abirbrothoke was afterward founded.</p>
<p>Here the Danish fl&eacute;et first casting anchor, their capteins fell in consultation what they
were best to doo. Some of them were of this opinion, that it was not most expedient for
them to land in that place, but rather to passe from thence into England; for at the 
<note place="marg">The Danes consult to go into England.</note>
Scotishmens hands being poore, and yet a fierce and hardie nation, there was small good to be got,
being thereto accustomed to giue more ouerthrowes than they commonlie receiued. Againe,
the soile of that countrie was but barren, and in manner ouergrowen with woods (as it
was in d&eacute;ed in those daies) with few townes &amp; small habitations, and those so poore, that
no man knowing the same, would vouchsafe to fight for anie possession of them: wherein
contrariwise England (that part namelie which lieth towards the south) was so fruitfull of
corne and cattell, so rich of mines, and replenished with so manie notable cities and townes
inhabited with men of great wealth and substance, that few were to be found comparable
thereto. So that the matter being well considered, they could not doo better, than to
saile into Kent, where they might be sure of rich spoile, without anie great resistance.
Other there were that held how that this iournie was attempted by the counsell of their

<note place="marg">They onelie sought reuenge.</note>
superiors, onelie to reuenge such iniuries as the Danish nation had receiued at the hands of

<p>The Scots also being a cruell people, &amp; readie to fight in defense of other mens possessions (as in the warres of Northumberland it well appeared) would suerlie be readie to
come to the aid of the Englishmen into Kent, euen so soone as it was knowen that the
Danes were on land in those parts: so that by this means they should be constreined to haue
to doo both with the Scotishmen and Englishmen, if they first went into Kent: where if they
set on land here in Scotland, they should incounter but onelie with the Scots. Therefore, the
best were according to their first determination, to land amongest the Scots, sith chance had
<note place="marg">Some thought best to land in Scotland.</note>
brought them vnto those coasts; adding that when they had somewhat abated the arrogant presumption of their enimies there, then might they passe more safelie into England, after a luckie
beginning of fier and sword, to proceed against their aduersaries in those parties as fortune
should lead them. This deuise was allowed of the greatest number, being glad to get beside
the water. Wherevpon the mariners (vpon commandement giuen) drew with their ships into
the mouth of the riuer called Eske, the which in those daies washed on the walles of a towne
in Angus called then Celurke, but now Mountros. Here the Danes taking land, put the 
<note place="marg">The Danes doo land at Mountros.</note>

<note place="marg">Mountros taken, and all within was slaine.</note>
inhabitants of the countrie thereabouts in great feare, so that with all sp&eacute;ed for their safegard
they got them into Mountros: but the towne being quickelie assailed of the Danes, was taken,
put to the sacke, and after raced, castell and all to the bare ground, not one liuing creature
being left aliue of all such as were found within the same.</p>
<p>From thence the armie of the Danes passed through Angus vnto the riuer of Taie, all the
<note place="marg">The Danes come to the riuer of Taie.</note>

<note place="marg">King Kenneth gathered a great armie.</note>
people of the countries by which they marched fl&eacute;eing afore them. King Kenneth at the
same time laie at Sterling, where hearing of these gr&eacute;euous newes, he determined foorthwith
to raise his people, &amp; to go against his enimies. The assemblie of the Scotish armie was appointed to be at the place where the riuer of Erne falleth into the riuer of Taie. Here when they
were come togither in great numbers at the day appointed, the day next following word was
brought to the king, that the Danes hauing passed ouer Taie, were come before the towne of
<note place="marg">They laie siege before Bertha.</note>
Bertha, and had laid siege to the same. Then without further delaie, he raised with the whole
armie, and marched streight towards his enimies, comming that night vnto Loncart a village not
far distant from the riuer of Taie, famous euer after, by reason of the battell fought then n&eacute;ere
vnto the same. The Danes hearing that the Scots were come, detracted no time, but foorthwith prepared to giue battell.</p>
<p>Kenneth as soone as the sunne was vp, beholding the Danes at hand, quickelie brought his
<note place="marg">King Kenneth set his men in aray.</note>
armie into order. Then requiring them earnestlie to shew their manhood, he promiseth to reease them of all tributs and paiments due to the kings cofers for the space of fiue yeares next
insuing: and besides that he offered the summe of ten pounds, or else lands so much woorth in
value to euerie one of his armie, that should bring him the head of a Dane. He willed them
<note place="marg">The king exhorted the Scots vnto valiantnesse.</note>
therefore to fight manfullie, and to remember there was no place to atteine mercie; for either
must they trie it out by dint of swoord, or else if they fled, in the end to looke for present
death at the enimies hands, who would not ceasse till time they had found them foorth, into
what place so euer they resorted for refuge, if they chanced to be vanquished. The Scots
being not a little incouraged by the kings words, kept their order of battell according as they
were appointed, still looking when the onset should be giuen. Malcolme Duffe prince of

<note place="marg">The Danes had the aduantage of a little mounteine.</note>
Cumberland led the right wing of the Scots; and Duncane lieutenant of Atholl the left:
King Kenneth himselfe gouerned the battell. The enimies on the other part had taken their
ground at the foot of a little mounteine right afore against the Scotish campe. Thus both the
armies stood readie ranged in the field, beholding either other a good space, till at length the
Scots desirous of battell, and doubting least the Danes would not come foorth to anie euen
ground, aduanced forward with somewhat more hast than the case required, beginning the 
<note place="marg">The Scots begin the battell.</note>
battell with shot, and throwing of darts right freshlie.</p>
<p>The Danes being backed with the mounteine, were constreined to leaue the same, and with
all sp&eacute;ed to come forward vpon their enimies, that by ioining they might auoid the danger of
the Scotishmens arrowes and darts: by this meanes therefore they came to hand strokes, in
maner before the signe was giuen on either part to the battell. The fight was cruell on both

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"sides:"</fw>-->

sides: and nothing hindered the Scots so much, as going about to cut off the heads of the
Danes, euer as they might ouercome them. Which maner being noted of the Danes, and
perceiuing that there was no hope of life but in victorie, they rushed foorth with such violence
vpon their aduersaries, that first the right, and then after the left wing of the Scots, was 
<note place="marg">The two wings of the Scots fled.</note>
constreined to retire and fl&eacute;e backe, the middle-ward stoutly yet k&eacute;eping their ground: but the
same stood in such danger, being now left naked on the sides, that the victorie must n&eacute;eds
haue remained with the Danes, had not a renewer of the battell come in time, by the appointment (as is to be thought) of almightie God.</p>
<p>For as it chanced, there was in the next field at the same time an husbandman, with two of
his sons busie about his worke, named Haie, a man strong and stiffe in making and shape of
<note place="marg">Haie with his two sonnes.</note>
bodie, but indued with a valiant courage. This Haie beholding the king with the most part of
the nobles, fighting with great valiancie in the middle ward, now destitute of the wings, and
in great danger to be oppressed by the great violence of his enimies, caught a plow-beame in
his hand, and with the same exhorting his sonnes to doo the like, hasted towards the battell,
there to die rather amongest other in defense of his countrie, than to remaine aliue after the discomfiture in miserable thraldome and bondage of the cruell and most vnmercifull enimies.
There was n&eacute;ere to the place of the battell, a long lane fensed on the sides with ditches
and walles made of turfe, through the which the Scots which fled were beaten downe by the
enimies on heapes.</p>
<p>Here Haie with his sonnes, supposing they might best staie the flight, placed themselues
<note place="marg">Haie staied the Scots fr&omacr; running away.</note>
ouerthwart the lane, beat them backe whome they met fleeing, and spared neither friend nor
fo: but downe they went all such as came within their reach, wherewith diuerse hardie personages cried vnto their fellowes to returne backe vnto the battell, for there was a new power
of Scotishmen come to their succours, by whose aid the victorie might be easilie obteined of
<note place="marg">The Scots were driuen to their battell againe.</note>
their most cruell aduersaries the Danes: therefore might they choose whether they would be
slaine of their owne fellowes comming to their aid, or to returne againe to fight with the enimies. The Danes being here staied in the lane by the great valiancie of the father and the
<note place="marg">The Danes fled towards their fellowes in great disorder.</note>
sonnes, thought verely there had b&eacute;ene some great succors of Scots come to the aid of their
king, and therevpon ceassing from further pursute, fled backe in great disorder vnto the other
of their fellowes fighting with the middle ward of the Scots.</p>
<p>The Scots also that before was chased, being incouraged herewith, pursued the Danes vnto
the place of the battell right fiercelie. Wherevpon Kenneth perceiuing his people to be thus
<note place="marg">K. Kenneth called vp&omacr; his men to remember their duties.</note>
recomforted, and his enimies partlie abashed, called vpon his men to remember their duties,
and now sith their aduersaries hearts began (as they might perceiue) to faint, he willed them
to follow vpon them manfully, which if they did, he assured them that the victorie vndoubtedlie should be theirs. The Scots incouraged with the kings words, laid about them so earnestlie, that in the end the Danes were constreined to forsake the field, and the Scots egerlie
<note place="marg">The Danes forsake the fields.</note>
pursuing in the chase, made great slaughter of them as they fled. This victorie turned highlie to the praise of the Scotish nobilitie, the which fighting in the middle ward, bare still the
brunt of the battell, continuing manfullie therein euen to the end. But Haie, who in such
wise (as is before mentioned) staied them that fled, causing them to returne againe to the field,
deserued immortall fame and commendation: for by this meanes chieflie was the victorie atchiued. And therefore on the morrow after, when the spoile of the field and of the enimies
<note place="marg">The spoile is diuided.</note>
campe (which they had left void) shuld be diuided, the chiefest part was bestowed on him
and his two sonnes, by consent of all the multitude; the residue being diuided amongst the
souldiers and men of warre, according to the ancient custome vsed amongst this nation.</p>
<p>The king hauing thus vanquished his enimies, as he should enter into Bertha, caused costlie robes to be offered vnto Haie and his sonnes, that, being richlie clad, they might be the
<note place="marg">Haie refused costlie garments.</note>

<note place="marg">The king came to Bertha.</note>
more honoured of the people: but Haie refusing to change his apparell, was contented to go
with the king in his old garments whither it pleased him to appoint. So entring with the kinginto Bertha, he was receiued with little lesse honor than the king himselfe, all the people running foorth to behold him, whome they heard to haue so valiantlie restored the battell, when

the field was in maner lost without hope of all recouerie. At his entring into the towne he bare
on his shoulder the plow-beame, more honourable to him than anie sword or battell axe
might haue b&eacute;ene to anie the most valiant warrior. Thus Haie being honored of all estates
<note place="marg">Haie is made one of the nobilitie.</note>
within certeine daies after, at a councell holden at Scone, it was ordeined, that both he and
his posteritie should be accepted amongst the number of the chiefest nobles and p&eacute;eres of the
realme, being rewarded (besides monie and other great gifts) with ilands and reuenues, such
<note place="marg">He had reuenues assigned to him.</note>
as he should choose sufficient for the maintenance of their estates.</p>
<p>It is said, that by the counsell of his sonnes, who knew the fruitfulnes of the soile, he did
aske so much ground in those parts where the riuer of Taie runs by the towne of Arrole
<note place="marg">Haie his request.</note>
ouer against Fife, as a falcon would flie ouer at one flight. Which request being freelie granted of the king, the place was appointed at Inschire for the falcon to be cast off: the which
taking hir flight from thence, neuer lighted till sh&eacute;e came to a great stone n&eacute;ere a village called
<note place="marg">The falcon mesured Haie his lands out.</note>
Rosse, not passing foure miles from Dund&eacute;e. By which meanes all that countrie which lieth
betwixt Inschire aforesaid, and the said stone (being almost six miles in length, and foure in
breadth) felt vnto Haie and his sons. The name of the stone also being called the falcons
stone to this daie, dooth cause the thing better to be bel&eacute;eued, and well n&eacute;ere all the foresaid
ground still continueth in the possession of the Haies euen vnto this day. Besides this, to the
further honoring of his name, the king gaue him armes thr&eacute;e scutchons gules in a field of siluer,
<note place="marg">Haie had armes giuen him.</note>
a plowbeame added therevnto, which he vsed in stead of a battell axe, when he fought so
valiantlie in defense of his owne countrie. Thus had the Haies their beginning of nobilitie,
whose house hath atteined vnto great estimation of honor, and hath b&eacute;ene decorated with the
office of the constableship of Scotland, by the bounteous beneuolence of kings that succ&eacute;eded.
These things happened in the first y&eacute;ere of king Kenneth.</p>
<p>In the residue of the time that he reigned, though there chanced no great businesse by forren enimies, yet by ciuill sedition the state of the realme was woonderfullie disquieted. First
a companie of Kerns of the westerne lies inuading Rosse, to the intent to haue fetched a
<note place="marg">Ciuill wars in Scotland.</note>
bootie, were met withall by the waie and ouerthrowne by the inhabitants of that countrie.
After this sturre, another followed, farre more dangerous to the whole state of the 
<note place="marg">An other commotion in Mernes by Cruthlint.</note>
commonwelth raised by one Cruthlint, one of the chiefest lords of the Mernes, who was sonne vnto a
certeine ladie named Fenella, the daughter of one Cruthneth, that was gouernor of that part
of Angus which lieth betwixt the two riuers, the one called Southeske, and the other Northeske. So it chanced, that on a time Cruthlint came vnto the castell of Delbogin to s&eacute;e his
<note place="marg">Cruthlint went to s&eacute;e his grandfather.</note>

<note place="marg">Two of his seruants were slaine.</note>
grandfather, the said Cruthneth as then lieng in the same : where vpon light occasion a fraie
was begun amongst the seruingmen, in the which two of Cruthlints seruants fortuned to be
slaine. Which iniurie when Cruthlint declared by waie of complaint vnto his grandfather, he
was so slenderlie heard, and answered in such reprochfull wise, as though he himselfe had
bin the author of the busines, so that Cruthneths seruants perceiuing how little he was regarded of their maister, fell vpon him and beat him, that not without danger of life he brake foorth
<note place="marg">They set vpon Cruthlint also.</note>
of their hands, and hardlie escaped away.</p>
<p>In his returne homewards, he came to his mother Fenella, where she lay within the castell
of Fethircarne the chiefest fortresse of all the Mernes. Where being incensed through his
<note place="marg">Cruthlint was instigated to reuenge.</note>
mothers instigation, being a woman of a furious nature, he attempted foorth with to be reuenged
of the iniurie receiued : so that assembling a number of his friends and kinsfolks so secredie
as he might togither, with a band of the inhabitants of the Mernes, he enereth into Angus,
and comming vnto the castell of Deibogin in the night season, was suffered to enter by the
<note place="marg">He killed all them that were in the castell.</note>
k&eacute;epers of the gate, nothing suspecting anie treason in the world, by reason wherof was
Cruthneth suddenlie oppressed, the house sacked and raced, not one that was found within
the same being left aliue. The spoile also was diuided by Cruthlint amongst them which came
with him. The next day likewise he forraied the countrie all there abouts, returning home
<note place="marg">The countrie is forraied.</note>
with a great bootie.</p>
<p>They of Angus prouoked herewith, rested not long; but assembling themselues togither

inuaded the countrie of Merns, where making great slaughter on each side, they left the

countrie void almost both of men and cattell. Thus did the people of those two countries
pursue the warre one against another a certeine time, with dailie incursions and wastings of
either others countries, in such cruell wise, that it was thought the one of them must n&eacute;eds
shortlie come to vtter destruction, if sp&eacute;edie remedie were not the sooner prouided. The king
<note place="marg">The king made a proclamation by an herald.</note>
being informed of this mischiefe and great trouble, which was fallen out through sedition
amongst those his subiects, h&eacute;e made proclamation by an herald, that those of Angus and

Scone, there to make answer afore appointed iudges, to such things as might be laid to their

<p>The most part of them doubting to be punished for their offenses with Cruthlint their

<note place="marg">The K. minded to punish the disobedient rebels.</note>
which had thus disobeied his commandements to be punished according to the order of the

<note place="marg">Crutblint taken with manie more.</note>
the residue of the offendors, the which at length being taken in Lochquhabir, were brought
vnto a castell in Gowrie called Dounsinnam, where after iudgement pronounced against them,
Cruthlint first, and then other the chiefest stirrers on either side were put to execution. The

<p>For this equitie shewed in ministring iustice by the king, he was greatlie praised, loued, and
<note place="marg">The K. was worthily commended for his iustice.</note>
dread of all his subiects; so that great quietnesse followed in the state of the common-wealth,
greatlie to the aduancement thereof, and so continued till the 22 y&eacute;ere of this Kenneths
reigne. At what time the blind loue he bare to his owne issue, caused him to procure a 
<note place="marg">K. Kenneth poisoned his cousin Malcolme.</note>
detestable fact, in making away one of his n&eacute;erest kinsmen. This was Malcolme the sonne of
king Duffe, created in the beginning of Kenneths reigne prince of Cumberland, by reason
wherof he ought to haue succ&eacute;eded in ruie of the kingdome after Kenneths death. Whereat
the same Kenneth gr&eacute;euing not a little, for that thereby his sonnes should be kept from inioieng the crowne, found meanes to poison him. But though the physicians vnderstanding
<note place="marg">The K. was not suspected of this fact.</note>
by such euident signes as appeared in his bodie, that he was poisoned ind&eacute;ed, yet such was
the opinion which men had of the kings honor and integritie, that no suspicion at all was conceiued that it should be his deed.</p>
<p>The cloked loue also which he had shewed toward him at all times, and so sudden commandement giuen by him vpon the first newes of his death, that his funerais should be 
<note place="marg">The poisoning of Malcolme is brought into suspicion.</note>
celebrated in euerie church and chappell for his soule; and againe, the teares which he shed for
him, in all places where anie mention chanced to be made of the losse which the realme had
susteined by the death of so worthie a prince, made men nothing mistrustfull of the matter,
till at length some of the nobles perceiuing the outward sorow (which he made) to passe the
true griefe of the heart, began to gather some suspicion, that all was not well: but yet bicause
no certeintie appeared, they kept their thoughts to themselues. About the same time came
<note place="marg">Ambassadors came from K. Edward.</note>
ambassadors foorth of England from king Edward the sonne of Edgar (which after through
treason of his stepmother Essuclda, was made a martryr) requiring that sith Malcolme the prince
of Cumberland was deceassed, it might please the king with the states of the realme to choose
some other in his place, who dooing his homage vnto the king of England, according as it
<note place="marg">He required a new prince to be elected.</note>
was couenanted by the league, might be a meane to confirme the same league betwixt
the two nations for the auoiding of all occasions of breach thereof that otherwise happilie might
insue.</p>
<p>Kenneth at the same time held a councell at Scone, where hauing heard the requ&egrave;st of these.
<note place="marg">The K. heard a fit message for his purpose.</note>

ambassadors, in presence of all his nobles, he answered that he was glad to vnderstand that
king Edward was so carefull for maintenance of loue and amitie betwixt his subiects and the
Scotishmen, according to the articles of the ancient league in times past concluded betwixt
them, the ratification whereof for his part he likewise most earnestlie desired, and therefore in
rendering most heartie thanks vnto him for his gentle aduertisement, he purposed by the aduise of his nobles, and the other estates of his realme as then there assembled, to elect a new
prince of Cumberland, without anie further delaie; and therevpon required the ambassador
to be present on the morrow, to heare what he was whom the nobles should name to be preferred vnto that dignitie. The ambassadors herevpon departing foorth of the councell chamber, were conueied to their lodging by diuerse of the nobilitie that were appointed to k&eacute;epe
them companie.</p>
<p>Then Kenneth with a long oration went about to persuade the p&eacute;eres, and other the estates
<note place="marg">The king requested that the crowne might come by inheritance.</note>
of the realme there (as I said) assembled, to alter the custome and ancient order vsed by their
elders in choosing of him that should succ&eacute;ed in the gouernance of the realme, after the deceasse of him that was in possession. He vsed so manie reasons as was possible for him to deuise in that behalfe, thereby to induce them to his purpose, which was-to haue an act established for the crowne to go by succession, onelie to this end, that one of his sonnes might inioy the
<note place="marg">A fit oration for his purpose.</note>
same immediatlie after his deceasse. He declared also what discommodities, seditions, and
great inconueniences had growne, in that the crowne had gone in times past by election: for
though it was ordeined at the first that it should so doo, vpon a good intent and great 
<note place="marg">He had roome inough to walke in, to gather proofes &amp; reasons to persuade this matter, it being good of it selfe.</note>
consideration, yet in processe of time proofe and experience had shewed, that more hinderance happened vnto the common-wealth thereby (beside the danger euer insuing incidentlie vnto such
issue as the king left behind him) than profit, if the sundrie murthers, occasions of ciuill discord, and other wicked practises were throughlie weied and considered, the summe whereof
he recited from point to point, and so in the end with great instance besought them, that so
pernicious a custome might be abolished and taken away, to the great benefit of the whole
state of the realme, speciallie sith in all realmes commonlie the order was, that the sonne should
without anie contradiction succ&eacute;ed the father in the heritage of the crowne and kinglie estate.</p>
<p>The king had no sooner made an end of his long oration, which he handled after the
<note place="marg">The peeres of the realme did willinglie grant to his request.</note>
pithiest sort h&eacute;e could, but that diuerse of the noble men which were there amongst other,
being made priuie to the matter aforehand, motioned meanes to haue Malcolme the son of
Kenneth created prince of Cumberland, that he might so haue an entrance to the crowne after
the deceasse of his father. This motion by and by was in manie of their mouthes, which Kenneth perceiuing, he required of the most ancient peeres whome they would name to be prince
of Cumberland, that there might be a meane to ratifie and confirme the league betwixt the
Scots and Englishmen, Constantine the sonne of king Cullin, and Grime the nephue of king
Duffe by his brother Mogall: howbeit by the force of the former law they might by good reason haue looked to haue had the preferment themselues.</p>
<p>But yet perceiuing it was in vaine to denie that which would be had by violence (although
<note place="marg">The herald required C&omacr;stantine his voice first.</note>

<note place="marg">Constantine his saieng.</note>
they should neuer so much stand against it) being first demanded of the herald what they
thought, they answerd (notwithstanding against their minds ind&eacute;ed) that the king might order
all things as should stand with his pleasure, appointing whom he thought most m&eacute;et to b&eacute;e
prince of Cumberland, and to abrogate the ancient law of creating the kings, in deuising new
ordinances for the same, as should s&eacute;eme vnto him and those of his councell most requisite and
necessarie. The multitude then following their sentence, cried with lowd and vndiscr&eacute;et
<note place="marg">The multitude wel pleased, crie Malcolme.</note>
voices, to haue Malcolme the sonne of king Kenneth created prince of Cumberland. And
thus the same Malcolme (though as yet vnder age) was by the voices of the people ordeined
prince of Cumberland, in place of the other Malcolme sonne to king Duffe. The daie next
following, the ambassadors comming into the councell chamber, heard what was decr&eacute;ed
touching their request, and then being highlie rewarded of the kings bountious liberalitie, they
returned into England, and Malcolme with them, to be acquainted with king Edward, and to
doo his homage for the principalitie of Cumberland, as the custome was.</p>

<p>At the same time also there was a new act deuised and made, the old being abrogated (by
<note place="marg">A new act for the succession of the crowne.</note>
the appointment of the king) for the creation of the Scotish kings in time to come, manie of
the nobles rather consenting with silence, than greatlie allowing it either in harts or voices,
though some currifauours among them set forward the matter to the best of their powers.
The articles of this ordinance were these. The eldest heire male of the deceassed king, 
<note place="marg">Articles concluded in that parlement.</note>
whether the same were sonne or nephue, of what age soeuer he should be, yea though he should be
in the mothers wombe at the time of the fathers deceasse, should from thence-foorth succ&eacute;ed in
the kingdome of Scotland. The nephue by the sonne should be preferred before the nephue by
the daughter, in atteining to the heritage of the crowne. And likewise the brothers sonne should
be admitted before the sisters son. The same law should be obserued of all such of the Scotish
nation, as had anie lands or inheritance comming to them by descent. Where the king by this
meanes chanced to be vnder age, &amp; not able to rule, there shuld be one of the chiefest
p&eacute;eres of the realme chosen and elected to haue the gouernance of his person and realme,
till he came to 14 y&eacute;eres of age. The which foureteenth y&eacute;ere of his age being accomplished, he should haue the administration committed to his owne hands. The heires of all other
persons of ech estate and degr&eacute;e should remaine vnder the wardship of their appointed gonernors, till they came to the age of 21 y&eacute;eres, and not till then to meddle with anie part of
their lands and liuings.</p>
<p>These lawes and ordinances being once published and confirmed, king Kenneth supposed
<note place="marg">King Kenneth ministred iustice trulie.</note>

<note place="marg">The good will of the nobilitie he bought with gifts.</note>
the kingdome to be fullie assured vnto him and his posteritie, and therevpon indeuored himselfe to win the harts of the people with vpright administration of iustice, and the fauour of the
nobles he sought to purchase with great gifts which he bestowed amongst them, aswell in lands
belonging to the crowne, as in other things greatlie to their contentation. Thus might he s&eacute;eme
happie to all men, hauing the loue both of his lords and commons: but yet to himselfe he s&eacute;emed
<note place="marg">The king had a gilrie conscience.</note>
most vnhappie, as he that could not but still liuein continuall feare, least his wicked practise concerning the death of Malcolme Duffe should come to light and knowledge of the world. For
so commeth it to passe, that such as are pricked in conscience for anie secret offense committed,
haue euer an vnquiet mind. And (as the fame goeth) it chanced that a voice was heard as he
<note place="marg">A voice heard by the king.</note>
was in bed in the night time to take his rest, vttering vnto him these or the like woords in effect: "Thinke not Kenneth that the wicked slaughter of Malcolme Duffe by thee contriued,
is kept secret from the knowledge of the eternall God: thou art he that didst conspire the innocents death, enterprising by traitorous meanes to doo that to thy neighbour, which thou
wouldest haue reuenged by cruell punishment in anie of thy subiects, if it had beene offered to
thy selfe. It shall therefore come to passe, that both thou thy selfe, and thy issue, through
the iust vengeance of almightie God, shall suffer woorthie punishment, to the infamie of thy
house and familie for euermore. For euen at this present are there in hand secret practises to
dispatch both th&eacute;e and thy issue out of the waie, that other maie inioy this kingdome which
thou doost indeuour to assure vnto thine issue."</p>
<p>The king with this voice being striken into great dread and terror, passed that night without
anie sleepe comming in his eies. Wherefore in the morning he got him vnto bishop Mouean, a
<note place="marg">The king confesseth his sinnes.</note>
man of great holinesse of life, vnto whome he confessed his heinous and most wicked offense,
bes&eacute;eching him of counsell, which waie he might obteine pardon and forgiuenes at Gods hands
by woorthie penance. Mouean hearing how the king bemoned his offense committed, he
willed him to be of good comfort. For as the wrath of almightie God was prouoked by
sinne and wicked offenses, so was the same pacified againe by repentance, if so be we continue
penitent and willing to amend. King Kenneth being confirmed in hope of forgiuenesse by
<note place="marg">The king taketh great repentance.</note>
these and sundrie other the like comfortable woords of the hishop, studied vnfeinedlie to doo
woorthie penance, leauing nothing vndone which he thought might serue for a witnesse of his

him, by reason of his heinous and wicked crime.</p>
<p>It chanced h&eacute;erevpon, that within a short time after he had beene at Fordune, a towne in

to lodge at the castell of Fethircarne, where as then there was a forrest full of all manner of
<note place="marg">A parke with wild beasts at the castell of Fethircarne.</note>
wild beasts that were to be had in anie part of Albion. Here was he receiued by Fenella ladie
of the house, whose son (as ye haue he&amacr;rd) he caused to be put to death, for the commotion
made betwixt them of Mernes and Angus. She was also of kin vnto Malcolme Duffe, whome
<note place="marg">Fenella was of kin vnto Malcolme.</note>
the king had made awaie, and in like manner vnto Constantine and Grime, defrauded of their
right to the crowne, by the craftie deuise of the king (as before is partlie mentioned.) This woman therefore being of a stout stomach, longtime before hauing conceiued an immortall grudge
towards the king, vpon the occasions before rehearsed (namelie aswell for the death of hir
sonne Cruthlint, as hauing some inkling also of the impoisoning of Malcolme Duffe, though
<note place="marg">She was desirous for to reuenge.</note>
no full certeintie therof was knowne) imagined night and day how to be reuenged.</p>
<p>She vnderstood that the king delighted aboue measure in goodlie buildings, and therefore
to the end to compasse hir malicious intent, she had caused a tower to be made, ioining vnto
<note place="marg">Fenella hir malicious intent.</note>
hir owne lodging within the foresaid castell of Fethircarne. The which tower was couered
ouer with copper finelie ingrauen with diuerse flowers and images. H&eacute;ereto was it hoong
within with rich cloths of arras wrought with gold and silke, verie faire and costlie. Behind
the same were there crossebowes set readie bent with sharpe quarrels in them. In the middest
<note place="marg">Crossebowes readie bent, hidden.</note>
of the house there was a goodlie brasen image also, resembling the figure of king Kenneth,
holding in the one hand a faire golden apple set full of pretious stones, deuised with such art
and cunning, that so soone as anie man should draw the same vnto him, or remooue it neuer
so little anie waie foorth, the crossebowes would immediatlie discharge their quarrels vpon him
with great force and violence.</p>
<p>Fenella therefore being thus prouided aforehand, after meate desired the king to go with hir
<note place="marg">Fenella had the king into the inner chamber.</note>
into that inner chamber, into the which being entered, he could not be satisfied of long with
the beholding of the goodlie furniture, aswell of the hangings as of diuerse other things. At
the last hauing viewed the image which stood (as is said) in the midst of the chamber, he
demanded what the same did signifie ? Fenella answered, how that image did represent his
person, and the golden apple set so richlie with smaragds, iacincts, saphires, topases, rubies, turkasses, and such like pretious stones, she had prouided as a gift for him, and therefore required
him to take the same, bes&eacute;eching him to accept it in good part, though it were not in value
woorthie to be offered vnto his princelie honor and high dignitie. And h&eacute;erewith she hirselfe
withdrew aside, as though she would haue taken some thing foorth of a chest or coffer, thereby to auoid the danger.</p>
<p>But the king delighted in beholding the gems and orient stones, at length remoouing the
<note place="marg">The king was slaine with the crosse bowes.</note>
apple, the better to aduise it, incontinentlie the crossebowes discharged their quarrels so directlie vpon him, that striking him through in sundrie places, he fell downe starke dead, and lay
flat on the ground. Fenella as soone as she beheld him fall to the ground readie to die, she
<note place="marg">Fenella escaped from them all.</note>
gotfoorth by a backe doore into the next woods, where she had appointed horsses to tarie for hir,
by meanes whereof she escaped out of all danger of them that pursued hir, yer the death of the
king were openlie knowne vnto them. His seruants still waiting for his comming foorth in

the vtter chamber, at length when they saw he came not at all, first they knocked at the doore
softlie, then they rapped hard thereat: lastlie, doubting that which had happened, they brake
open doore after doore, till at length they came into the chamber where the king lay cold dead
vpon the floore.</p>
<p>The clamor and crie h&eacute;erevpon was raised by his seruants, and Fenella curssed and sought
<note place="marg">Fenella could not be found.</note>
for in euerie place, that had committed so heinous and wicked a d&eacute;ed: but the vngratious woman was conueied so secretlie out of the waie, that no where could she be heard of. Some
supposed that she fled first vnto Constantine, by whose helpe she got ouer into Ireland. The

<note place="marg">Constantine aspired vnto the crowne.</note>
ambitious desire which the same Constantine shewed he had to succeed in gouernment of the

was known that Kenneth was dead, he got his friends togither, and went vnto diuerse places
requiring the lords to assist him in atteing to the crowne, which by the old ordinance and

died so generallie, that if there had not beene more plentie of fish got than was accustomed
to be, the people had b&eacute;ene famished in manie places. In Albion and also France it rained
stones. But all these dreadfull woonders might not withdraw the Scotishmen from their
wicked vices, wherevnto in those daies they were wholie giuen, though there wanted not
diuerse vertuous men, as well bishops as other, that in their sermons exhorted the people
to repent and amend their naughtie liuings: for otherwise vndoubtedlie such grislie sights
and tokens as chanced in those daies, menaced some great mischiefe to fall vnto the whole
nation. And suerlie their woords proued true: for the Scots continuing in their wilfulnesse,
being stubborne harted one against another, brought their countrie into danger of vtter

of Cumberland, hearing that Constantine (against the ordinance latelie made) had vsurped
the crowne, as soone as his fathers bodie was buried in Colmekill, with such funerall pompe
as apperteined, he desired his fathers friends to giue him such faithfull counsell as they
thought most expedient, which way he were best to woorke for the appeasing of the sedition
now begun, by reason of Constantines presumptuous attempt. There were some amongest
<note place="marg">Good counsell was giuen him.</note>
that companie that tooke it to be best, first to vnderstand the minds of all the p&eacute;eres and
nobles of the realme, before they went about anie exploit against the tyrant; least whilest
Malcolme should s&eacute;eke to deliuer himselfe from danger, he might happilie wind himselfe
further into trouble, than without extreame perill of the common-wealth he should be able
to get foorth thereof againe. Other there were that iudged it best suddenlie to go against
<note place="marg">Yet other counsell was giuen him.</note>
Constantine before he made himselfe strong: for if they came vpon him yer he were prouided for their comming, manie of them that feigned themselues to be his friends, would
forsake him, so soone as they saw anie power of his enimies at hand. And then should
he either fall into their hands, or be driuen to fl&eacute;e the realme for safegard of his life.</p>
<p>The fierce yoong man following this counsell as the best to his seeming, &amp; trusting
more to his owne wit than to the graue aduise of men of skill, assembled togither in all

and puissance, caused Malcolme for verie feare that he should not be able in anie part to

he had b&eacute;ene put to such hinderance and dishonor, as would not easilie haue b&eacute;ene recouered, had not Kenneth the bastard sonne of his father the aboue mentioned Kenneth
incamped with a mightic power about Sterling, &amp; defended the passages of the Forth, that
Constantine with his armie could not come ouer. Then rose there a great famine and

penurie of vittels in both hosts, so that Constantine with great indignation was constreined
to breake vp his campe, and so to leaue his enterprise for that season.</p>
<p>Thus was the realme diuided into two sundrie factions, wherevpon followed wastings and
incursions made into each others possessions, with such crueltie, that the same might be a sufficient instruction what mischiefe happeneth through ciuill discord. The poore commons
and husbandmen were brought to such miserie through the often spoilings and robberies
vsed by the men of warre, that they were not able to till their grounds. Finallie, there
rose one mischiefe so fast in the necke of an other, that no kind of crueltie was spared,
robbing, reauing, and forcible extortion was exercised on all sides without hope of anie
redresse or amendment. Whilest the Scotishmen were thus at diuision amongest themselues,
<note place="marg">King Edward, or rather Ethelred, purchased peace of the Danes.</note>
renting and pulling in p&eacute;eces their owne miserable natiue countrie, Edward king of England
being oppressed with inuasion of Danes, was glad to buie peace at their hands, for himselfe
and his people, with right large summes of monie; but perceiuing that his enimies ceassed
not dailie to spoile and rob his subiects, he purposed to trie what he might doo by making
<note place="marg">Malcolme is readie to helpe king Edward against the Danes.</note>
them warre: and to make his part the stronger, he required Malcolme prince of Cumberland
to aid him against the Danes, according to the couenant of the ancient ieague. Malcolme
consenting to K. Edwards request, came with a mightie armie of Cumberland men to support him: by reason whereof the Danes doubting to be ouermatched, after certeine light
<note place="marg">King Edward made peace with the Danes.</note>
skirmishes, without anie great bloudshed, condescended to haue peace, which was concluded with these conditions: that king Edward should paie vnto the Danes a thousand
pounds of gold, for the which they should content themselues with those lands which they
had alredie in possession, and to inuade no further vpon the Englishmen; but contrariwise
to be readie to fight in their defense, if anie forreine enimie sought to make anie warres
vpon them. In the meane time, whilest Malcolme was thus in England occupied in aid of
king Edward against the Danes, king Constantine thought the time to serue verie well for
his purpose, to reduce all those regions of Scotland, which tooke part with his aduersarie
(the foresaid Malcolme) vnder his subiection.</p>
<p>He assembled therefore twentie thousand men, and comming into Louthian, heard how
<note place="marg">King Constantine renued warre with Malcolme.</note>
Kenneth the bastard aforesaid (being left by his brother Malcolme to resist Constantines
attempts) thad got togither an huge armie of his brothers friends, and was come vnto Crawmond, where the riuer falleth into the Forth, thr&eacute;e miles from Edenburgh, purposing there
to abide his enimies, if they minded to assaile him. Constantine herevpon hasted 
<note place="marg">Constantine ioined battell with Kenneth the bastard.</note>
thitherwards, and comming within sight of his enimies, strightwaies ioined battell with them;
immediatlie wherewith there rose such an outragious tempest of wind, comming out of the
east, &amp; driuing the sand in the faces of Constantines men, that they were not able to s&eacute;e
about them to make anie defense against their enimies that then preassed vpon them right
eagerlie. By means whereof the discomfiture lighted vpon Constantines side, though neither part had anie great cause to reioise: for in the hotest of the fight, Constantine and
Kenneth chanced to incounter togither, and so fighting man to man, either siue other. Thus
<note place="marg">King Constantine is slaine.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1002.</date></note>
Constantine ended his life by dint of the enimies sword, in the third yeare of his reigne, &amp;

<note place="marg">Grime vsed liberalitie and gentlenesse towards Constantines friends.</note>
old laws and ordinances of the realme. And to establish himselfe the more firmelie in the
state, he shewed great gentlenesse towards all them that were friends vnto Constantine, and

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"251"</fw>-->

bestowed vpon them manie bountious gifts. Neither was his liberalitie shut vp from other
that had fauored Malcolme, for to the end he might allure them to beare him good will, he
rewarded them highlie both in lands and treasure: but other of the same faction, whome
he saw by no means could be woone, he caused them to be proclamed traitors, and confiscated their goods as rebels to his person, and enimies to the crowne.</p>
<p>Malcolme prince of Cumberland sore mooued in his mind that Grime had thus taken vpon
<note place="marg">Malcolme prince of Cumberland is mooued against Grime.</note>

<note place="marg">A good counsell.</note>

<note place="marg">Malcolme sendeth priuilie to the lords of Scotland.</note>
him the crowne, called his friends togither, requiring to haue their aduise, which way he
were best to woorke in this so great a matter. They counselled him in no wise he should
despise the force of his enimies, but rather to assaie by all means to draw those nobles vnto
his purpose, which were assistant vnto Grime. Wherevpon Malcolme following the counsell of his friends, sent foorth secret messengers vnto those lords that tooke part with Grime,
requiring them to remember their promised faith, giuen vnto his father king Kenneth, concerning the obseruance of the law established by their consent for the succession of their
kings: which if they would doo in renouncing their obeisance vnto the vsurper Grime, he
promised so to gouerne the realme with equall iustice, that no estate in reason should find
<note place="marg">Malcolme his promise vnto the Scots.</note>

<note place="marg">Malcolme his messengers are committed to prison.</note>
cause to mislike with his dooings. Manie of the nobles by means of this message reuolted
from the said Grime soliciting their friends by earnest trauell to doo the like. But other &amp;
the greater number tooke those that brought the message, &amp; sent them as prisoners vnto
Grime, who presentlie committed them to prison.</p>
<p>Malcolme sore offended therewith, by counsell of his friends, assembled an armie to go
<note place="marg">Malcolme being offended therewith, gathered an armie.</note>

<note place="marg">Grime is of greater force than Malcolme.</note>

<note place="marg">Malcolme would not haue his people to vnderstand the trueth thereof.</note>
against them, that (contrarie to the law of all nations, as he seemed to take the matter) had
imprisoned his purseuants and messengers: but as he was marching forward on his purposed iournie, he heard by the way, how his aduersarie king Grime had gathered a farre
greater power than he had with him, not onelie of all such of the Scotish nation inhabiting
beyond the riuers of Forth and Clide, but of them also of the westerne Iles. Malcolme
doubting least if the certeintie hereof were once bruted amongest his people, the fame
would increase the terror more than n&eacute;eded; he gaue commandement therfore that no
maner of wight should be suffered to come into his armie, vnlesse he were first brought to
his presence. But this deuise nothing auailed him: for thereby, that which he desired to
<note place="marg">His aduise auailed not.</note>
be concealed and kept most secret, became the more manifest, by reason that such as had
some inkeling of the matter, told it from one to another; making it much more than it was
in d&eacute;ed. For there rose a murmuring amongest them, that there was such treason contriued, that if Malcolme with his armie went forward to ioine with his aduersaries, he should
<note place="marg">A brute spred in Malcolmes armie of treason.</note>
not be in danger onelie of them, which he knew to come against him in Grimes host; but
also of no small number of them which were in his owne armie, who vpon the ioining had
determined to turne their speare points against him in Grimes quarell.</p>
<p>This rumor passing from one to another, put the whole number in great feare. It was
<note place="marg">Merchantmen authors of the rumor.</note>
first raised by certeine merchantmen, of whome there was a great number in Malcolms
host, hauing more skill in buieng and selling, than in anie warlike feats or enterprises.
These at the first s&ugrave;ing for licence to depart home, and could haue no grant, began to lament their miseries, in such dolefull wise, that all the campe was troubled with the noise;
insomuch that euen the old men of warre, and diuerse of the capteins were not a little discomfited and amazed with such wailefull clamors. Malcolme being aduertised hereof,
thought not good to match in battell against his fierce enimies with his people thus astonied
<note place="marg">Malcolme licenceth the most part of his armie to depart hence.</note>

<note place="marg">Malcolme intendeth to stop his enimie from passing ouer the Forth.</note>

for that time, and aboad onelie with certeine bands of his most faithfull friends n&eacute;ere to
the water of Forth, to stop his enimies from passing ouer that riuer.</p>
<p>Whilest the realme of Scotland was thus disquieted and troubled with ciuill discord,
Fothadus the great bishop of Scotland, a man of right approued vertue and clemencie, sore
lamenting to s&eacute;e his countrie thus diuided and rent as it were in p&eacute;eces, got him into his
pontificall vestures, with a multitude of other reuerend priests and ecclesiasticall ministers,
in humble wise comming and presenting themselues before king Grime, who with great

<!--<fw place="top-left">"252"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

reuerence receiuing them, willed to vnderstand the cause of their comming. Then Fothadus
<note place="marg">Fothadus s&eacute;eketh to take vp the matter.</note>
answered, that he was come as the seruant of Christ, the author of all peace and concord,
bes&eacute;eching him by way of humble supplication to take ruth and pitie of the great trouble
and miserie fallen to the realme, since the time he had taken the gouernance vpon him,
the state of things being such, as if some redresse were not found in all speedie wise, the
vtter ruine of the common-wealth must needs insue, by reason of the sundrie debats and
factions dailie rising among the people of all sorts and degrees, so that murthers, robberies,
<note place="marg">The fruits of ciuill warre.</note>
rapes, with all other kinds of iniuries &amp; mischiefe were still put in practise without restreint
or punishment, in such licentious sort that no man could assure himselfe of his owne; for
whether it were within doores, or without, the robber was as redie to laie hands on it as
the owner. Neither was there anie hope of reformation so long as the ciuill wars lasted.
Therefore if it might stand with the pleasure of king Grime in reliefe of the poore commons of Scotland, to condescend vnto some necessarie agreement with Malcolme, Fothadus
<note place="marg">Fothadus vndertaketh to conclude a peace betwixt the parties.</note>
offered to vndertake to conclude a peace betwixt them, in such wise as should in no maner
of behalfe be preiudiciall to his honor and roiall maiestie.</p>
<p>Grime mooued with the words of the bishop (who most instantlie besought him, although
the calamitie and great affliction of his people did but little mollifie his heart; yet in respect of his owne suertie, which might not continue if his people were once destroied, to
remit part of his high displeasure) answered, that peace he could be contented to haue,
<note place="marg">Grimes answere to Fothadus.</note>
so the same might be concluded with his honor saued: for suerlie wars he neuer desired
but onelie in defense of his good title and right, which he had to the crowne descended
vnto him by the old lawes and ancient ordinances of the realme, and therefore he purposed
not to leaue the same with life, but to fight for it against Malcolme, and all his partakers,
euen vnto death. But if it were so, that Malcoime would content himselfe with the principalitie of Cumberland, and so therevpon breake vp his campe, and depart foorth of the lands
perteining vnto the crowne, he would gladlie come to a communication with him for peace;
but if Malcolme refused thus to doo, he assured him that he would not leaue off to pursue
him to the vttermost of his power, as his most cruell and fierce enimie.</p>
<p>Fothadus hauing heard Grimes words, besought him to staie a time, till he might go
vnto Malcolme, to vnderstand what his full mind was in this behalfe, not doubting but to
find him conformable vnto anie reasonable motion, for relieuing of the poore afflicted state
of the land. Grime granting vnto this request, Fothadus in like sort and habit as he
<note place="marg">Fothadus goeth vnto Malcolme.</note>
came vnto Grime, went vnto Malcolme, whome he found at Sterling; where comming
before his presence with a long oration, he greatlie bewailed the dolorous calamities of the
Scotish common-wealth, into the which it was fallen through ciuill sedition onlie, and herewith declared also by great likeliehood of substantiall reasons, how infortunat and miserable
the end should be of the warres, if the same were pursued to the vttermost. His tale being
throughlie heard and well digested, wrought so with Malcolme, that he promised to 
<note place="marg">Malcolms offer.</note>
withdraw into Cumberland without anie further attempt, if Grime would in like case breake vp
his campe, and agr&eacute;e to haue a truce for three moneths space, in which meane time they
might by certeine commissioners appointed and authorised thereto, talke and common for
concluding of a finall peace and concord betwixt them.</p>
<p>Grime refused not this offer, and so therevpon licenced his people to depart to their
<note place="marg">Grime is contented with Malcolms motion.</note>
homes, repairing himselfe with certeine of his nobles into Angus vnto the castell of Forfair,
there to take further aduise what was to be doone touching the appointed communication of
peace. But Fothadus would in no wise rest, till the commissioners were met and assembled
<note place="marg">Fothadus his diligence to procure the parties to agr&eacute;ement.</note>

<note place="marg">The conditions of the peace betwixt Grime and Malcolme.</note>
togither in communication at Scone, where within few daies after (chieflie through his
earnest diligence) peace was concluded with these conditions. First, that Grime during his
life time should inioy the crowne, and after his deceasse the same to remaine to Malcolme
&amp; his heirs by lineall descent for euer, according to the ordinance &amp; decr&eacute;e made &amp; established by K. Kenneth. And whosoeuer should go about either by word or d&eacute;ed to impeach or hinder the said ordinance and decr&eacute;e, should be reputed for a traitor to the 

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"mon-"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"253"</fw>-->

common-wealth &amp; realme. Furthermore all the lands lieng betwixt Louthian &amp; Northumberland, and betwixt Clide and Westmerland, euen from the Almaine seas to the Irish seas,
should presentlie remaine &amp; be transported vnto the dominion &amp; gouernement of Malcolme, with the which contenting himselfe, during the naturall life of Grime, he should continue in friendship with the said Grime, &amp; so in no wise stirre or moue anie warre or debate, either against him or anie of his friends: for if he did, and went about to breake anie
of the articles of this peace, he should not onelie lose those lands which he now held, but
also be depriued of all the right, title, claime, and interest which either he or his posteritie
might make or pretend vnto the crowne at anie time hereafter.</p>
<p>When both the princes had bound themselues by solemne othes to performe euerie point
<note place="marg">The warres being ceassed, the princes applie their studies to reforme misdemeanors.</note>
and points in these articles comprised, they laid armor aside, and began to take order for
reforming of all misdemeanours, which had happened within the land, by reason of the
ciuill contention mooued betwixt them and their partakers. Howbeit, commandement was
giuen by either of these princes, that their subiects should be still in &aacute; readinesse with
armour and weapons (if need required) to defend themselues against all sudden inuasions
of their neighbours, whereby it may be gathered, that the one had the other still in some
mistrust, what countenance soeuer they shewed outwardlie. Yet notwithstanding, for the
space of 8 yeares togither, the peace continued without breach, or any notable trouble betwixt them.</p>
<p>But Grime at length of a chast &amp; liberall prince, through long slouth and increase of
<note place="marg">King Grime his alteration from noble qualities vnto detestable vices.</note>
riches, became a most couetous tyrant, and so corrupted in maners and conditions, that it
passed the bounds of all reason and equitie: insomuch that when he had put vnto death
diuerse of his nobles, to the end he might haue their lands and goods as forfeited by atteindor, he oppressed the people by continuall exactions also each day more than other.
His subiects being thus brought into extreame miserie through his wicked and vniust 
<note place="marg">The common peoples praier.</note>
gouernement, not knowing where to s&eacute;eke for redresse, saue onelie at the hands of almightie
God, the punisher of all sinne, besought him to haue pitie of their afflictions and miseries,
and to change the gouernment of the realme into some better state. The lords also hauing
<note place="marg">The lords require Grime to reforme the misdemeanor of his officers.</note>
great indignation of the trouble fallen to the realme, by the kings misgouernance and auaricious crueltie, appointed a certeine number of gentlemen to go vnto him as ambassadors
from them, to require him to put awaie from him such naughtie persons as by euill counsell
had peruerted his mind, &amp; mooued him to doo things contrarie to his honor, and the wealth
of his realme.</p>
<p>One of these ambassadors (to whome the charge was giuen) had the words in name of
them all, who comming before the kings presence, declared to him that they were sent from
the residue of the nobles and p&eacute;eres of his realme, to admonish him of things perteining
to the suertie of his estate, and common wealth of his dominions: which was, that whereas
through persuasion of euill councellors he suffered manie enormities to be committed by his
ministers and officers against his subiects, to their vtter impouerishment and vndooing, the
rebuke whereof did redound vnto his dishonour; if it would please him to remooue out of
his presence and seruice all such disloiall persons as sought the hinderance of the commonwealth, he should win therby the loue of all his liege subiects, which now could not but
grudge and repine at this his gouernement, as men by the same brought into such calamitie,
that better it were for them in their iudgements to be dead than aliue, if reformation were
not the sooner had against such extortions as his seruants and officers did dailie practise, and
for the which no doubt he must n&eacute;eds answer, sith the sword was committed vnto him, not
<note place="marg">The office of the sword.</note>
to inrich couetous persons, nor to oppresse innocent and true dealing people, but contrarilie
to punish and correct guiltie and vniust dealers.</p>
<p>When king Grime had heard what message these ambassadors had brought, he answered
to the same with fained words, and willed them vnder the pretext of courtesie to a banket,
in purpose to haue put them all in prison: but they being aduertised thereof got them in
<note place="marg">King Grime purposed to haue slaine the messengers.</note>
all hast to their horsses, and fled forthwith vnto Bertha, where the residue of the nobles at

the same time were assembled. Grime hauing thus no regard to the wholesome aduertisement of his nobles, thought that all things would come forward with such felicitie and
hap as he wished, not ceassing from raising new paiments and exactions still of his subiects,
till at length he was aduertised how his nobles had raised open warre against him, at
<note place="marg">The lords of Scotland arrere warre against Grime their king.</note>

<note place="marg">What mischief insued.</note>
which newes being sore kindled with displeasure, he got togither a great number of men,
and marched foorth towards them that had so rebelled against him. Then followed more
mischeef and trouble than euer had b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene afore that time in Scotland: for by reason
of this ciuill dissention, castels were raced and ouerthrowne, townes burned vp, corne destroied, fields wasted, and the people slaine in all places, yea as well in churches as elsewhere.</p>
<p>Malcolme prince of Cumberland hearing of such cruell wars as were thus raised in Scotland betwixt the king and the nobles of the realme, to the danger of the vtter euersion of
the whole common-wealth, returned with all sp&eacute;ed foorth of England (where he was with
an armie as then in aid of king Egeldred against the Danes) into his owne countrie for
defense of his subiects, if anie attempt should happilie be made against them in that troublesome season. Howbeit, he was no sooner returned home, but the nobles of Louthian came
<note place="marg">Malcolme is required to relieue the Scotish estate.</note>
vnto him, beseeching him to take pitie vpon his miserable and torne countrie, &amp; to imploie
his whole force to remooue away from the people such imminent destruction as dailie hasted
towards them, which to doo they thought it was partlie euen his dutie, sith God had bestowed vpon him such gifts, both of bodie, mind, and fortune, as most plentiouslie appeared in him, not onelie for the weale of himselfe, but also of his friends &amp; countrie, &amp;
therefore his part was to shew his earnest diligence to deliuer the common-wealth of such
tyrannie as was practised by the misgouernement of Grime and his vnhappie councellors.
Which being done, he might order all things as should like him best.</p>
<p>Malcolme mooued with these and the like persuasions of the Scotish lords, which dailie
<note place="marg">Malcolme consenteth to make warres against Grime.</note>
resorted vnto him, resolued with promise of their support to leuie warre against Grime in
this so necessarie a quarell, and so assembling a great puissance togither, he did set foorth
towards his aduersarie. By the way also there came still vnto him great numbers of men
from each side to aid him in this enterprise, offering by solemne othes to become his liegemen and subiects. Grime likewise being aduertised of those newes, with all sp&eacute;ed got 
<note place="marg">Grime assembleth an armie to incounter Malcolme.</note>

<note place="marg">The camps n&eacute;ere the one to the other.</note>

<note place="marg">Grimes policie.</note>
togither such people as hee might assemble for the time, and comming forward with the same
at the towne of Auchnabart, both the armies pitched downe their tents, the one fast by the
other, on the Ascension daie. Here Grime supposing that he might take his enimies at
some aduantage, if he came vpon them on the sudden, for that being giuen to deuotion,
they would looke for nothing lesse than for battell on that daie, he got foorth of his campe
in the dawning of that morning, in purpose foorthwith to assaile them.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, Malcolme being aduertised thereof, sent vnto Grime, requesting him
<note place="marg">Malcolmes request.</note>
to desist from battell for reuerence of that blessed feast, but Grime would in no wise assent
thereto, but n&eacute;edes would come on without stop or staie; whervpon both the armies rushing togither met right fiercelie, so that in the beginning there was great slaughter made on
<note place="marg">The battell betwixt Grime and Malcolme.</note>

<note place="marg">Grimes part discomfited.</note>

<note place="marg">The end of king Grime.</note>
both sides, but within a while king Grimes side was put to the woorsse, and in the end
clearelie discomfited. In the chase were manie slaine, but yet no such number as so notable a victorie required. It is said that Grime was taken aliue standing at defense, &amp; most
fiercelie fighting, who being sore wounded in the head, had both his eies put out, and afterwards continuing so in great miserie and languor certeine daies, at length departed out of
this life, in the 9 y&eacute;ere of his reigne, and was buried in Colmekill, after the incarnation 1010

<note place="marg">1004. <emph>Io.M.</emph></note>

<p>After this victorie thus obteined by Malcolme, he called such noble men as were taken
<note place="marg">Malcolmes words to them that were taken prisoners.</note>
prisoners in this battell before him, vsing manie gentle woords toward them, declaring that
the right of the crowne apperteined vnto him, and that the warres which h&eacute;e had made,
were not attempted against the common wealth of the Scotish estate, but rather in reliefe
thereof, to the end the people might be deliuered of the tyrannie exercised by Grime and

his councellors. When he had thus vttered his mind vnto them, he appointed a publike
<note place="marg">A parlement at Scone.</note>
assembly to be kept at Scone (for the election of a new king) there to be holden within 15
daies after. Whither the Scotish nobilitie comming togither at the time &amp; place appointed,
and consenting to crowne Malcolme king, he vtterlie refused to receiue the crowne, except
<note place="marg">Malcolme refuseth the crowne but vpon c&omacr;dition.</note>

<note place="marg">The ordin&amacr;ce of king Kenneth for the succession of the crowne is confirmed.</note>
the law established by his father Kenneth for the succession thereof were first confirmed and
approoued, wherevpon the lords bound themselues by solemne othes to performe the same,
and neuer to breake and violate it in anie condition. His request herein being granted with
generall consent both of the nobles and commons, the crowne was set vpon his head, he
being placed in the chaire of marble, to the great reioising of all the people present.</p>

<head>MALCOLME.</head>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">WHEN</hi> the solemnitie of this coronation was ended, he called before him againe all the
lords and p&eacute;eres of his realme, of the which, part had aided him in the last warres, and
part had b&eacute;ene assistant vnto his aduersarie Grime: and there vsed the matter in such wise
amongst them, that he made them all friends, each one promising to other to forget all
<note place="marg">Malcolme agr&eacute;eth the nobles of his realme.</note>
former offenses, displeasures, and controuersies past, which he did to auoid all intestine
trouble that might grow out of the rootes of such rancor and malice, as in time of the ciuill
discord had sproong vp among them. Further, for the better administration of iustice in
<note place="marg">Malcolmes wisdome in ordeining officers.</note>
due forme and maner, he bestowed publike offices vpon discr&eacute;et persons, skilfull in the laws
and ordinances of the realme. Other offices perteining to the warres &amp; defense of the
realme, he committed to such as were practised &amp; trained in such exercises, so that iustice
was ministred on all sides throughout the kingdome, with such equitie and vprightnesse, as
had not beene heard of in anie age before him. Whilest the Scotish estate was gouerned
in such happie wise, by the prudent policie of king Malcolme; it chanced that Sueno king
<note place="marg">Sueno king of Denmarke landed in England.</note>
of Danes landed in England with a mightie nauie, in purpose to reuenge the iniuries done
before vnto his people by the Englishmen.</p>
<p>This Sueno (as appeareth more at large in the historie of Denmarke) first being an
earnest persecutor of christian men, and punished by the diuine prouidence for his crueltie
in that behalfe, shewed by sundrie ouerthrowes receiued at the enimies hands, as in being
thrise taken prisoner, and in the end driuen and expelled out of his kingdome, he came into
Scotland for reliefe and succour, where through the wholesome instruction of godlie and
<note place="marg">Sueno c&omacr;uerted to the christian faith in Scotland.</note>
vertuous men, he renounced his heathenish bel&eacute;efe, and receiued the christian faith, and
being baptised, at length was restored home to his kingdome. Shortlie after with a mightie
armie of Danes, Gothes, Norwegians, and Swedeners, with other northerne people, he arriued (as is said) in England, and chased king Egeired into Northumberland, who there
<note place="marg">Egeldred (or as the Scots write Eldred), chased into Northumberland, getteth aid from the Scots.</note>
receiuing aid from the Scots, according to the league which latelie before he had contracted
with them, he determined eftsoones to trie the chance of battell with his enimies. Marching
forwards therefore towards them, he came to the riuer of Owse, n&eacute;ere to the banks whereof,
not farre from Yorke, he pitched downe his tents.</p>
<p>Then Sueno not forgetfull of the benefits and pleasures receiued but latelie at the

Scotishmens hands, sent an herald at armes vnto them, commanding them to depart their waies
home, and to refuse Egeldreds companie; either else to looke for most cruell battell at the
hands of the Danes, the Norwegians, and others the people of Germanie, there readie bent
to their destruction. Egeldred being aduertised that his aduersaries messenger was thus
come into his campe, caused him to be staied and arrested for a spie. And the same day
he brought foorth his battels readie ranged into the fields, to trie the matter by dint of
swoord, if Suene were so minded; who verie desirous to accept the offer, brought foorth
also his people in perfect order and well arraied to fight, so that there was no staie on either
part, but that togither they flue most fiercelie, &amp; in such eger wise, that neither side had

continuing certeine houres with great &amp; cruell slaughter, till at length the Englishmen were put
<note place="marg">The English men put to flight by the Danes.</note>
to flight, leauing the Danes a verie d&eacute;ere and bloudie victorie. The murther also that day of
the Scots was great, but yet nothing to the number of the Englishmen. Egeldred himselfe
with a few other, got a bote and passed ouer Ouse, so escaping out of the enimies hands,
<note place="marg">Egeldred escapeth by flight.</note>
but the rest were for the most part either taken or slaine.</p>
<p>Thus Egeldred being vtterlie vanquished and despairing of all recouerie, fled out of England ouer into Normandie, where he was verie friendlie receiued of Richard as then duke
of Normandie, and afterwards purchased such fauour there amongst the Normans, that he
maried the ladie Emme, daughter vnto the said duke, and begot of hir two sonnes, Alured
and Edward, as in the English chronicles more at large it dooth app&eacute;ere. Sueno hauing
thus ouercome his enimies, and now put in possesion of the whole realme of England, was
<note place="marg">Suenos cruell imagination.</note>
in mind to haue destroied all the English generation, so to establish the kingdome to him
and his posteritie for euer, without anie impeachment afterwards to be made by such as
should succ&eacute;ed of them that were then aliue. But the nobles of England aduertised of
<note place="marg">The nobles of England their humble petition vnto Sueno.</note>
Suenos determination, came humblie before his presence, &amp; falling downe on their kn&eacute;es at
his f&eacute;et, besought him in most pit full wise to haue compassion on their miserable estate,
who in times past being a most puissant nation, both by sea and land, were now satisfied (if
he would grant them life) to continue vnder what bondage and seruitude it should stand
with his pleasure to prescribe, for they desired neither possession of castels, townes, or other
souereignties, but onelie to liue with their wiues and children vnder subiection within their
owne natiue countrie, at the victors will and appointment.</p>
<p>Sueno, albeit he was of nature verie cruell, yet he qualified his displeasure by this humble submission of the English nobilitie; in such sort, that he vsed the victorie farre more
<note place="marg">Under what conditions Sueno licenced the Englishmen to liue in their owne countrie.</note>
gentlie, than at the first he had purposed, commanding that the whole English nation should
remaine in the countrie, but in such wise, as by no meanes they should presume to beare
anie armor or weapon, but to applie themselues vnto husbandrie, and other seruile occupations vnder the gouernement of the Danes, vnto whom they should resigne and deliuer all
their castels, forts, and strong holds: and taking an oth to be true liege men vnto Sueno,
as their souereigne lord and king; they should bring in (to be deliuered vnto his vse) all
their weapons and armor, with other munition for the warres, also all their gold and siluer,
aswell in plate as coine. If anie of the Englishmen refused thus to doo, proclamation was
made that he should immediatlie lose his life as a rebell and a disobedient person. These
conditions were hard, and hardlie vrged. The Englishmen were brought vnto such an extremitie, that they were faine to accept these conditions of peace, for other meane to auoid
present death they knew none. And thus was the dominion of England conquered by the
Danes, after the Saxons had reigned in the same 564 y&eacute;eres.</p>
<note place="marg">529. <emph>H.B.</emph></note>
<p>Such tyrannie also after this was vsed by the Danes, that none of the English nation was

admitted to anie office or rule within the realme, either spirituall or temporall, but were
vtterlie remoued from the same, and some of them cast in prison and dailie put in hazard
of their liues. Finallie, the Englishmen were brought into such miserable thraldome, that
euerie housholder within the realme was constreined to receiue and find at his owne proper
costs and charges, one Dane, who should continuallie giue good watch what was said or
doone in the house, and to aduertise the king thereof, for doubt of conspiracies or treasons
to be contriued and practised against his person and roiall estate. This Dane by the good
man of the house and his familie, for honor sake, was called lord Dane, which woord was
afterwards turned to a name of reproch, as where anie idle person liued loitering, without
the vse of some honest exercise to get his liuing withall, the people were and yet are

<p>&para; Thus farre out of Hector Boetius we haue shewed of Suenos dooings in England, the
which although it agr&eacute;e not in all points with our English histories, yet sith the historie of

histories be true, this which followeth touching Suenos inuading of Scotland, chanced before
that Egeldred, whome the Scotish writers name Eldred, was driuen to fl&eacute;e into Normandie.
For when that Sueno lastlie returned into England, and constreined Egeldred so to forsake
<note place="marg">Sueno landed h&eacute;ere this last time of his comming foorth of Denmarke into England in Iulie, in the y&eacute;ere 1013, &amp; departed this life in the beginning of Februarie, in the y&eacute;ere 1014.</note>
the land, he liued not long after but departed this life about Candelmas, in the y&eacute;ere 1014
(as in the English histories ye may read more at large) not hauing time to make anie such
iournie into Scotland: so that it may be thought, if he did enterprise anie such exploit
there, it was before this his last arriuall in England.</p>
<p>But now to proc&eacute;ed according to that which we find in the foresaid Boetius. Sueno
hauing spoiled the Englishmen of their liberties (in manner before remembred, or rather
brought them to become tributaries vnto him, as at the first time of his arriuall here he
did in deed, he thought it necessarie, for the more suertie of his estate in England, to conclude some peace or league with his neighbours the Normans, Britains, &amp; Scots, vnder condition that they should not support anie Englishman against him. But forsomuch as he
could not compasse his intention h&eacute;erein, he furnished all the castels and fortresses on the
sea-coasts, ouer against Normandie, with men, munition, and vittels, to resist all sudden inuasions that might be attempted on that side. And on the other part towards the north,
<note place="marg">Sueno prepareth to inuade the Scots.</note>

<note place="marg">Olauus, and Onetus.</note>
he made all the prouision he could deuise to make mortall wars vpon the Scots: and the
more to annoie his enimies, he sent commandement vnto Olauus his lieutenant in Norwaie,
and to Onetus his deputie in Denmarke, to come with all the power they might leauie into
Scotland, to make warres on his enimies there.</p>
<p>Wherevpon shortlie after those foresaid capteins arriued with an huge armie in the mouth
<note place="marg">The Danes land in Scotland.</note>
of Speie, and landed in such puissant order, that the inhabitants of Murrey land fled out of
their houses, with their wiues, children, and goods (such as they could conueie awaie with
them) into places where they thought to remaine most out of danger. But the Danes,
<note place="marg">The crueltie of the Danes.</note>
after their manner, burne and spoile all before them, aswell churches and chappels, as other
buildings and edifices. Such of the people as could not fl&eacute;e in time, but by chance fell
into their hands, were slaine without all mercie. Also all the strengths and holds in the
countrie were taken by the Danes, thr&eacute;e castels onelie excepted: that is to say, Elgin, Fores,
and Narne, which the Danes named afterwards Burg, and for that they trusted (when the
same was woone) the other two would yeeld without anie further defense, they first laid siege
<note place="marg">The castell of Narne besieged.</note>
vnto this castell of Narne, inforsing themselues with all their power to win it: but in the
meane time, they were informed how Malcolme the Scotish king was come within fiue miles
of them with all the forces of his realme to giue them battell.</p>
<p>Incontinentlie herevpon they raised their siege, and hasted foorth to m&eacute;et him, with no
lesse courage than if victorie were alreadie present in their hands. Shortlie after, there came
<note place="marg">Malcolme sendeth ambassadors to the Danes.</note>

<note place="marg">The Danes slea the ambassadors.</note>
vnto them heralds also from Malcolme, to vnderstand whie they had thus inuaded his realme
with open and most cruell warre, hauing no occasion giuen by him or his subiects so to
doo: who scarselie had doone their message, but that they were slaine foorth with by cruell
outrage of the Danes. Malcolme being sore mooued to vnderstand the law obserued by
all nations for the safetie of messengers to be thus violated by the enimies, kept on his
iournie with the more fierce courage, till he came to a medow a little beside Killos, where
he incamped for that night. Great noise and clamour was heard throughout the armie,
euerie man being desirous of battell, to reuenge the iniuries doone by the Danes against
their friends and countriemen: notwithstanding on the morrow, when they saw their
enimies in farre greater number, and in better order than euer had b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene by anie of
<note place="marg">The Scots through feare are astonied.</note>
them before that time, their hart began to wax faint, hauing greater care which waie to saue

<p>Malcolme perceiuing such dread to be entred into the harts of his people, that they were
<note place="marg">Malcolms woords to his nobles.</note>
now more like to run awaie than to fight, if he should bring them foorth to battell, got him
to a little hill, and calling his nobles about him, he declared vnto them how he could not

without further triall of their forces. "&para; At home (said he) ye are most hardie and valiant,
where no danger app&eacute;ereth. What rebuke then is it vnto you, to be thus faint harted
(now that ye are come where valiancie should be shewed) in degenerating so far from your
woorthie fathers and noble progenitors, the which at Loncart vnder the conduct of my
<note place="marg">Loncart.</note>
father Kenneth, obteined so famous a victorie of the selfe same nation, whose furious puissance ye s&eacute;eme now so much to feare? There hath b&eacute;ene triall made in battell with this
enimie in our time, both within the bounds of Scotland, and also of England, to the great
honor and renowme of our elders. What discomfitures the Danes haue receiued are yet
fresh in memorie, so manie of them losing their liues amongst vs, that Albion may well be
<note place="marg">Albion the sepulture of Danes.</note>
reckoned the sepulture of Danes; as some of you can well record by your owne remembrance, and other haue heard by report of their forefathers and ancestors. Ye ought then
(said he) to be of good courage, rather than to faint now at n&eacute;ed, considering ye haue to
doo with those enimies, who are but the remnant of the other, which before haue b&eacute;ene
vanquished and ouerthrowne by Scotishmen, both at Loncart, and in diuerse other places;
yea and besides that, such as moouing warres now at this present without iust occasion,
haue violated the lawes both of God and man, deseruing thereby iust vengeance at Gods
hands, the punisher of all such vniust offendors. There is great hope therefore of victorie
(said he) left vnto all such as fight against these enimies, if we take manlie harts vnto vs,
and shew our selues in valiant constancie like to our elders, whereby it shall then app&eacute;ere
what outragious follie remained in the Danes, to inuade vs without occasion of iniuries preceding. Therefore if ye haue not more regard to the safetie of your fraile bodies, which
must n&eacute;edes at length perish, than to the defense and preseruation of your common countrie; why passe ye not forward, sith there is now no place nor time to take longer aduise
in the matter, as ye may well vnderstand by the presence of the enimie readie to ioine?"</p>
<p>The nobles mooued with these woords of their prince, began boldlie to exhort their people to battell. Incontinentlie whervpon rose such noise and raging furie through the armie,
that without measuring either their owne forces or their enimies, they rush foorth vpon them
<note place="marg">The Scots without order rush foorth to battell.</note>
without anie order or good araie. Olauus &amp; Onetus beholding the Scots to come thus
furiouslie against them, boldlie incountred them with arraied battels. Wherevpon insued a
verie terrible fight, with great manhood shewd on both sides, nothing being let passe that
might apperteine to woorthie capteins: the Scots inforcing themselues to defend their countrie and ancient liberties on the one side, and the Danes dooing their best indeuour by
valiant hardinesse to saue their liues and honors on the other. At length, after huge murther
<note place="marg">The Scots put to flight.</note>

<note place="marg">Malcolme is wounded.</note>
&amp; slaughter made on both parts, the Scots were put to flight, Malcolme was sore wounded,
&amp; had his helmet so fast beaten to his head, that it might not well be got off, yet was he
conueied out of the field in maner for dead, and kept secret in a wood, till he was somewhat
amended, and then got him into places out of danger. The Danes hauing got this victorie,
and gathered the spoile of the field, returned to besiege eftsoones the castell of Narne, with
more force and violence than before.</p>
<p>This castell in those daies was inclosed on ech side with the sea, hauing one narrow passage
as an entrie vnto it, made by craft of man in manner of a bridge. Those that were within
it, hauing knowledge of the ouerthrow and losse of the field, rendered the fortresse, on

<note place="marg">The Danes breakers of faith and promise.</note>
condition, that leauing all their armor, weapon, and other munitions behind them, they might
depart with their liues and other goods saued. Neuerthelesse the Danes, contrarie to their
faith giuen, being once entred the castell, hanged all those which they found within it ouer
the wals, in most despitefull manner. Thus was Narne woone by the Danes, the strongest
hold within Murrey land, and so garnished with men, munition, and vittels, that it was
thought impregnable. Then those souldiers which kept Elgin and Fores, hearing what
crueltie the Danes had thus vsed, fled out of those castels, and left them void without anie
<note place="marg">Elgin and Fores left void.</note>
person to defend them. The Danes reioising at this good fortune, trusted to establish themselues sure seates in Murrey land, and therevpon sent backe their ships into Norwaie and

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"259"</fw>-->

Denmarke, to fetch from thence their wiues and children. In the meane time they constreined such Scots as they had laid hands on, to reape and inne the corne growing abroad
in the fields, vnto their vse and commoditie.</p>
<p>K. Malcolme being aduertised of all these things, doubting least by the arriuall of new aid,
his enimies might wax more puissant, in the beginning of the next summer he assembled a great
multitude of warriors, and came in good order and most warlike arraie vnto Murthlake, a
<note place="marg">Murthlake.</note>
towne of Mar, where the first erection of the bishops s&eacute;e of Abirden was founded. H&eacute;ere
the one armie comming in sight of the other, they were suddenlie both amazed. For the Scots
<note place="marg">The Scots and Danes one afraid of another.</note>
hauing had too much experience of the crueltie shewed afore time by the Danes, were put in
no small feare now at the plaine &amp; open sight of them. The Danes being farre off from the sea
side, and vpon an vnknowne ground, were more afraid of some guilefull practise, than of the
open violence and force of their enimies. Yet neuerthelesse in the end, by the incouragement
of the capteins on both sides, they buckled togither with great fiercenesse and most cruell malicious hatred on ech hand.</p>
<p>In the first brunt thr&eacute;e valiant capteins, that is to say, Kenneth of Ila, Grime of Stratherne,
and Patrike of Dunbar, rushing ouer fiercelie on their enimies, were slaine, and gaue occasion
<note place="marg">The Scots forced to retire.</note>
to manie of the Scotishmen to flee, but the place was such, that they could not well make
their course anie waie foorth, by reason of the narrownesse thereof, fensed on either side with
deepe trenches full of water and mud: also in trauerse were laid sundrie tr&eacute;es, as it had b&eacute;ene
of purpose to impeach the passage, deuised in that sort (as was thought) in time of some ciuill
warres. Here though Malcolme like a valiant champion, did his best to staie them that fled,
yet was he borne backe with the preasse, till he came to the middest of this place, where stood
a chappell dedicated in the honor of saint Moloke, the which Malcolme beholding, cast vp his
hands towards heauen, making his praier on this wise. "&para; Great God of vertue, rewarder of
<note place="marg">Malcolmes praier.</note>
pietie, and punisher of sinne, we thy people seeking to defend our natiue countrie granted to
vs of thy beneuolence, as now destitute of all mortall helpe, and thus oppressed with the iniurious inuasion of Danes, doo flee vnto th&eacute;e in this our extreme necessitie, bes&eacute;eching thee to
haue compassion vpon our miserable estate: remooue (oh mercifull lord) this dreadfull terror
<note place="marg">To you, that is to God, and our ladie, and saint Moloke, for so he ioined them togither according to the manner of that time.</note>
from thy people. And oh thou mother of God, the sweet refuge of mortall people in their
distresse and miseries: and thou saint Moloke to whom this chappell was dedicate, helpe vs at
this present, and in the honor of you I h&eacute;ere make a vow to build a cathedrall church for a
bishops s&eacute;e, to remaine as a monument, to testifie vnto our posteritie, that by your support our
realme hath b&eacute;ene defended."</p>
<p>Scarselie had Malcolme made an end of this praier, when diuers of the nobles with a lowd
voice, as though they had b&eacute;ene assured that his praier was heard, cried to their companies;
Stand good fellows, for suerlie it is the pleasure of almightie God, that we returne and renew
the battell against our enimies. H&eacute;erevpon rose a woonderfull noise amongst the souldiers,
<note place="marg">The Scots oftentimes renew battell.</note>
eth one incouraging other to withstand the enimies, and to fight in most manfull wise in defense of their countrie and ancient liberties, &amp; foorthwith as it had b&eacute;ene by miracle they returned vpon their enimies, making great slaughter on ech side, without regard to their liues or
bloudie wounds, which they boldlie and without feare receiued. Heerewith Malcolme with
an ambushment of stout warriors came vpon Onetus, who was pransing vp and downe the
field without anie helmet on his head, as though the Scots had b&eacute;ene alreadie without recouerie clearelie discomfited, and so there was he beaten downe beside his horsse, and amongst
the footmen slaine out of hand. The residue of the Danes beholding the slaughter of their
<note place="marg">Onetus is slaine.</note>
capteine, staied from further pursute on the Scots. Heereofinsued great boldnese to the Scots,
and discouragement to the Danes: albeit the battell continued still a long space, the souldiers
dooing their best on either side, till at length the Danes were put to flight, manie of them
<note place="marg">The Danes put to flight.</note>

<note place="marg">Olauus fl&eacute;eth into Murrey land.</note>
being slaine, and but few taken. Olauus beholding the discomfiture of his people, and how his
companion in authoritie was slaine, fled into Murrey land with a small companie about him.</p>
<p>The next day, Malcolme considering what a number of his most valiant capteins he had lost
in this battell, diuided the spoile of the field amongest his men, and ceassing from further

pursute of the Danes at that time, went into Angus, where he remained the residue of the y&eacute;ere
within the castell of Forfair, taking counsell with his nobles touching the publike affaires of the
realme, and how to recouer his countrie of Murrey land out of the enimies hands.King
Sueno hearing in the meane time how infortunatelie his people had sped thus in Scotland at
<note place="marg">Sueno prepareth a new armie to inuade Scotland.</note>
the battell of Murthlake, in reuenge thereof determined to inuade the Scots with two mightie
nauies, the one to be rigged in England, and to come foorth of the riuer of Thames; and
the other to be sent from Denmarke, one Camus a Dane, verie expert in warlike knowledge,
<note place="marg">Camus appointed capteine generall of the Danes.</note>
being appointed to be gouernor of all the men of warre that should come from both those
parties.</p>
<p>The yeare next insuing, both these fl&eacute;ets according to commandement and order giuen, arriued and met togither within the mouth of the Forth, n&eacute;ere tosaint Ebbes head. Here Camus
<note place="marg">Saint Ebbes head.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots k&eacute;epe off the Danes from landing.</note>
going about to land his men, was kept off by the stout resistance of the Scots, there assembled
for the same intent. Camus then plucking vp the sailes, directed his course vnto the Ile of
Sketh, where riding at anchor for the space of one moneth, and abiding for some prosperous
wind, at length when the same came once about, he passed from thence vnto the Redbraies,
called in Latine <emph>Rubrum promontorium,</emph> &amp; there landed his whole armie, before the countrie
<note place="marg">Camus with his armie landeth at the Redbraies.</note>
could be gathered to resist him. Camus being once landed, got him to the next hill, and beholding the ruine of the towne of Montros, which a few yeares before had b&eacute;ene destroied by
the Danes, he reioised not a little, for that his chance was to come on land in the selfe same
place, where the Danes had earst vanquished their enimies, hoping of like lucke in this his enterprise and present expedition.</p>
<p>After this, he tooke his iournie through Angus, sparing no maner of crueltie that might be

<note place="marg">The crueltie of the Danes.</note>

<note place="marg">The towne and church of Brechine destroied.</note>
deuised: cities, townes, villages and churches, with all maner of other buildings publike and
priuat were consumed with fire. At his comming to Brechine, for that the castell there in
those daies was of such strength, that it might not be hastilie woone, he caused the towne and
church being right faire and sumptuouslie built in honor of the Trinitie (to whom it was dedicated) to be spoiled, &amp; so raced to the earth, that one stone was not left standing vpon an
other. With these and the semblable cruelties, Camus raging both against God and man,
was finallie aduertised that king Malcolme was come to Dund&eacute;e with all the power of Scotland.Then suddenlie he tooke the next way towards the sea side, comming the next day following vnto a village called Balbrid, where he pitched downe his tents. The same day, king
<note place="marg">King Malcolme hasteth foreward to fight with the Danes.</note>
Malcolme making all hast possible to succour his subiects, and preserue the countrie from the
cruell outrage of the Danes, came to the towne of Barre two little miles from the place, where
his enimies were incamped. In the morning he drew into the field, in purpose to giue them
open battell.</p>
<p>But before he arraied his battels, he called his nobles and capteins togither, desiring them to
<note place="marg">Malcolmes oration.</note>
consider how they should match in fight against people blinded with vile auarice, liuing on the
spoile and pillage got by th&eacute;euerie, and not by anie iust warres: enimies not onelie to the
christian faith, but also to all innocent people, whome they sought vninstlie to inuade, without
hauing occasion so to doo, saue onelie vpon an iniurious meaning to liue by spoile of other
mens goods, wherein they haue no maner of propertie. He willed them therfore to remember how they were come thus against those enimies in defense of their natiue countrie, appointed vndoubtedlie by God to reuenge the cruell iniuries doone by the Danes against his
name, and people that professed the same. They ought not then to measure force in number
of souldiers, but rather in manhood and valiancie of heart. Camus likewise exhorted his 
<note place="marg">Camus exhorteth his Danes.</note>
people, not vsing manie words, but yet pithie, desiring them to remember how it behooued them
either to win immortall fame by victorie, either else to die with miserie in an vncouth land, by
the hand of their most fierce and cruell enimies.</p>
<p>Herewith Malcolme imbattelling his people, brought them foorth stronglie ranged in good
order to incounter the Danes, which likewise approched towards him in good arraie of battell.
His heart was filled the more with hope of victorie, for that he had tried sundrie times before
the force of the enimies in diuers conflicts and encounters. For such is the nature of noble and

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"valiant"</fw>-->

valiant stomachs, the more experience they haue in honorable enterprises, the more are they
<note place="marg">The nature of valiant hearts and noble stomachs.</note>

<note place="marg">A bloudie battell.</note>
kindled in desire to shew their powers in famous acts and woorthie attempts. The armies
herevpon on both sides, fiercelie rushing togither, began a battell right cruell &amp; terrible, continuing certeine houres with such bloudshed, that the riuer of Lochtee ran with a purple hue
downe into the Almaine seas. The fields also where they fought, though they were full of
sand (as the nature of the soile giueth) yet were they made moist by the abundance of bloud
spilled in the same. Manie there were so earnestlie bent to be reuenged on the enimie, that
after they had their deaths wound, they would run themselues foreward vpon their aduersaries
weapon, till they might close with him, inforcing their vttermost powers to dispatch him also;
so that diuers were s&eacute;ene to fall to the ground togither fast grasping one another, and so immediatlie both of them to die withall: such burning hatred kindled their harts, that thus were they
wholie set on renenge. At length yet the honor of the field remained with Malcolme.</p>
<note place="marg">Malcolme winneth the field.</note>
<p>Camus perceiuing the discomfiture to light on his side, with a small companie about him
thought to haue escaped by flight vnto the next mounteins, but being pursued of his
enimies, he was slaine by them yer he was got two miles from the place of the battell.
<note place="marg">Camus is slaine.</note>
The place where he was slaine, is named after him vnto this day, and called Camestone, where is an obeliske set vp in memorie of the thing, with his picture grauen therein, and
<note place="marg">An obeliske.</note>
likewise of those that slue him. The principall slear of Camus was one Keith, a yoong 
<note place="marg">The house of Keithes aduanced to honor.</note>
gentleman of right hardie courage, whose seruice in the battell was verie notable, in recompense
whereof he was rewarded by king Malcolme, with sundrie lands and faire possessions in Louthian. His familie (saith Hector Boetius) bath and dooth continue in great honor amongest
Scotishmen euen vnto this day, and is decorated with the office of the marshalship of Scotland,
to the high renowme and fame thereof, amongest the chiefest p&eacute;ers of the realme.</p>
<p>An other companie of the Danes flieng from this ouerthrow were slaine at Abirlemnon, not

past foure miles from Brechin, where is set vp a great stone or obeliske, grauen with certeine
characters or letters, to aduertise them that passe that waies foorth, of this slaughter of Danes
there made by our woorthie elders. The residue of the Danes that escaped with life from the
field, hauing certeine Scotishmen to their guides corrupted with monie fled to their ships, declaring to their fellowes what mishap had fortuned. King Malcolme after he obteined this 
<note place="marg">The diuiding of the spoile.</note>
famous victorie (as before is said) at Barre, he caused the spoile of the field to be diuided
amongest his souldiers, according to the laws of armes; and then caused the dead bodies of
the Danes to be buried in the place where the field had b&eacute;ene fought, and the bodies of the
Scotishmen which were found dead were conueied vnto the places of christian buriall, and
there buried with funerall obsequies in sundrie churches and churchyards. There are s&eacute;ene
<note place="marg">Bones of Danes.</note>
manie bones of the Danes in those places where they were buried, there lieng bare aboue
ground euen vnto this day, the sands (as it often chanceth) being blowen from them. The
other Danes, which escaped to their ships, pulled vp sailes to haue passed into Murrey land
vnto Olauus, but remaining on the seas the space of foure daies togither, tossed to and fro by
contrarie winds, at length by a streinable east wind they were driuen vpon the coast of Buchquhan, and through want of conuenable harbrough were in present danger to haue b&eacute;ene cast
away. At length, after they had ridden at anchor in the Firth there, to their great displeasure
a long space, and finding no prosperous winds to depart from the shore, for that their vittels
began to faile them, they set flue hundred of their best and lusuest souldiers on land, to
fetch in some bootie or preie of cattell, therewith to relieue their hunger and famine. They
that were thus sent foorth, being perfectlie appointed with armour and weapon, ranged abroad
till they had got togither a great number of beasts, with the which drawing towards their ships,
they were incountred by the way by Marnachus the thane of Buchquhane accompanied with

though diuers of them were slaine in that assault. Those which wan the height of the crag
vpon the Danes, made such a cruell battell with them, that there was not one Dane that
escaped their hands.</p>
<p>This conflict was fought n&eacute;ere vnto Gemmer a village or towne in Buchquhane, where, in
<note place="marg">Danes slaine n&eacute;ere vnto Gemmer.</note>
memorie thereof, lie manie great bones of the Danes to be s&eacute;ene yet euen vnto these daies. It
should appeare by the same bones, that men in former time were of more huge growth and
stature, than they be at this present. The other Danes which were on ship bord, vnderstanding what had happened to their fellowes (because they returned not againe to the ships) so
soone as the wind came about for their purpose, hoised vp sailes, and tooke their course foorthright towards Murrey land. In the meane time king Sueno hearing of these ouerthrowes,
<note place="marg">Sueno prepareth the third time to inuade Scotland.</note>

<note place="marg">Canute brother vnto Sueno, appointed generall to come against the Scots.</note>
which his people had in such sort receiued at the Scotishmens hands, as a prince of a right
haughtie courage, not lightlie ouercome with anie aduerse fortune, made preparation in all
sp&eacute;edie wise to be reuenged, appointing his brother Canute, as then hauing the administration
of Denmarke, to come from thence with a new fl&eacute;ete and armie against the Scots. It is said,
that this Canute, according to order prescribed him by his brother Sueno, landed first in Buchquhane, and destroied a great part of that countrie by fire and sword, in reuenge of the slaughter of his countriemen the Danes, which had b&eacute;ene there made latelie before.</p>
<p>Malcolme sore kindled in wrath by these iniuries, though through continuance of the wars
<note place="marg">King Malcolmes determination.</note>
his power was greatlie decaied, yet did he assemble an armie with all sp&eacute;ed he could deuise,
and marched with the same towards the Danes, in purpose to staie them with often skirmishes and light incounters, but in no wise to ieopard with them in anie pitcht field or generall battell, for feare least if he had the ouerthrow, he should not be able to furnish a new
power for defense of his countrie, against the rage of the enimies. For the space therefore of
fift&eacute;ene daies togither, there was often skirmishing betwixt the parties. The which terme being
expired, the Scots beholding so huge murder of their countriemen and friends, with the spoile
of the fields, and destruction of the townes and villages, burning and blasing on each side before their faces, they come to king Malcolme, and desired him that he would grant them 
<note place="marg">The Scotishmens request vnto their king for licence to fight.</note>
licence to fight with their enimies, protesting plainelie, that if he would not consent thereto, they
would giue battell at their owne choise.</p>
<p>Malcolme perceiuing the earnest minds of his people to incounter their enimies in plaine
field, and that he might no longer protract the time, he granted their petition, and therewith beseeching them to remember their honors and dueties: incontinentlie the onset was giuen with
<note place="marg">The onset is giuen.</note>
great hatred and malice on either part, so that most egerlie continuing in fight a long time,
they inforced themselues to rid each other out of life: so that all the nobles well n&eacute;ere on both
sides were slaine, the name of victorie rather than the victorie it selfe remaining with the Scots,
<note place="marg">The Scots wan the name of victorie, rather than victorie it selfe.</note>
who were so f&eacute;eble and faint with long fight &amp; slaughter, that in the end of the battell they were
not able to pursue those few of the Danes, which escaping with life fled faintlie out of the field.
And so for that night, which followed the day of this bloudie battell, they lodged heere and
there in seuerall places, at aduenture as well as they might.</p>
<p>On the morow after, when it was vnderstood on both parties, what losse they had susteined,
their minds were conuerted rather to peace than to renew battell, bicause they were not of power
<note place="marg">Peace concluded for want of power to mainteine battell.</note>

<note place="marg">The articles of the peace betwixt the Danes and Scotishmen.</note>
longer to mainteine it. Wherevpon by mediation of such as tooke vpon them to treat a
peace, the same was concluded with these articles. First, that the Danes should depart out
of Murrey land, Buchquhan, and all other the bounds of Scotland. That the warres should
clearelie ceasse betwixt the Danes and Scotishmen, during the naturall liues of Sueno and Malcolme, or either of them. That neither of those two nations should aid or in anie wise support the others enimies. That the field where the last battell was fought, should be hallowed for
christian buriall, within the which the Danes that were slaine in the same battell should be buried, and a church to be built there, and lands appointed foorth for the maintenance of priests,
to celebrate there according to the order of the christian religion, then vsed by both the

people: for the Danes latelie before that season had also receiued the faith. This peace being ratified by the solemne othes of both the kings, Sueno and Malcolme, Canute with his Danes

resigning vp the possession of such holds and places as they held in Murrey land, Buchquhan, or
else where within anie part of the Scotish dominions, got him to his fl&eacute;et, and departed with
<note place="marg">Canute returneth into Denmarke.</note>
the same home into Denmarke.</p>
<p>King Malcolme hauing thus restored his countrie vnto ioifull peace, thought nothing so
good as to performe the articles of the agr&eacute;ement accorded betwixt him and the Danes, and
therefore caused a church to be builded in the place appointed, dedicating the same in honor
<note place="marg">A church builded.</note>
of saint Olauus patrone of Denmarke and Norwaie, to signifie vnto such as came after, that
sundrie nobles of the Danes laie buried in that church. In memorie hereof, the lands that
were giuen to the same church, are called euen yet vnto these daies Crowdan, which 
<note place="marg">Crowdan, what it signifieth.</note>
signifieth as much as if ye should say, The slaughter of Danes. The church which was first builded
there, chancing as often happeneth in those parties, to be ouercast with sands, an other was
erected in place not farre off, hauing a more commodious site. Sundrie of the bones of them
<note place="marg">Bones of Danes.</note>
that were buried in this place, being left bare by reason that the sands were blowne away besides them, Hector Boetius (the writer of the Scotish chronicle) beheld in the yeere 1521, which
s&eacute;emed more like vnto giants bones, than to men of common stature (as he auoucheth) whereby it should appeare, that men in old time were of much greater stature and quantitie of bodie, than anie that are to be found in these our daies.</p>
<p>Malcolme being thus deliuered of his enimies the Danes, caused publike praiers generallie
<note place="marg">Publike praiers.</note>
to be made throughout the realme, in rendring thanks to almightie God, that it had pleased
him to deliuer his people from the troubles of warre. He tooke order also, that churches
<note place="marg">The reparing of churches.</note>

<note place="marg">The restoring of lawes and iustice.</note>
should be repared, which by the enimies in time of the warres had b&eacute;ene destroied. And further, he caused the administration of the lawes and wholsome ordinances of the realme to be
vsed and put in practise, according to the due forme of the same, which manie y&eacute;eres before
could haue no place, by reason of the warres, He caused an assemblie of all the estates of
<note place="marg">A parlement at Bertha.</note>
his realme to be called at Bertha castell, in those daies standing not farre from the place where
the towne of Perth now standeth. In which conuention were manie things enacted, both for
the setting foorth of Gods honor, and the weale of the realme, whereby Malcolme wan much
praise amongst his subiects, to the eternall memorie of his name.</p>
<p>After this, supposing it most honorable to aduance the bloud of such as had serued well in
the last warres, or had their fathers or other friends slaine in the same, he cailed a parlement
<note place="marg">A parlement at Scone.</note>

<note place="marg">Diuision of the realme into baronies.</note>
at Scone, in the which, causing partition to be made of the realme, by diuiding it into baronies, he bestowed it amongest the nobles, according to the qualitie of euerie one his merits, reseruing in maner nothing to the maintenance of the crowne, common entries onelie excepted,
with the mounteine wherein the marble chaire stood, and a few other possessions which he
purposed to giue vnto churches and chappels. The nobles on the other part, to the end the
king might haue sufficient wherewith to mainteine his roiall estate, granted vnto him and his
successors for euer the custodie and wardship of their heires, if they chanced to die leauing
<note place="marg">The wardship of heires granted to the king.</note>
them under the age of 21 yeeres: and in the meane time till the same heires came to the
said age, they agreed that the king and his successors should inioy the vse and profits
of their lands, whether they were men or women, and when they came to the age of 21
yeeres, that then they should enter into the possession of their lands, y&eacute;elding vnto him or
his successors one y&eacute;eres rent in name of a reliefe; and if they chanced not to be married 
<note place="marg">Mariage of wards.</note>
before their fathers deceasse, then also should they marrie at the kings appointment, or else compound with him for the same.</p>
<p>Thus ended the parlement for that season, with great ioy and comfort on each hand, for
that the king had shewed such liberall bountiousnesse towards his barons, and they no lesse
mindfull of their duties had declared such beneuolent hearts, as appeared in that their fr&eacute;e and
large gift granted in forme and maner as before is expressed. Neither did Malcolme forget
the vow which he made at Murthlake, when he was in danger to haue receiued the ouerthrow
at the hand of the Danes. For according to the same vow, he caused a church to be built in
the same place, erecting a bishops see there, and indowed it with the lands &amp; possessions of
<note place="marg">The s&eacute;e of Murthlake, otherwise Aberden.</note>
these thr&eacute;e places, Murthlake, Cleometh, and Dunmeth, with all ecclesiasticall iurisdictions

and tithes apperteining thereto. The bishops that sat in this s&eacute;e were called the bishops
of Murthlake, till the daies of king Dauid the first, who changing the name, caused them
to be called the bishops of Abirden, augmenting the s&eacute;e with sundrie faire reuenues to the
better maintenance thereof.</p>
<p>Malcolme thus hauing purchased rest from further troubles of warre, gouerned the realme a
certeine time after in good order of iustice, and caused a booke to b&eacute;e set foorth, called <emph>Regia</emph>
<note place="marg">The booke called <emph>Regia maiestas.</emph></note>
<emph>maiestas,</emph> conteining the lawes and ordinances wherby the realme should be gouerned: and
assigning foorth in the same what f&eacute;es also should be giuen vnto the chancellor, secretarie, constable, marshall, chamberleine, iustice, treasuror, register, comptroller, and other the officers
of his house. Such princelie dooings and noble vertues were found in this Malcolme for a
season, that if the same had continued with him in his latter age, there had neuer reigned anie
king in Scotland, that might haue bene thought to haue passed him in worthie fame: neuertheles his excellent qualities were stained at length by that reprochfull vice of vile auarice. For

<note place="marg">Couetousnes and age arriuing togither.</note>

<note place="marg">Malcolmes erueltie to purchase riches.</note>
as it oftentimes happeneth, couetousnesse and age laid hold on him both at once. He then began to repent in that he had b&eacute;ene so liberall in giuing away his lands to his barons; &amp; to recouer the same againe, he surmized feigned matter by vntrue suggestions against diuerse of
the chiefest nobles, putting some to death, &amp; banishing other, that he might by this meanes
inioy their lands and goods as confiscate to the crowne for their supposed offenses.</p>
<p>The nobles hauing great indignation at such crueltie vsed by the king against them and their
linage, and that vpon no iust causes, but onelie vpon forged deuises, they conspired in 
<note place="marg">The conspiracie of the Scotish nobilitie against Malcolme.</note>

<note place="marg">Malcolme slaine at Glammis.</note>
sundrie m&eacute;etings secretlie appointed amongst them, to find some meanes to dispatch him out of

into their hands, fled for safegard of his life vnto Glammis, where diuerse of the conspirators
were brought into his lodging, by some of his owne houshold seruants, and there slue him in
reuenge of their friends, whome he before had wrongfullie put to death. These murtherers
with their complices incontinentlie fled with all sp&eacute;ed possible to auoid further danger for
this their act: but missing their way (for the ground was quite couered as then with snow)
they finallie came to the loch of Forfair, which was the same time frozen ouer. They therefore

might haue reigned by indifferent partition in them both, so should Duncane haue proued

was verie quiet and peaceable, without anie notable trouble; but after it was perceiued how
negligent he was in punishing offendors, manie misruled persons tooke occasion thereof to
trouble the peace and quiet state of the common-wealth, by seditious commotions which
first had their beginnings in this wise.</p>

get awaie with life, after he had receiued sundrie grieuous wounds amongst them. Yet
escaping their hands, after h&eacute;e was somewhat recouered of his hurts, and was able to ride,
he repaired to the court, where making his complaint to the king in most earnest wise, he
purchased at length that the offendors were sent for by a sergeant at armes, to appeare to
make answer vnto such matters as should be laid to their charge: but they augmenting their
<note place="marg">A sergeant at armes slaine by the rebels.</note>
mischiefous act with a more wicked d&eacute;ed, after they had misused the messenger with sundrie
kinds of reproches, they finallie slue him also.</p>
<p>Then doubting not but for such contemptuous demeanor against the kings regall authoritie, they should be inuaded with all the power the king could make, Makdowald one of

great estimation among them, making first a confederacie with his neerest friends and kinsmen, tooke vpon him to be chiefe capteine of all such rebels as would stand against the
king, in maintenance of their grieuous offenses latelie committed against him. Manie
slanderous words also, and railing tants this Makdowald vttered against his prince, calling
him a faint-hearted milkesop, more meet to gouerne a sort of idle moonks in some cloister,
than to haue the rule of such valiant and hardie men of warre as the Scots were. He vsed
also such subtill persuasions and forged allurements, that in a small time he had gotten togither a mightie power of men: for out of the westerne Iles there came vnto him a great
multitude of people, offering themselues to assist him in that rebellious quarell, and out of
Ireland in hope of the spoile came no small number of Kernes and Galloglasses, offering
gladlie to serue vnder him, whither it should please him to lead them.</p>
<p>Makdowald thus hauing a mightie puissance about him, incountered with such of the

kings people as were sent against him into Lochquhaber, and discomfiting them, by mere
force tooke their capteine Malcolme, and after the end of the battell smote off his head.
This ouerthrow being notified to the king, did put him in woonderfull feare, by reason of
<note place="marg">The smal skil of the king in warlike affaires.</note>
his small skill in warlike affaires. Calling therefore his nobles to a councell, he asked of
them their best aduise for the subduing of Makdowald &amp; other the rebels. Here, in sundrie
heads (as euer it happenerh) were sundrie opinions, which they vttered according to euerie

wife and children, and lastlie himselfe, least if he had yeelded simplie, he should haue b&eacute;ene

the gates, as then set open, found the carcasse of Makdowald lieng dead there amongst the
residue of the slaine bodies, which when he beheld, remitting no peece of his cruell nature
with that pitifull sight, he caused the head to be cut off, and set vpon a poles end, and so

<note place="marg">Makbeth defamed by the Ilandmen.</note>
a bloudie tyrant, &amp; a cruell murtherer of them whome the kings mercie had pardoned.
With which reprochfull words Makbeth being kindled in wrathfull ire against them, had passed
ouer with an armie into the Iles, to haue taken reuenge vpon them for their liberall talke,
had he not b&eacute;ene otherwise persuaded by some of his friends, and partlie pacified by gifts

<p>But here to the intent it maie be the better perceiued, what this Sueno was, I will somwhat touch from whence he descended. That Sueno, who (as ye haue heard) conquered

the realme of England, being also king of Denmarke and Norwaie, had thr&eacute;e sonnes,
Harold, Sueno, and Canute; the first he made king of England, the second king of Norwaie,
and the third king of Denmarke. Harold inioied not the same dominion of England past
three yeeres after his fathers deceasse, but was slaine by Etheldred or Egeldred, whom his
father Sueno had chased into Normandie. But the same Etheldred kept not long the kingdome in peace, for Canute king of Denmarke, to reuenge his brothers death, landed in
England with a mightie host, and sleaing Etheldred, recouered the kingdome to the vse of
the Danes: but yet one Edmund sonne to the foresaid Etheldred, surnamed Ironside, mainteined the warre against Canute for a season, till at length by both their consents they agr&eacute;ed
to fight a combat singularlie man to man, so to trie the matter betwixt them, who should
reigne as king ouer the Englishmen.</p>
<p>In this fight when they had continued a long space, and shewed right notable proofes of
their manhood: "Edmund (saith Canute) sith it hath pleased almightie God, that thou
<note place="marg">Canutes words to Edmund Ironside.</note>
shouldest thus trie the force of my hand without hurt or wound, I thinke it b&eacute;e likewise
his pleasure, that thou shouldest inioy part of the realme: go to therefore, I receiue th&eacute;e
as partener with me in the kingdome, so that (if thou be contented let vs diuide the kingdome betwixt vs without anie more contention." Edmund gladlie accepted this condition
of agreement, supposing it better to haue halfe the kingdome, than to stand to the doubtfull
triall of loosing the whole: for he had receiued a wound at Canutes hands, though Canute
vnderstood not so much: againe, he foresaw that occasion hereafter might be offered,
whereby he might without all trouble come to inioy the whole. Herevpon either of them

That part of England that lieth ouer against France was assigned vnto Canute; and the
other, that is, the north parts vnto Edmund. In the meane time Emma the wife of Etheldred, with hir two sonnes (which she had by the same Etheldred) Alured and Edward, fled
ouer into Normandie, doubting least this concord betwixt Canute and Edmund should rurne

most sp&eacute;edie wise, like a verie valiant capteine: for oftentimes it happeneth, that a dull

<p>The armie of Scotishmen being thus ordered, came vnto Culros, where incountering with

them at some aduantage. On the morrow, when the fields were discouered, and that it
was perceiued how no enimies were to be found abrode, they gathered the spoile, which
they diuided amongst them, according to the law of armes. Then was it ordeined by 
<note place="marg">Suenos commandement to spare fire and swoord.</note>
commandement of Sueno, that no souldier should hurt either man, woman, or child, except
such as were found with weapon in hand readie to make resistance, for he hoped now to
conquer the realme without further bloudshed.</p>
<p>But when knowledge was giuen how Duncane was fled to the castell of Bertha, and that
<note place="marg">Duncane fled to the castell of Bertha.</note>

<note place="marg">Sueno besiegeth king Malcolme.</note>
Makbeth was gathering a new power to withstand the incursions of the Danes, Sueno raised
his tents, &amp; comming to the said castell, laid a strong siege round about it. Duncane s&eacute;eing himselfe thus enuironed by his enimies, sent a secret message by counsell of Banquho
to Makbeth, commanding him to abide at Inchcuthill, till he heard from him some other
newes. In the meane time Duncane fell in fained communication with Sueno, as though
<note place="marg">Fained treatie.</note>
he would haue y&eacute;elded vp the castell into his hands, vnder certeine conditions, and this
did he to driue time, and to put his enimies out of all suspicion of anie enterprise ment
against them, till all things were brought to passe that might serue for the purpose. At
length, when they were fallen at a point for rendring vp the hold, Duncane offered to send
foorth of the castell into the campe great prouision of vittels to refresh the armie, which
offer was gladlie accepted of the Danes, for that they had b&eacute;ene in great penurie of sustenance manie daies before.</p>
<p>The Scots h&eacute;erevpon tooke the iuice of mekilwoort berries, and mixed the same in their
<note place="marg">Spiced cups prepared for the Danes.</note>
ale and bread, sending it thus spiced &amp; confectioned, in great abundance vnto their enimies.
They reioising that they had got meate and drinke sufficient to satisfie their bellies, fell to
eating and drmking after such greedie wise, that it s&eacute;emed they stroue who might deuoure
and swallow vp most, till the operation of the berries spread in such sort through all the
parts of their bodies, that they were in the end brought into a fast dead sleepe, that in
<note place="marg">The Danes ouercome with drinke, fall asl&eacute;epe.</note>
manner it was vnpossible to awake them. Then foorthwith Duncane sent vnto Makbeth,
commanding him with all diligence to come and set vpon the enimies, being in easie point
to be ouercome. Makbeth making no delaie, came with his people to the place, where his
<note place="marg">Makbeth assaileth the campe of the Danes, being ouercome with drinke and sl&eacute;epe.</note>
enimies were lodged, and first killing the watch, afterwards entered the campe, and made
such slaughter on all sides without anie resistance, that it was a woonderfull matter to behold, for the Danes were so heauie of sl&eacute;epe, that the most part of them were slaine and
neuer stirred: other that were awakened either by the noise or other waies foorth, were so
amazed and dizzie headed vpon their wakening, that they were not able to make anie defense: so that of the whole number there escaped no more but onelie Sueno himselfe and

Scots had sent vnto the campe, came from the sea thither to be partakers thereof, and so
were slaine amongst their fellowes: by meanes whereof when Sueno perceiued how through
lacke of mariners he should not be able to conueie awaie his nauie, he furnished one ship
<note place="marg">Sueno fl&eacute;eth with one ship, leauing the residue of his nauie behind him.</note>

<note place="marg">The fl&eacute;ete of the Norwegians sunke by vehement rage of winds.</note>
throughlie with such as were left, and in the same sailed backe into Norwaie, cursing the
time that he set forward on this infortunate iournie. The other ships which he left behind
him, within three daies after his departure from thence, were tossed so togither by violence
of an east wind, that beating and rushing one against another, they sunke there, and lie in
the same place euen vnto these daies, to the great danger of other such ships as come on
that coast: for being couered with the floud when the tide commeth, at the ebbing againe
of the same, some part of them app&eacute;ere aboue water.</p>
<p>The place where the Danish vessels were thus lost, is yet called Drownelow sands. This
<note place="marg">Drownelow sands.</note>
ouerthrow receiued in manner afore said by Sueno, was verie displeasant to him and his
people, as should app&eacute;ere, in that it was a custome manie yeeres after, that no knights were
made in Norwaie, except they were first sworne to reuenge the slaughter of their

countriemen and friends thus slaine in Scotland. The Scots hauing woone so notable a victorie,
after they had gathered &amp; diuided the spoile of the field, caused solemne processions to be
made in all places of the realme, and thanks to be giuen to almightie God, that had sent
them so faire a day ouer their enimies. But whilest the people were thus at their processions, woord was brought that a new fl&eacute;et of Danes was arriued at Kingcorne, sent thither
by Canute king of England, in reuenge of his brother Suenos ouerthrow. To resist these
enimies, which were alreadie landed, and busie in spoiling the countrie; Makbeth and
Banquho were sent with the kings authoritie, who hauing with them a conuenient power,
incountred the enimies, slue part of them, and chased the other to their ships. They that
escaped and got once to their ships, obteined of Makbeth for a great summe of gold, that
such of their friends as were slaine at this last bickering, might be buried in saint Colmes
Inch. In memorie whereof, manie old sepultures are yet in the said Inch, there to be seene
grauen with the armes of the Danes, as the maner of burieng noble men still is, and h&eacute;eretofore hath b&eacute;ene vsed.</p>
<p>A peace was also concluded at the same time betwixt the Danes and Scotishmen, ratified
<note place="marg">A peace concluded betwixt Scots and Danes.</note>
(as some haue written) in this wise: That from thencefoorth the Danes should neuer come
into Scotland to make anie warres against the Scots by anie maner of meanes. And these
were the warres that Duncane had with forren enimies, in the seuenth y&eacute;ere of his reigne.
Shortlie after happened a strange and vncouth woonder, which afterward was the cause
of much trouble in the realme of Scotland, as ye shall after heare. It fortuned as Makbeth and Banquho iournied towards Fores, where the king then laie, they went sporting by
the waie togither without other companie, saue onelie themselues, passing thorough the
woods and fields, when suddenlie in the middest of a laund, there met them thr&eacute;e women in
strange and wild apparell, resembling creatures of elder world, whome when they attentiuelie
beheld, woondering much at the sight, the first of them spake and said; "All haile 
<note place="marg">The prophesie of thr&eacute;e women supposing to be the weird sisters or feiries.</note>
Makbeth, thane of Glammis" (for he had latelie entered into that dignitie and office by the death
of his father Sinell.) The second of them said; "Haile Makbeth thane of Cawder." But
the third said; "All haile Makbeth that h&eacute;ereafter shalt be king of Scotland."</p>
<p>Then Banquho; "What manner of women (saith he) are you, that s&eacute;eme so little fauourable vnto me, whereas to my fellow heere, besides high offices, ye assigne also the kingdome, appointing foorth nothing for me at all?" "Yes (saith the first of them) we promise
greater benefits vnto th&eacute;e, than vnto him, for he shall reigne in d&eacute;ed, but with an vnluckie
end: neither shall he leaue anie issue behind him to succ&eacute;ed in his place, where contrarilie
thou in d&eacute;ed shalt not reigne at all, but of th&eacute;e those shall be borne which shall gouerne
the Scotish kingdome by long order of continuall descent." Herewith the foresaid women
vanished immediatlie out of their sight. This was reputed at the first but some vaine 
<note place="marg">A thing to woonder at.</note>
fantasticall illusion by Mackbeth and Banquho, insomuch that Banquho would call Mackbeth
in iest, king of Scotland; and Mackbeth againe would call him in sport likewise, the father
<note place="marg">Banquho the father of manie kings.</note>

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"of"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"269"</fw>-->

of manie kings. But afterwards the common opinion was, that these women were either
the weird sisters, that is (as ye would say) the goddesses of destinie, or else some nymphs
or feiries, indued with knowledge of prophesie by their necromanticall science, bicause
euerie thing came to passe as they had spoken. For shortlie after, the thane of Cawder 
<note place="marg">The thane of Cawder condemned of treason.</note>

<note place="marg">Mackbeth made thane of Cawder.</note>
being condemned at Fores of treason against the king committed; his lands, liuings, and offices
were giuen of the kings liberalitie to Mackbeth.</p>
<p>The same night after, at supper, Banquho iested with him and said; "Now Mackbeth thou
hast obteined those things which the two former sisters prophesied, there remaineth onelie
for th&eacute;e to purchase that which the third said should come to passe. Wherevpon Mackbeth
<note place="marg">Mackbeth deuiseth how he might atteine the kingdome.</note>
reuoluing the thing in his mind, began euen then to deuise how he might atteine to the
kingdome: but yet he thought with himselfe that he must tarie a time, which should aduance him thereto (by the diuine prouidence) as it had come to passe in his former preferment. But shortlie after it chanced that king Duncane, hauing two sonnes by his wife
<note place="marg">The daughter of Siward earle of Northumberland, wife to king Duncane.</note>
which was the daughter of Siward earle of Northumberland, he made the elder of them
called Malcolme prince of Cumberland, as it were thereby to appoint him his successor in
the kingdome, immediatlie after his deceasse. Mackbeth sore troubled herewith, for that
he saw by this means his hope sore hindered (where, by the old lawes of the realme, the
ordinance was, that if he that should succ&eacute;ed were not of able age to take the charge vpon
himselfe, he that was next of bloud vnto him should be admitted) he began to take counsell
<note place="marg">Mackbeth studieth which way he may take the kingdome by force.</note>
how he might vsurpe the kingdome by force, hauing a iust quarell so to doo (as he tooke
the matter) for that Duncane did what in him lay to defraud him of all maner of title and
claime, which he might in time to come, pretend vnto the crowne.</p>
<p>The woords of the thr&eacute;e weird sisters also (of whom before ye haue heard) greatlie

<note place="marg">Women desirous of high estate.</note>

<note place="marg">Mackbeth sleaeth king Duncane.</note>

<note place="marg">Mackbeth vsurpeth the crowne.</note>
incouraged him herevnto, but speciallie his wife lay sore vpon him to attempt the thing, as
she that was verie ambitious, burning in vnquenchable desire to beare the name of a queene.
At length therefore, communicating his purposed intent with his trustie friends, amongst
whome Banquho was the chiefest, vpon confidence of their promised aid, he slue the king
at Enuerns, or (as some say) at Botgosuane, in the sixt yeare of his reigne. Then hauing
a companie about him of such as he had made priuie to his enterprise, he caused himselfe
to be proclamed king, and foorthwith went vnto Scone, where (by common consent) he
receiued the inuesture of the kingdome according to the accustomed maner. The bodie of
Duncane was first conueied vnto Elgine, &amp; there buried in kinglie wise; but afterwards it
<note place="marg">Duncanes buriall.</note>

<note place="marg">1046. <emph>H.B.</emph></note>

<note place="marg">Mackbeths policie.</note>
(which they might well know that Mackbeth would s&eacute;eke to bring to end for his more sure
confirmation in the estate) fled into Cumberland, where Malcolme remained, till time that
saint Edward the sonne of Ethelred recouered the dominion of England from the Danish
power, the which Edward receiued Malcolme by way of most friendlie enterteinment: but
Donald passed ouer into Ireland, where he was tenderlie cherished by the king of that land.
Mackbeth, after the departure thus of Duncanes sonnes, vsed great liberalitie towards the
nobles of the realme, thereby to win their fauour, and when he saw that no man went
about to trouble him, he set his whole intention to mainteine iustice, and to punish all enormities and abuses, which had chanced through the f&eacute;eble and slouthfull administration of
Duncane. And to bring his purpose the better to passe without anie trouble or great businesse, he deuised a subtill wile to bring all offendors and misdooers vnto iustice, soliciting
sundrie of his liege people with high rewards, to challenge and appeale such as most oppressed the commons, to come at a day and place appointed, to fight singular combats
within barriers, in triall of their accusations. When these th&eacute;eues, barrettors, and other
oppressors of the innocent people were come to darren battell in this wise (as is said) they
were streight waies apprehended by armed men, and trussed vp in halters on gibbets, 
<note place="marg">Streict iustice.</note>
according as they had iustlie deserued. The residue of misdooers that were left, were

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"punished"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"270"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

punished and tamed in such sort, that manie yeares after all theft and reiffings were little
heard of, the people inioieng the blissefull benefit of good peace and tranquillitie. Mackbeth shewing himselfe thus a most diligent punisher of all iniuries and wrongs attempted
by anie disordered persons within his realme, was accounted the sure defense and buckler
of innocent people; and hereto he also applied his whole indeuor, to cause yoong men to
<note place="marg">A kinglie endeuour.</note>
exercise themselues in vertuous maners, and men of the church to attend their diuine
seruice according to their vocations.</p>
<p>He caused to be slaine sundrie thanes, as of Cathnes, Sutherland, Stranauerne, and Ros,
<note place="marg">Iustice ministred without respect of persons.</note>
because through them and their seditious attempts, much trouble dailie rose in the realme.
He appeased the troublesome state of Galloway, and slue one Makgill a tyrant, who had
manie yeares before passed nothing of the regall authoritie or power. To be briefe, such
were the woorthie dooings and princelie acts of this Mackbeth in the administration of the
realme, that if he had atteined therevnto by rightfull means, and continued in vprightnesse
of iustice as he began, till the end of his reigne, he might well haue b&eacute;ene numbred
amongest the most noble princes that anie where had reigned. He made manie holesome
laws and statutes for the publike weale of his subiects.</p>

<p>These and the like commendable lawes Makbeth caused to be put as then in vse, 
<note place="marg">Makbeths counterfeit zeale and equitie.</note>
gouerning the realme for the space of ten yeares in equall iustice. But this was but a counterfet zeale of equitie shewed by him, partlie against his naturall inclination to purchase
thereby the fauour of the people. Shortlie after, he began to shew what he was, in stead
of equitie practising crueltie. For the pricke of conscience (as it chanceth euer in tyrants,
<note place="marg">Makbeths guiltie conscience.</note>
and such as atteine to anie estate by vnrighteous means) caused him euer to feare, least he
should be serued of the same cup, as he had ministred to his predecessor. The woords
also of the three weird sisters, would not out of his mind, which as they promised him the
kingdome, so likewise did they promise it at the same time vnto the posteritie of Banquho.
He willed therefore the same Banquho with his sonne named Fleance, to come to a supper
<note place="marg">Makbeths deuise to slea Banquho and his sonne.</note>
that he had prepared for them, which was in d&eacute;ed, as he had deuised, present death at the
hands of certeine murderers, whom he hired to execute that d&eacute;ed, appointing them to
meete with the same Banquho and his sonne without the palace, as they returned to their
lodgings, and there to slea them, so that he would not haue his house slandered, but that
in time to come he might cleare himselfe, if anie thing were laid to his charge vpon anie
suspicion that might arise.</p>
<p>It chanced yet by the benefit of the darke night, that though the father were slaine, the
<note place="marg">Banquho is slaine, but his sonne escapeth.</note>
sonne yet by the helpe of almightie God reseruing him to better fortune, escaped that
danger: and afterwards hauing some inkeling (by the admonition of some friends which he
had in the court) how his life was sought no lesse than his fathers, who was slaine not by

chance medlie (as by the handling of the matter Makbeth would haue had it to appeare)
but euen upon a prepensed deuise: wherevpon to auoid further perill he fled into Wales

inioied the kingdome by so long continuance of descent, from one to another, and that euen
vnto these our daies, may be knowen from whence they had their first beginning.</p>
<p>Fleance therefore (as before is said) fled into Wales, where shortlie after by his courteous
and amiable behauiour, he grew into such fauor and estimation with the prince of that
countrie, that he might vnneath haue wished anie greater; at length also he came into such
familiar acquaintance with the said princes daughter, that she of courtesie in the end

within few yeares prooued a man of greater courage and valiancie, than anie other had
commonlie b&eacute;ene found, although he had no better bringing vp than (by his grandfathers
appointment) among the baser sort of people. Howbeit he shewed euer euen from his in.
fancie, that there reigned in him a certeine stoutnesse of stomach, readie to attempt high
enterprises.</p>
<p>It chanced that falling out with one of his companions, after manie tawnting words which
passed betwixt them, the other to his reproch obiected that he was a bastard, and begotten
in vnlawfull bed; wherewith being sore kindled, in his raging furie he ran vpon him and
slue him out of hand. Then was he glad to fl&eacute;e out of Wales, and comming into Scotland
<note place="marg">Walter fl&eacute;eth into Scotland.</note>
to s&eacute;eke some friendship there, he happened into the companie of such Englishmen, as were
come thither with qu&eacute;ene Margaret, and behaued himselfe so soberlie in all his demeanours,
<note place="marg">Saint Margaret.</note>
that within a while he was highlie esteemed amongest them. Not long after by such means
<note place="marg">Walter sent with an armie to daunt rebels.</note>
atteining to the degr&eacute;e of high reputation, he was sent with a great power of men into the
westerne Iles, into Galloway, &amp; other parts of the realme, to deliuer the same from the
tyrannie and iniurious oppression there exercised by diuers misgouerned persons; which enterprise according to his commission he atchiued, with such prudent policie and manhood,

Steward, that founded the abbeie of Pasleie of saint Benedicts order. Walter Steward, whose
valiancie was well notified at the battell of Largis, as hereafter shall be shewed, was the
sonne of the said Alexander. The same Walter had issue two sons, the one named Alexander, fought right valiantlie in defense of his father at the foresaid battell; and the other
named Robert Steward got the lands of Terbowtoune, and maried the heire of Crukeistoune,
from whom descended the earles of Leuenox and Dernlie. Moreouer, the aboue mentioned

pleasure.</p>
<p>At length he found such sw&eacute;etnesse by putting his nobles thus to death, that his earnest
thirst after bloud in this behalfe might in no wise be satisfied: for ye must consider he wan
double profit (as h&eacute;e thought) hereby: for first they were rid out of the way whome he
feared, and then againe his coffers were inriched by their goods which were forfeited to his
vse, whereby he might better mainteine a gard of armed men about him to defend his person from iniurie of them whom he had in anie suspicion. Further, to the end he might the
more cruellie oppresse his subiects with all tyrantlike wrongs, he builded a strong casteli on
the top of an hie hill called Dunsinane, situate in Gowrie, ten miles from Perth, on such
<note place="marg">The castell of Dunsinane builded.</note>
a proud height, that standing there aloft, a man might behold well neere all the countries
of Angus, Fife, Stermond, and Ernedale, as it were lieng vnderneath him. This castell
then being founded on the top of that high hill, put the realme to great charges before it
was finished, for all the stuffe necessarie to the building, could not be brought vp without
much toile and businesse. But Makbeth being once determined to haue the worke go forward, caused the thanes of each shire within the realme, to come and helpe towards that
building, each man his course about.</p>
<p>At the last, when the turne fell vnto Makduffe thane of Fife to build his part, he sent
<note place="marg">Makduffe thane of Fife.</note>
workemen with all n&eacute;edfull prouision, and commanded them to shew such diligence in euerie
behalfe, that no occasion might b&eacute;e giuen for the king to find fault with him, in that he
came not himselfe as other had doone, which he refused to doo, for doubt least the king
bearing him (as he partlie vnderstood) no great good will, would laie violent hands vpon
him, as he had doone vpon diuerse other. Shortlie after, Makbeth comming to behold
how the worke went forward, and bicause he found not Makduffe there, he was sore
<note place="marg">Makbeth is offended with Makduffe.</note>
offended, and said; I perceiue this man will neuer obeie my commandements, till he be
ridden with a snaffle: but I shall prouide well inough for him. Neither could he afterwards
abide to looke vpon the said Makduffe, either for that he thought his puissance ouer great;
either else for that he had learned of certeine wizzards, in whose words he put great 
<note place="marg">Makbeths confidence in wizzards.</note>
confidence (for that the prophesie had happened so right, which the thr&eacute;e faries or weird sisters
had declared vnto him) how that he ought to take h&eacute;ed of Makduffe, who in time to come
should seeke to destroie him.</p>
<p>And suerlie herevpon had he put Makduffe to death, but that a certeine witch, whome
hee had in great trust, had told that he should neuer be slaine with man borne of anie woman, not vanquished till the wood of Bernane came to the castell of Dunsinane. By this
prophesie Makbeth put all feare out of his heart, supposing he might doo what he would,
without anie feare to be punished for the same, for by the one prophesie he bel&eacute;eued it was
vnpossible for anie man to vanquish him, and by the other vnpossible to slea him. This vaine
hope caused him to doo manie outragious things, to the gr&eacute;euous oppression of his subiects. At
length Makduffe, to auoid perill of life, purposed with himselfe to passe into England, to procure Malcolme Cammore to claime the crowne of Scotland. But this was not so secretlie deuised by Makduffe, but that Makbeth had knowledge giuen him thereof: for kings (as is said)
haue sharpe sight like vnto Lynx, and long ears like vnto Midas. For Makbeth had in euerie
<note place="marg">Lynxs eies and Midas eares.</note>
noble mans house, one slie fellow or other in f&eacute;e with him, to reueale all that was said or doone
within the same, by which slight he oppressed the most part of the nobles of his realme.</p>
<p>Immediatlie then, being aduertised whereabout Makduffe went, he came hastily with a great
power into Fife, and foorthwith besieged the castell where Makduffe dwelled, trusting to
haue found him therein. They that kept the house, without anie resistance opened the
gates, and suffered him to enter, mistrusting none euill. But neuerthelesse Makbeth most
<note place="marg">Makbeths crueltie vsed against Makduffs familie.</note>
cruellie caused the wife and children of Makduffe, with all other whom he found in that
castell, to be slaine. Also he confiscated the goods of Makduffe, proclamed him traitor, and
confined him out of all the parts of his realme; but Makduffe was alreadie escaped out of
danger, and gotten into England vnto Malcolme Cammore, to trie what purchase h&eacute;e might

<note place="marg">Makduffe escapeth into England vnto Malcolme Commore.</note>

<note place="marg">Makduffes words vnto Malcolme.</note>
children, and other friends. At his comming vnto Malcolme, he declared into what great
miserie the estate of Scotland was brought, by the detestable cruelties exercised by the tyrant
Makbeth, hauing committed manie horrible slaughters and murders, both as well of the nobles
as commons, for the which he was hated right mortallie of all his liege people, desiring
nothing more than to be deliuered of that intollerable and most heauie yoke of thraldome,
which they susteined at such a caitifes hands.</p>
<p>Malcolme hearing Makduffes woords, which he vttered in verie lamentable sort, for m&eacute;ere
compassion and verie ruth that pearsed his sorowfull hart, bewailing the miserable state of
his countrie, he fetched a deepe sigh; which Makduffe perceiuing, began to fall most
<note place="marg">Malcolme sigheth.</note>
earnestlie in hand with him, to enterprise the deliuering of the Scotish people out of the
hands of so cruell and bloudie a tyrant, as Makbeth by too manie plaine experiments did
shew himselfe to be: which was an easie matter for him to bring to passe, considering not
onelie the good title he had, but also the earnest desire of the people to haue some occasion
ministred, whereby they might be reuenged of those notable iniuries, which they dailie
susteined by the outragious crueltie of Makbeths misgouernance. Though Malcolme was
verie sorowfull for the oppression of his countriemen the Scots, in maner as Makduffe had
declared; yet doubting whether he were come as one that ment vnfeinedlie as he spake, or
else as sent from Makbeth to betraie him, he thought to haue some further triall, and therevpon dissembling his mind at the first, he answered as followeth.</p>
<p>"I am trulie verie sorie for the miserie chanced to my countrie of Scotland, but though
<note place="marg">Malcolme Cammore his answer.</note>
I haue neuer so great affection to relieue the same, yet by reason of certeine incurable vices,
which reigne in me, I am nothing m&eacute;et thereto. First, such immoderate lust and voluptuous
sensualitie (the abhominable founteine of all vices) followeth me, that if I were made king of
Scots, I should s&eacute;eke to defloure your maids and matrones, in such wise that mine intemperancie should be more importable vnto you, than the bloudie tyrannie of Makbeth now is."
H&eacute;erevnto Makduffe answered: "This suerlie is a verie euill fault, for manie noble princes and
<note place="marg">Makduffes answer.</note>
kings haue lost both liues and kingdomes for the same; neuerthelesse there are women enow
in Scotland, and therefore follow my counsell. Make thy selfe king, and I shall conueie
the matter so wiselie, that thou shalt be so satisfied at thy pleasure in such secret wise, that no
man shall be aware thereof."</p>
<p>Then said Malcolme, "I am also the most auaritious creature on the earth, so that if I were
king, I should s&eacute;ke so manie waies to get lands and goods, that I would slea the most part of all
the nobles of Scotland by surmized accusations, to the end I might inioy their lands, goods, and
possessions; and therefore to shew you what mischiefe may insue on you through mine vnsatiable couetousnes, I will rehearse vnto you a fable. There was a fox hauing a sore place
<note place="marg">A fable of a fox.</note>
on him ouerset with a swarme of flies, that continuallie sucked out hir bloud: and when one
that came by and saw this manner, demanded whether she would haue the flies driuen beside
hir, she answered no: for if these flies that are alreadie full, and by reason thereof sucke not
verie egerlie, should be chased awaie, other that are emptie and fellie an hungred, should light
in their places, and sucke out the residue of my bloud farre more to my greeuance than these,
which now being satisfied doo not much annoie me. Therefore saith Malcolme, suffer me
to remaine where I am, least if I atteine to the regiment of your realme, mine vnquenchable
auarice may prooue such; that ye would thinke the displeasures which now grieue you,
should s&eacute;eme easie in respect of the vnmeasurable outrage, which might insue through my
comming amongst you."</p>
<p>Makduffe to this made answer, "how it was a far woorse fault than the other: for 
<note place="marg">Couetousnesse the root of all mischiefe.</note>
auarice is the root of all mischiefe, and for that crime the most part of our kings haue
b&eacute;ene slaine and brought to their finall end. Yet notwithstanding follow my counsell, and
take vpon th&eacute;e the crowne. There is gold and riches inough in Scotland to satisfie thy gr&eacute;edie
desire." Then said Malcolme againe, "I am furthermore inclined to dissimuiation, telling of
<note place="marg">Dissimulation and deliting in lies.</note>
leasings, and all other kinds of deceit, so that I naturallie reioise in nothing so much, as to

betraie &amp; deceiue such as put anie trust or confidence in my woords. Then sith there is nothing
that more becommeth a prince than constancie, veritie, truth, and iustice, with the other laudable fellowship of those faire and noble vertues which are comprehended onelie in soothfastnesse, and that lieng vtterlie ouerthroweth the same; you s&eacute;e how vnable I am to gouerne
anie prouince or region: and therefore sith you haue remedies to cloke and hide all the rest
of my other vices, I praie you find shift to cloke this vice amongst the residue."</p>
<p>Then said Makduffe; "This yet is the woorst of all, and there Lleaue thee, and therefore
saie; Oh ye vnhappie and miserable Scotishmen, which are thus scourged with so manie and
<note place="marg">Makduffes exclamation.</note>
sundrie calamities, ech one aboue other! Ye haue one curssed and wicked tyrant that now
reigneth ouer you, without anie right or title, oppressing you with his most bloudiecrueltie. This
other that hath the right to the crowne, is so replet with the inconstant behauiour and manifest vices of Englishmen, that he is nothing woorthie to inioy it: for by his owne confession
he is not onelie auaritious, and giuen to vnsatiable lust, but so false a traitor withall, that no
trust is to be had vnto anie woord he speaketh. Adieu Scotland, for now I account my selfe
a banished man for euer, without comfort or consolation." and with those woords the
<note place="marg">Makduffe w&eacute;epeth.</note>
brackish teares trickled downe his ch&eacute;ekes verie abundantlie.</p>
<p>At the last, when he was readie to depart, Malcolme tooke him by the sl&eacute;eue, and said:
"Be of good comfort Makduffe, for I haue none of these vices before remembred, but haue
<note place="marg">Malcolme comforteth Makduffe.</note>
iested with th&eacute;e in this manner, onelie to prooue thy mind: for diuerse times h&eacute;eretofore
hath Makbeth sought by this manner of meanes to bring me into his hands, but the more
slow I haue shewed my selfe to condescend to thy motion and request, the more 
<note place="marg">Makduffe &amp; Malcolme imbrace ech other.</note>
diligence shall I vse in accomplishing the same." Incontinentlie h&eacute;erevpon they imbraced
ech other, and promising to be faithfull the one to the other, they fell in consultation how they
might best prouide for all their businesse, to bring the same to good effect. Soone after,
Makduffe repairing to the borders of Scotland, addressed his letters with secret dispatch vnto
<note place="marg">Makduffe writeth letters to his friends in Scotland.</note>
thenobles of the realme, declaring how Malcolme was confederat with him, to come hastilie vnto
Scotland to claime the crowne, and therefore he required them, sith he was right inheritor thereto,
to assist him with their powers to recouer the same out of the hands of the wrongfull vsurper.</p>
<p>In the meane time, Malcolme purchased such fauor at king Edwards hands, that old 
<note place="marg">Siward earle of Northumberland.</note>
Siward earle of Northumberland was appointed with ten thousand men to go with him into
Scotland, to support him in this enterprise, for recouerie of his right. After these newes were
spread abroad in Scotland, the nobles drew into two seuerall factions, the one taking part with
<note place="marg">The nobles of Scotland diuided.</note>
Makbeth, and the other with Malcolme. H&eacute;erevpon insued oftentimes sundrie bickerings, &amp;
diuerse light skirmishes: for those that were of Malcolmes side, would not ieopard to ioine
with their enimies in a pight field, till his comming out of England to their support. But after that Makbeth perceiued his enimies power to increase, by such aid as came to them foorth
of England with his aduersarie Malcolme, he recoiled backe into Fife, there purposing to
<note place="marg">Makbeth recoileth.</note>
abide in campe fortified, at the castell of Dunsinane, and to fight with his enimies, if they ment
to pursue him; howbeit some of his friends aduised him, that it should be best for him,
either to make some agr&eacute;ement with Malcolme, or else to fl&eacute;e with all sp&eacute;ed into the Iles, and
<note place="marg">Makbeth is counselled to fl&eacute;e into the Iles.</note>
to take his treasure with him, to the end he might wage sundrie great princes of the realme to
take his part, &amp; reteine strangers, in whome he might better trust than in his owne subiects,
which stale dailie from him: but he had such confidence in his prophesies, that he bel&eacute;eued he
<note place="marg">Makbeths trust in prophesies.</note>
should neuer be vanquished, till Birnane wood were brought to Dunsinane; nor yet to be
slaine with anie man, that should be or was borne of anie woman.</p>
<p>Malcolme following hastilie after Makbeth, came the night before the battell vnto Birrane
wood, and when his armie had rested a while there to refresh them, he commanded euerie
man to get a bough of some tr&eacute;e or other of that wood in his hand, as big as he might beare,
<note place="marg">Branches of tr&eacute;es.</note>
and to march foorth therewith in such wise, that on the next morrow they might come
closelie and without sight in this manner within view of his enimies. On the morrow when
Makbeth beheld them comming in this sort, he first maruelled what the matter ment, but in
the end remembred himselfe that the prophesie which he had heard long before that time, of

<note place="marg">Makbeth setteth his men in order of battell.</note>

<note place="marg">Makbeth fleeth, &amp; is pursued of Makduffe.</note>
Neuerthelesse, he brought his men in order of battell, and exhorted them to doo valiantlie, howbeit
his enimies had scarselie cast from them their boughs, when Makbeth perceiuing their
numbers, betooke him streict to flight, whom Makduffe pursued with great hatred euen
till he came vnto Lunfannaine, where Makbeth perceiuing that Makduffe was hard at his
backe, leapt beside his horsse, sieng; "Thou traitor, what meaneth it that thou shouldest
thus in vaine follow me that am not appointed to be slaine by anie creature that is borne of a
woman, come on therefore, and receiue thy reward which thou hast deserued for thy paines,"
and tnerwithall he lifted vp his swoord thinking to haue slaine him.</p>
<p>But Makduffe quicklie auoiding from his horsse, yer he came at him, answered (with his
naked swoord in his hand) saieng: "It is true Makbeth, and row shall thine insatiable crueltie haue an end, for I am euen he that thy wizzards haue told th&eacute;e of, who was neuer borne
of my mother, but ripped out of her wombe:" therewithall he stept vnto him, and slue him
<note place="marg">Makbeth is slaine.</note>
in the place. Then cutting his head from his shoulders, he set it vpon a pole, and brought
it vnto Malcolme. This was the end of Makbeth, after he had reigned 17 yeeres ouer the
Scotishmen. In the beginning of his reigne he accomplished manie woorthie acts, verie profitable to the common-wealth (as ye haue heard) but afterward by illusion of the diuell, he defamed the same with most terrible crueltie. He was slaine in the y&eacute;ere of the incarnation,

Edward, in the 16 yeere of the same Edwards reigne, he was crowned at Scone the 25 day
of Aprill, in the y&eacute;ere of our Lord 1057. Immediatlie after his coronation he called a 
<note place="marg">A parlemen at Forfair.</note>
parlement at Forfair, in the which he rewarded them with lands and liuings that had assisted him
against Makbeth, aduancing them to f&eacute;es and offices as he saw cause, &amp; commanded that speciallie those that bare the surname of anie offices or lands, should haue and 'noy the same. He
created manie earles, lords, barons, and knights. Manie of them that before were thanes,
<note place="marg">Thanes changed into earles.</note>
were at this time made earles, as Fife, Mentetl, Atholl, Leuenox, Murrey, Cathnes, Rosse,
and Angus. These were the first earles that haue beene heard of amongst the Scotishmen (as
their histories doo make mention.) Manie new surnames were taken vp at this time amongst

owners for the time. Others got their surnames by offices, as Steward, Durward, and Banerman. Also the proper names of manie valiant capteins were turned into generall surnames,
as Kennedie, Graham, Haie, with diuerse other too long h&eacute;ere to rehearse. So that it came
to passe then, as it hath doone manie times since, that new surnames haue worne the old out

manie holesome ordinances established, both apperteining to ciuill administration, and also to

third, that the linage of Makduffe should inioy regall authoritie and power within all their
lands and roomes, as to appoint officers and iudges for the hearing and determining of all matters and controuersies (treason onelie excepted) and that if anie of their men or tenants were

called to answer in anie court out of their circuit, they might appeale to their owne hidges to
be appointed, as before is expressed.</p>
<p>Iohannes Maior writeth in his chronicles, that the third priuilege, which Malcolme granted
<note place="marg"><emph>Iohannes Maior.</emph></note>
vnto this Makduffe and his posteritie, was this, that for euerie gentleman that anie of
them should hap to kill by chancemedlie, and not vpon pretensed malice, for the summe of
24 marks he should redeeme his punishment due for the same: &amp; for the casuall slaughter of a meaner person he should be fined at twelue marks. So that murtherers were woont
to say, that if they were able to paie that summe to the Kinboc, they ought to be released of further punishment, by Makduffes priuilege. But this third priuilege, togither with the other
two former grants, the said Maior sore reprooueth, and not without cause, as may app&eacute;ere,
considering the naturall inclination of that people vnto murther, which by this meanes nourishing secret hatred and malice in their harts, might vnder the cloke of casuall falling out,
slea whom they listed.</p>
<p>It was ordeined also at this parlement, that barons which had liberties within themselues,
should make gibbets, whereon men that deserued death should suffer execution: and also 
<note place="marg">Gibbets and draw-wels.</note>
draw-wels, wherein women that were condemned should be drowned, according to the order of the
ciuill lawes vsed in Scotland. Moreouer, all the lawes that Makbeth had ordeined, were
<note place="marg">Makbeths lawes abrogated.</note>

<note place="marg">Lugtake.</note>
abrogated at this parlement. Thus whilest Malcolme was busied in setting orders amongst his
subiects, tidings came that one Lugtake surnamed the foole, being either the sonne, or (as
some write) the coosen of the late mentioned Makbeth, was conueied with a great number of
such as had taken part with the said Makbeth vnto Scone, and there by their support receiued
<note place="marg">Lugtake crowned at Scone.</note>
the crowne, as lawfull inheritor thereto. To appease this businesse, was Makduffe earle of
Fife sent with full commission in the kings name, who incountring with Lugtake at a village
called Essen in Bogdale, slue him, and discomfited his whole power, ordering the 
<note place="marg">Lugtake is slaine.</note>
matter with them in such wise, that afterwards there was no more trouble attempted in that
behalfe.</p>
<p>After this, the realme continued in peace certeine yeeres, till it chanced a great number of
<note place="marg">A band of th&eacute;eues.</note>
th&eacute;eues and robbers assembling themselues togither at Cocbourne pethes, did much hurt, by
robbing and spoiling the people in the countries of Mers and Louthian: howbeit, at length
one Patrike Dunbar of Dunbar, by commandement of the king, fought with them, slue their
<note place="marg">Patrike Dunbar vanquisheth the th&eacute;eues and robbers of the countrie.</note>
capteine, with six hundred of his companie, and tooke fourescore prisoners, the which he
caused to be hanged. And thus hauing deliuered the countrie of those p&eacute;elers, with losse of
fortie of his owne men, he returned to the king, with the head of the capteine of that rout:
so that for his manhood h&eacute;erein shewed, he was made by the king earle of March, and for
<note place="marg">Patrike Dunbar earle of March.</note>
the maintenance of his estate, had the lands of Cockbourne Pethes giuen to him and his heires
for euer, vpon this condition, that in times comming, the earles of March should purge Mers
and Louthian of all th&eacute;eues and robbers. In memorie whereof, he was commanded to beare
<note place="marg">The head of a th&eacute;efe or fellon giuen in arms.</note>

<note place="marg">A conspiracie.</note>
in his armes a fellons head sprinkled with bloud.</p>
<p>Shortlie after he got knowledge, how there were certeine gentlemen that had conspired to
slea him, &amp; therefore taking occasion to go on hunting, where this act should haue b&eacute;ene executed, he calleth the chiefe author of the conspiracie apart into a certeine vallie, which was
closed on euerie side with thicke woods, and there brake the matter vnto him, in reprouing
him verie sharpelie, for that he had so traitorouslie conspired his death, whose preseruation he
ought chieflie to haue wished, considering the manifold benefits he had receiued at his hands.
And herewith leaping from his horsse, drew his swoord, commanding the other likewise to
<note place="marg">The manlie courage of K. Malcolme.</note>
draw his, that now hauing conuenient time and place thereto, they might trie the matter betwixt them, who should be thought most woorthie of life, by open force of knightlie prowesse. The conspirator hearing these woords, as a man altogither astonished, fell downe vpon
his knees at the kings f&eacute;et; beseeching his grace of mercie for his wicked purpose and heinous
offense: who s&eacute;eing him thus penitent, bad him arise, and said; "I am content h&eacute;erevpon to
forgiue thee, so that thou be not of counsell heereafter in anie such traitorous practise."</p>

<p>Whilest things passed thus in Scotland, great and maruellous chances came to passe within
the realme of England. For after the death of king Edward, surnamed the Confessor,
Harold the sonne of earle Goodwine tooke on him the kingdome. But William bastard duke
<note place="marg">S&eacute;e more herof in England.</note>
of Normandie, pretending title to the crowne of England, at length inuaded the land, and
sleaing Harold in field, made a full conquest of the realme, and was crowned king at London
by Eldred archbishop of Yorke. H&eacute;ere ye haue to vnderstand, that king Edward in his life
time had sent for his nephue Edward, the sonne of his brother Edmund Ironside, to come
home foorth of Hungarie, whither (after his fathers deceasse) he and his brother Edwine had
b&eacute;ene sent awaie, as in the historie of England it app&eacute;ereth more at large. This Edward had
<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>
married the daughter of the emperor Henrie, named Agatha, sister to the qu&eacute;ene of Hungarie, and not the king of Hungaries daughter, although the Scotish writers doo so affirme.
By hir he had issue a sonne named Edgar, and two daughters, the one named Margaret and
the other Christen.</p>
<p>King Edward ment that his nephue the said Edward should haue succeeded him, and (as
<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boet.</emph></note>
some write) he would in his life time haue resigned the crowne vnto him. But he (a thing
woorthie of admiration) vtterlie refused it, and would not once meddle therewith during his
vncles life time; &amp; (as it chanced) he died, whilest his vncle king Edward was yet liuing. His
sonne Edgar therefore, to whom it s&eacute;emed that the crowne was due, when he saw the realme
conquered by the Normans, despairing to recouer it out of their hands, got a ship, and determined with his mother and sisters to passe ouer into Germanie to his friends and kinsfolke
there: but by contrarie winds he was driuen to shore in the Forth, at a place called vnto this
day the queenes ferrie. Malcolme being at the same time at Dunfermeling, when he heard
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;enes ferrie.</note>
of the arriuall of this ship, and vnderstood what they were that were aboord in hir, he resorted
thither with an honorable companie about him, to visit them for honors sake, vpon fauour he
bare towards them, for that they were descended of that noble prince king Edward, in whome
afore time he had found so much gentlenesse and friendship.</p>
<p>Finallie, when he vnderstood their estate, he brought them home with him to his palace,
shewing them all the loue and friendship he could deuise; and in the end considering the excellent beutie, wisdome, and noble qualities of the ladie Margaret, sister to the same Edgar, he
<note place="marg">Malcolme Cammore marieth Margaret sister to Edgar Achelling.</note>

<note place="marg">1067. <emph>H.B.</emph></note>
required of Agatha hir mother to haue hir in mariage, wherevnto Agatha gladlie condescended. Shortlie after, with an assemblie of all the nobles of Scotland, this mariage was made and
solemnized after the octaues of Easter, in the yeare 1067, with all the ioy &amp; triumph that
might be deuised. K. William conqueror of England, being informed hereof, feared least this aliance betwixt Malcolme and Edgar might br&eacute;ed some trouble and disquietnesse to his estate, sith
the same Edgar had manie friends through all the parties of England. To preuent therefore the occasions of intestine troubles, he confined all the linage of the foresaid Edgar, by reason whereof, a great number of Englishmen came into Scotland vnto king Malcolme, and
<note place="marg">Englishmen fled into Scotland.</note>
manie of them obteining liuings at his hands, remained there continuallie during their liues,
leauing to their posteritie their names &amp; possessions. Amongst whome were these, Lindseie,
<note place="marg">Surnames of Englishmen in Scotland.</note>
Vaus, Ramseie, Louell, Towhris, Prestoune, Sandlands, Bissart, Sewlis, Wardlaw, Maxwell,
with diuerse other.</p>
<p>There came diuerse also out of Hungarie with qu&eacute;ene Margaret, who likewise left their
names to their families, which yet remaine euen vnto this day, as Creichtoune, Fotringham,
<note place="marg">Surnames of Hungarians.</note>
Giffart, Meluill, Borthwike, and others. Also there haue come at sundrie seasons out of

Mountgummerie, Campbell, Bois, Betoun, or Betuin, Taillefer, and Bothwell, besides sundrie other
which were but superfluous to rehearse at this time. &para; But to the order of the historie. It
is recorded by writers, that these (which at this time came out of England vnto Edgar) brought
great quantitie of gold and siluer with them; also manie relikes of saints, and (amongst other)

William the conqueror sent an herald at armes vnto king Malcolme, demanding to haue 
<note place="marg">William conqueror threatneth king Malcolme.</note>
Edgar deliuered into his hands, and threatning that if he refused to deliuer him, he would suerlie fetch him, and that smallie for Malcolms commoditie.</p>
<p>But Malcolme, though he vnderstood that he should be sure of wars at K. Williams hands

<note place="marg">Malcolms enterprise against his enimies.</note>
vnreasonable, &amp; therefore he minded not in anie wise to gratifie him therein. King William receiuing
this answere from king Malcolme, proclamed open warre against Scotland. In the meane time
all Northumberland tooke part with K. Malcolme, for that he was their earles sisters sonne.
Wherevpon K. William sent a valiant capteine, a Norman borne named Roger, to inuade
Northumberland. Which Roger gathering a power of men, came hastilie into that countrie,
howbeit he abode a short time there in honor, for by the Scots &amp; Northumberland men his
armie was discomfited, and he himselfe traitorouslie slaine by hisowne souldiers.</p>
<p>But king William nothing discouraged with this ouerthrow: sent one Richard earle of Glocester (whome amongest all the Englishmen he had most in trust) with a mightie armie into
Cumberland, against whome were sent the earles of March and Menteith, who defended the
countrie right manlie from the inuasion of the said earle, so that he was not able to take anie
aduantage of them. King William aduertised hereof, waxed woonderfull wroth, that no more
good was doone against his enimies,wherevpon he sent a new power thither withall sp&eacute;ed, vnder
the leading of his brother Odo, who was both bishop of Baieux, and earle of Kent. By this
last armie, the countrie of Northumberland was sore spoiled, and a great number both of Scots
and Northumberlandmen discomfited and slaine. But as Odo was preparing to returne, there
came Malcolme, with all the power he might make, and giuing an onset vpon his enimies,
alue a great number of them, and recouered all the bootie which Odos men had got in the
countrie, and so right ioifull of that victorie, returned into Scotland. King William yet 
<note place="marg">Robert the sonne of William conquerour.</note>
nothing abashed for these mishaps, sent his sonne called Robert, with a far greater power than
at anie time he had sent before, into Northumberland, who remaining a long season in campe
n&eacute;ere to the riuer of Tine, attempted no notable enterprise, sauing that he repared and newlie
fortified the towne of Newcastell, which standeth vpon the same riuer of Tine; and then at

<note place="marg">A peace concluded betwixt William Conquerour, and Malcolme Cammore.</note>

<note place="marg">The roicrosse.</note>

<note place="marg">Waltheof.</note>

<note place="marg">Siward earle of Northumberland.</note>
length a peace was concluded betwixt the two kings vnder these conditions, that king
Malcolme should inioy that part of Northumberland which lieth betwixt Tw&eacute;ed, Cumberland, and Stainmoore, and to doo homage to the K. of England for the same. In the
midst of Stainmoore there shall be a crosse set vp, with the king of Englands image on the one
side, and the king of Scotlands on the other, to signifie that the one is march to England, and
the other to Scotland. This crosse was called the roicrosse, that is, the crosse of the kings.
Moreouer, it was concluded that Waltheof or Voldosius (as the Scotish writers name him) the
sonne of Siward earle of Northumberland should marie king Williams n&eacute;ece, borne of
his daughter, and to be fr&eacute;e from all paiments and exactions due to the king by anie maner
of prerogatiue or means, for the space of twentie yeares next insuing.</p>
<p>In the necke of this peace thus concluded betwixt the kings, happened new trouble in
<note place="marg">Rebellion in Galloway.</note>
Scotland, by reason of intestine rebellion: for the people of Galloway, and the Iland men,
rose in great numbers, and spoiled the borders of their neighbors, not sparing from slaughter
in all parts, where they were anie thing resisted. Against these rebels was sent by king 
<note place="marg">Walter the sonne of Fleance.</note>
Malcolme, Walter the sonne of Fleance (of whome there is mention made before) with a conuenient armie, who at his comming into Galloway, first gaue the people of that countrie
an ouerthrow, and slue their chiefe capteine Makglaue. Then afterwards fighting with them
<note place="marg">Makglaue.</note>
of the Iles, he subdued them in such wise, that all things were pacified euen at commandement. For which high prowes and diligence in this p&eacute;ece of seruice shewed, he was created
<note place="marg">Walter created high steward of Scotland.</note>
by Malcolme high steward of the realme, so that afterwards both he and his posteritie euer since
haue borne that surname, euen vnto these our daies.</p>
<p>After the quieting of this businesse, there sprang a new tumult more dangerous than the 
<note place="marg">A new rebellion in Murrey land.</note>
former, for the Murreyland men, procuring them of Rosse and Cathnes, with diuers other to ioine

vnder him to see iustice ministred, but thro&uacute;gh support of one Makduncane, whome they
chose to be their capteine, they also wasted and destroied the kings possessions, with more
crueltie than euer had b&eacute;ene heard of before. Wherefore to punish these traitorous attempts,
Makduffe was sent with an armie into Mar. But the traitors doubting least they should not
<note place="marg">Makduffe.</note>
be able to withstand his puissance, thought nothing more auailable than to stop him with monie: but in the meane time came the king himselfe in good season into Monimuske, where he
was aduerised, that in maner all the north parts of Scotland with the Iles, were confederat with
the Murreyland men against him. The king astonished something at these newes, vowed to giue
<note place="marg">The kings vow.</note>
the baronnie of Monimuske (which he vnderstood to be lands perteining to the crowne) vnto the
church of saint Andrew in Fife, if it might please God to send him victorie ouer his enimies.</p>
<p>At length comming vnto the water of Speie, he beheld his enimies on the further side, in
greater number, and in better furniture for armor than he thought had b&eacute;ene possible to haue
found in all Scotland: he perceiued also that his standard-bearer began to shrinke, and not to
<note place="marg">Standard bearer.</note>
shew the like cheerefull countenance as he ought to haue doone. Wherefore he pulled the
banner from him, and gaue it to sir Alexander Carron, who with this his new office obteined
<note place="marg">Sir Alexander Carron.</note>
sundrie faire lands and possessions, to him and to his heires for euer: but his surname was afterwards changed, and called Skrimgeour; of the which is descended a noble house, continuing
yet in great honor in the same surname and office. When the king was once passed the water,
and the armies on both sides readie to haue ioined, through mediation of bishops and other vertuous men, the matter was taken vp, and peace made on these conditions; That the commons
<note place="marg">A peace concluded.</note>

<note place="marg">The submission of gentlemen.</note>
that tooke part with the rebels, should returne home out of hand, and the gentlemen to submit
themselues to the kings pleasure, their liues and lands saued. Howbeit manie of them were
kept in perpetuall prison during their liues, and all their goods confiscated to the kings vse.</p>
<p>All ciuill trouble and commotion being thus quieted, king Malcolme (speciallie by the
good admonishment and exhortation of his wife qu&eacute;ene Margaret, a woman of great zeale
<note place="marg">King Malcolme through exhortation of his wife, giueth himselfe to deuotion.</note>

and workes of mercie; as in dooing of almes d&eacute;eds, by prouiding for the poore, and
such like godlie exercises: so that in true vertue he was thought to excell all other
princes of his time. To be briefe, herein there s&eacute;emed to be in maner a certeine strife
<note place="marg">A godlie strife.</note>
betwixt him, and that vertuous qu&eacute;ene his wife, which of them should be most feruent in the

Agatha and hir daughter Christine, also by the example of these two holie liuers, renounced
<note place="marg">Agatha and Christine renounce the world.</note>
the pompe of the court, and got them to a priuat and solitarie life, wherein they gaue themselues wholie to diuine contemplation. Furthermore, Malcolme by the setting on of the
queene his wife, ceassed not to set his indeuor wholie to the aduancement of the christian religion, and to restore things that were decaied by the negligence of his predecessors. There.
fore whereas before his time, there were but foure bishops s&eacute;es in Scotland, as saint Andrews,
Glascow, Galloway, and Murthlake, and two of them, that is to say, saint Andrews and Murthlake remaining onelie in good reparation (the other being decaied) he restored the other two

<note place="marg">Riot and superfluous chere brought into Scotland.</note>
to their former beauties, and furthermore erected two other of new, as Murrey and Cathnes,

<p>But to proc&eacute;ed. It is said, that such outragious riot entered at this time, and began to grow
in vse among the Scotishmen, togither with the language and maners of the English nation (by
reason that such a multitude of the same, flieng out of their countrie, were dailie receiued as
then into Scotland to inhabit there, as before is shewed) that diuerse of the nobles perceiuing
what discommoditie and decaie to the whole realme would insue of this intemperance, came

to the king, lamenting greeuouslie the case, for that this venemous infection spred so fast
ouer the whole realme, to the peruerting and vtter remooting of the ancient sobrietie of diet
vsed in the same. Wherefore they besought him to prouide some remedie in time, before
hope of redresse were past, that the people might be againe reduced vnto their former frugalitie, who hitherto vsed not to eat but once in the day, and then desiring no superfluous meates
and drinks to be sought by sea and land, nor curiouslie dressed or serued foorth with sawces,
but onelie feeding to satisfie nature, and not their gr&eacute;edie appetites.</p>

<p>Through this their sober fare, with the exercising of their bodies herewith in continull
<note place="marg">Sober fare cause of strength and hugenesse of bodie.</note>
trauell, they grew more strong and greater of bodie, than their of spring are found to be in

with great and huge bodies, mightie armes and lims, pressing vpon their enimies like vnto
fierce lions, bearing downe all before them, without dread of anie danger, for that they exc&eacute;eded all humane strength and power. Herevpon king Malcolme tooke great paines to
haue redressed this infectiue poison, and vtterlie to haue expelled it foorth of his reaime.
Howbeit the nature of man is so prone and readie to imbrace all kinds of vice, that where
<note place="marg">Mans nature prone to vice.</note>
the Scotish people before had no knowledge nor vnderstanding of fine fare or riotous surfet;
yet after they had once tasted the sw&eacute;et poisoned bait thereof, there was now no meane to

superfluities (which came into the realme of Scotland with the Englishmen) planted therein
by the daies of king Malcolme, are not to be compared in excesse with things vsed in our

superfluities, as it is now adaies; for then though they were gone from the ancient sparenesse of diet, they yet did not eat past twise a day, and had but two dishes at a meale: but

was made bishop of saint Andrews, and wrote the liues of queene Margaret and Malcolme

great noise and clamour vnto the kings tent. Who hearing the noise, came foorth of his

Donald had receiued the crowne at the abbele of Scone, he perceiued that some of the nobles

puissance, in purpose to haue giuen battell, the most part of his people did forsake him, and
drew vnto Duncans side, so that Donald thus abandoned of them that should haue aided

<p>Donald Bane being aduertised of all those things, that thereby happened in Scotland,

was so farre out of the peoples fauor, that more reioised than were sorie for his death.
After he was thus dispatched, his vncle Donald was restored againe to the kingdome,

with a competent armie, and apprehending the chiefe authors and capteins, stroke off their
heads. As he returned backe through Mernes, there came a woman vnto him w&eacute;eping in

the partie wronged, according to the value of his losse and hinderance, with the goods of
the iudge that pronounced the iudgement.</p>
<p>Thus in the first years of his reigne he did manie things to the aduancement of the

the example of the Englishmen, perceiuing the same to br&eacute;ed a great weakening &amp; decaie
of the ancient stoutnesse of stomach, that was woont to remaine in the Scotish nation. He
builded to the number of fift&eacute;ene abbeies, part of them in the beginning of his reigne
<note place="marg">King Dauid built 15 abbeies.</note>

<note place="marg">The names of the abbeies builded by king Dauid.</note>

warres were ended. The names of those abbeies are as followeth: Holie rood house, Kelso,
Iedburgh, Melrosse, Newbottell, Holmecultrane, Dundranane, Cambuskenneth, Kinlois,
Dunfirmling, Holme in Cumberland; also two nunries, the one at Carleill, and the other
at north Berwike: with two abbeies beside Newcastell, the one of saint Benedicts order,
and the other of white moonkes. He erected also foure bishoprikes within his realme, Rosse,
<note place="marg">Foure bishops s&eacute;es erected in Scotland.</note>
Brechin, Dunkeld, and Dublane, indowing them with rich rents, faire lands, and sundrie
right commodious possessions. Moreouer he translated the bishops see of Murthlake vnto
Aberden, for sundrie aduised considerations, augmenting it with certeine reuenues, as he
thought expedient.</p>
<p>He was admonished (as the report goeth) in his sleepe, that he shuld build an abbeie for
a religious order to liue in togither. Whervpon he sent for woorkemen into France and
Flanders, and set them in hand to build this abbeie of canons regular, as he was admonished,

<note place="marg">60000 pounds in lands giuen to the church.</note>

<note place="marg">Superfluous possessions of the church.</note>
b&eacute;ene thus inriched, and the crowne impouerished.</p>
<p>Therefore king lames the first, when he came to king Dauid his sepulture at Dunfirmling,
he said, that he was a sore saint for the crowne, meaning that he left the church ouer-rich,
and the crowne too poore. For he tooke from the crowne (as Iohn Maior writeth in his
chronicles) 60 thousand pounds Scotish of y&eacute;erelie reuenues, wherewith he indowed those
abbeies. But if K. Dauid had considered how to nourish true religion, he had neither indowed churches with such riches, nor built them with such roialtie: for the superfluous
possessions of the church (as they are now vsed) are not onelie occasion to euill prelats to
liue in most insolent pompe &amp; corrupt life, but an assured net to draw gold and siluer out
of realms. But now to returne where I left, touching the historie, ye shall note that (as I
said before) Dauid had by his wife Mauld inheritor of part of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Huntington, a sonne named Henrie, who maried the earle of Warrens daughter,
<note place="marg">Earle of Warren.</note>
a ladie of high parentage, as descended of most noble bloud both French and English. On
whome he begat thr&eacute;e sonnes, Malcolme, William, and Dauid; also thr&eacute;e daughters, 
<note place="marg">The issue of Henrie.</note>
Adhama, Margaret, and Mauld. But now in the meane time, whilest the estate of the common-wealth in Scotland stood in high felicitie, vnder the prosperous gouernement of king
Dauid, there happened to him an heauie losse. For the qu&eacute;ene his wife the foresaid Mauld
<note place="marg">Qu&eacute;ene Mauld deceasseth.</note>
deceassed in hir flourishing age, a woman of passing beautie and chastitie, which two points
(as is thought) commend a woman aboue all the rest. King Dauid therefore tooke such
griefe for hir death, that he would neuer after giue his mind to marie anie other, but passed
the residue of his life without companie of all women. She was buried in Scone, in the
yeare of our Lord God 1132.</p>
<note place="marg"><date>1132.</date></note>
<p>Whilest these things came thus to passe in Scotland, Henrie Beauclerke king of England,
caused all the nobles of his realme to take their oths, that after his deceasse they should
receiue his daughter Mauld the empresse for their souereigne ladie and qu&eacute;ene. She was
<note place="marg">Mauld the empresse.</note>
as then returned into England; for hir husband the emperour was latelie before deceassed.
King Dauid also tooke his oth, and therefore when king Stephan (who vsurped the crowne
<note place="marg">K. Stephan.</note>
of England after king Henries deceasse against the said empresse) sent vnto king Dauid to
<note place="marg">Homage is required.</note>
come and doo his homage for the earledoines of Northumberland, Cumberland, and Huntington (according as by his tenure he was bound to doo) with intimation that if he refused,
king Stephan would inuade him with open warre; king Dauid answered, that he had giuen
his faith once aforehand for those lands vnto the empresse Mauld, which he minded not to
breake for the threatning words of anie new inuasions. King Stephan moued with this answere, sent a power of men to the borders of Northumberland, (which as then was vnder
<note place="marg">The Englishmen inuade Northumberland.</note>
the dominion of the Scots) to make a rode vpon the inhabitants of that countrie. They
that had the charge of this enterprise, entering into the lands of their enimies, put all to
fire and sword that came in their way. The Scots kindled with that displeasure, roded into

<note place="marg">A resignation.</note>

<note place="marg">K. Stephan repenteth.</note>
England, and did the like displeasures and hurts there. For the yeare after, the earles of
March, Menteth, and Angus entred into England with a great armie, against whome came
the earle of Glocester, and giuing them battell at Northalerton, lost the field, and was taken
prisoner himselfe, with diuers other nobles of England. King Stephan therefore, constreined to red&eacute;eme the captiues, gaue not onelie a great summe of monie for them; but
also made resignation of all such title, claime, or interest, as either he or anie of his successors might make or pretend to the counties of Northumberland and Cumberland. Howbeit his nobles were no sooner returned home, but that repenting him of that resignation,
he gathered his puissance againe, and entering into Northumberland, fought with the Scots
that came foorth to resist him, and obteining the victorie, tooke a great part of the countrie
into his possession.</p>
<p>King Dauid, to redresse these iniuries, gathered a mightie armie, with deliberat mind,
either to expell the Englishmen out of all the bounds of his dominions, or else to die in
the f&eacute;eld. But shortlie after, Thurstane archbishop of Yorke came vnto Roxburgh, called

in those daies Marken, to treat for peace, where a truce was concluded for three moneths,
<note place="marg">A truce.</note>
with condition, that the Englishmen should deliuer vp the dominion of Northumberland
vnto the lord Henrie king Dauid his sonnes. But for so much as this couenant was not
performed on king Stephans side, king Dauid inuaded that part of the countrie which the
<note place="marg">King Dauid inuadeth Northumberland.</note>

<note place="marg">King Stephan passeth vnto Roxburgh.</note>
Englishmen held, making great slaughter of all them that he found there about to resist
him. King Stephan mooued herewith leuied his people, and came in puissant araie vnto
Roxburgh ; but for that he had secret knowledge that some of the nobles in his armie
sought his destruction, he was constreined to returne without atchiuing of anie woorthie enterprise.</p>
<p>The yeare next insuing, a peace was talked vpon, the archbishops of Cantuburie and
Yorke appointed commissioners in the treatie thereof on the behalfe of king Stephan, and the
bishops of Glascow, Aberden, and saint Andrews on the part of king Dauid. But Mauld
qu&eacute;ene of England, the daughter of Eustace earle of Bullongne, and n&eacute;ece to king Dauid
by his sister Marie, was the chiefest dooer in this matter, to bring them to agr&eacute;ement. The
one of the kings, that is to say Stephan, laie at Duresme with his nobles; and the other,
that is to say Dauid, lay at Newcastell, during all the time of this treatie, which at length
sorted to the conclusion of a peace, on these conditions: that the counties of 
<note place="marg">A peace.</note>
Northumberland and Huntington should remaine in the gouernement of Henrie prince of Scotland, as
heire to the same by right of his mother; but Cumberland should be reputed as the 
<note place="marg">Couenants of agre&eacute;ment.</note>
inheritance and right of his father king Dauid. And for these lands and segniories the forenamed prince Henrie &amp; his successors, princes of Scotland, should doo homage vnto king

Kent, and king Dauid repaired into Cumberland, where he fortified the towne of Carleill
with new walles and ditches. Thus passed the first thr&eacute;e yeares of king Stephans reigne,
In the fou&racute;th yeare came Mauld the empresse into England to claime the crowne thereof
(as in the English historie more plainelie may appeare.) But whilest England was sore tormented with warres by contrarie factions of the nobles for the quarels of these two persons,
no small sorrow hapned to Scotland for the death of Henrie the prince of that land, and
onelie sonne vnto king Dauid, who died at Kelso, and was buried in the abbeie church
there, in the yeare of our redemption, 1152. His death was greatlie bemoned aswell of
his father the king, as of all other the estates and degr&eacute;es of the realme, for such singular
vertue and noble conditions as appeared in him. But yet, for that he left issue behind him
<note place="marg">Prince Henrie his issue.</note>
thr&eacute;e sonnes and thr&eacute;e, daughters (as before is mentioned) the realme was not thought
vnprouided of heires.</p>
<p>The king also being mortified from the world, tooke the death of his sonne verie patientlie, considering that all men are subiect vnto death by the law of nature, and are sure
<note place="marg">The lawes of nature.</note>
no longer to remaine here, than their day appointed by the eternall determination of him that
giueth and taketh away life &amp; breath when it pleaseth him, as by dailie experience is most
manifest. Therefore that king Dauid weied the losse of his sonne in such balance, it may
appeare by an oration which he made to his nobles, at what time (after his sonnes deceasse) they came to comfort him. For he perceiuing them to be right heauie and sorrowfull for the losse which he and they had susteined by the death of so towardlie a prince, that
was to haue succ&eacute;eded him, if God had lent him life thereto; in the end of a roiall feast,
the which he made vnto those nobles that came thus to visit him, he began in this wise.</p>
<p>"How great your fidelitie and care is, which you beare towards me, although oftentimes
<note place="marg">An oration.</note>

sonne, than if you had buried some one of your owne sonnes, and are therefore come to
your great trauell and paine to comfort me, whome you est&eacute;eme to be sore afflicted for the
ouer-timelie death of my said most obedient sonne. But to let passe for this time dae

this now may suffice, that I acknowledge my selfe to be so much beholden to you, that
whatsoeuer thing I haue in the world, the same is readie to doo you pleasure. But concerning the cause of your comming hither, in shewing your courtesies therein, you shall vnderstand, that my parents, whom I trust to be in heauen, and (as saints) inioy the fruits of their
vertuous trauels here taken on earth, did so instruct me from my tender youth, that I should
woorship with all reuerence the most wise creator and prudent gouernor of all things; and
to thinke that nothing was doone by him in vaine, but that the same is prouided and ordeined to some good vse by his high and unsearchable counsell. And therefore whilest day
and night I haue and doo reuolue and call to remembrance the precepts and instructions of
my parents, whatsoeuer hath chanced either tuching aduersitie or prosperitie, good hap or
<note place="marg">His parents godlie instructions.</note>
bad, the same hath s&eacute;emed to me (at the first) receiuing all things with equall and thankefull
mind, and interpreting them to the best, farre more light than they commonlie s&eacute;eme to others;
and lesse they did disquiet me: so as with vse I haue learned at length, not onelie patientlie to
beare all aduersities that may happen, but also to receiue the same as things pleasant and
euen to be desired. And verelie my hap hath beene to be greatlie exercised in this behalfe,
for I haue first seene my father, more d&eacute;ere to me than anie earthlie treasure; and no lesse
<note place="marg">Losse of friends.</note>

<note place="marg">His father.</note>
profitable than greatlie desired of all the people; and yet neither the loue of the people, nor of
his kinsmen and friends might warrant him from this fatall necessitie of death. I haue knowen
my mother right famous in the world for hir singular vertue to passe hence in like maner.

I est&eacute;emed aboue all other creatures, are they not gone the same way, and compelled to beare

<note place="marg">Death cannot be dispensed with.</note>
violence of his force when he commeth, for we all alike owe this life vnto him, as a due debt that
must needs be paid. But this is to be receiued with a thankefull mind, in that the bountifull beneuolence of our God hath granted that we shall be all immortall, if we our selues through vice,
&amp; as it were spotted with filthie diseases of the mind, doo not fall into the danger of eternall death.
Wherefore of right (me thinke) I haue cause to reioise, that God by his singular fauour hath
granted to me such a sonne, which in all mens iudgements was woorthie to be beloued whilest
<note place="marg">Why we ought to take the death of our children and friends patientlie.</note>
he was here amongst vs, and to be wished for now, after he is departed from hence. But
ought we to take it heauilie, that he to whome he belonged, and who had lent him vnto vs,
should call for him againe, and take him that was his owne? For what iniurie is it, if (when I
see occasion) I shall aske that againe, which you haue possessed through my benefit as lent
to you for a time? Neither doo I trust to want him long, if God shall be so mercifull vnto
me, as I wish him to be: for I hope shortlie to be called hence by commandement of that
most high king, and to be caried vp to rest among that fellowship of heauenlie spirits,
where I shall find my father and mother, my brethren, wife, and sonne in far better estate
than here I knew them. Therefore that I may repeate it once againe, I reioise (I say) to haue
obteined in my sonne, by the grace of the supernall God, that I am assured by faith, he is alreadie in that place to the which all we doo earnestlie wish that we may atteine, and doo indeuour by all means, that when the time commeth in which our soules are to be loosed foorth
of these fraile bodies of ours, as out of prisons, they may be found woorthie of that companie,
in which our confidence is that he now most blissefullie is remaining. Except anie man may
thinke that we are so enuious, that therefore we doo lament, because as yet we sticke fast
ouerwhelmed and drowned in such filthie miers, and cumbred in such thornie thickets and
bushes, out of the which he (being now deliuered of all cares) hath escaped. But let vs rather by following the footsteps of him and other vertuous persons that are gone afore vs,
labor both day and night, that at length (through heauenlie fauour) we may come to the place
where we doo reckon that by diuine power he is alreadie arriued."</p>
<p>After that the king had made an end of his oration, and thanks giuen to God for his bountifull magnificence, they rose from the table, and departed to their lodgings, they all greatlie
maruelling at the kings high prudence and godlie wisdome. Then was Malcolme, the eldest

sonne of the before mentioned prince Henrie, proclamed in his place prince of Scotland, and

conueied through the most parts of the realme by Duncane earle of Fife, and other of the
nobles appointed to attend vpon and to receiue the oths of all the barons for their allegiance
in his name. William the second sonne of prince Henrie was conueied into Northumberland
<note place="marg">Earle of Northumberland.</note>
by the foresaid nobles, and there proclamed and created earle of that countrie. Then went
king Dauid himselfe vnto Carleill, where he met with Henrie the sonne of the empresse, who
receiued the order of knighthood there at his hands. This was a little before that the same
<note place="marg">Henrie the empresse his sonne receiueth the order of knighthood.</note>
Henrie came to an agr&eacute;ement with king Stephan, whereby he was admitted to the possession
of halfe the realme of England, and promised by oth of assurance (as the Scotish writers say)
that he should neuer go about to take the countries of Northumberland, Cumberland, and
Huntington from the crowne of Scotland.</p>
<p>Shortlie after was king Dauid taken with a sore disease and maladie, which continued with
him to the end of his life. And so when he perceiued himselfe to wax faint and f&eacute;eble, he
required to be borne into the church, where he receiued the sacrament of the Lords bodie and
bloud, with most solemne reuerence: and then being brought againe to his chamber, he called
togither his nobles, and commending to them his yoong nephues, the sons of his son the

<note place="marg">King Dauid departeth out of this life.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1153.</date></note>
forenamed prince Henrie, he kissed ech one of them after another, most instantlie desiring them in
the honor of almightie God, to s&eacute;eke the preseruation of common quiet, to the aduancement
of the publike weale. This doone, he departed out of this life in the 29 yeare of his reigne,
or rather in the 30 yeare, if he reigned 29 and two moneths, as Iohn Maior saith. His bodie
was buried in Dunfirmeling, after the incarnation of Christ our Sauiour 1153 yeares.</p>
<p>How farre this prince king Dauid excelled in noble vertues and sober conuersation of life,
I haue thought it better to passe ouer with silence, than to go about in few words to comprehend that, wherein if I should spend much time, I were not able in anie wise woorthilie to performe. For where in such cases few things are slenderlie shewed, the residue may s&eacute;eme to be
omitted through fault of the writer. But yet this is not to be forgotten, that where his singular
<note place="marg">His singular pitie toward the poore.</note>

<note place="marg">King Dauids court.</note>
pitifull regard, which he had toward the reliefe of the poore, passed all other his notable vertues, he purged his court also in such wise of all vicious rule and misordered customes, that his
whole familie was giuen onelie to the exercise of vertue. No riotous banketting nor surfetting ch&eacute;ere was vsed amongst them, no lasciuious woord heard come forth of anie mans mouth,
nor yet anie wanton signes shewed to prouoke sensuall lust or carnall concupiscence. All the
woords, works, and whole demeanor of his seruants tended to some conclusion: nothing
<note place="marg">King Dauids seruants.</note>
mooued to stirre strife or sedition, but all things ordered in such friendlie and peaceable sort, that
the chaine of brotherly loue s&eacute;emed to haue linked them all in one mind and will. Such a

rule was their maister king Dauid vnto them and all other, to direct and frame a perfect and

<p>Henrie the second of that name king of England, hearing that Malcolme had thus subdued
his domesticall enimies, feared least he being imboldened therewith, should now attempt somewhat against the Englishmen; and therefore by counsell of his nobles, he sent an herald vnto
king Malcolme, commanding him to come vp to London, there to doo his homage vnto him,
<note place="marg">K. Malcolme summoned to doo homage.</note>
for the lands of Cumberland, Northumberland, and Huntington, in maner and forme as his
grandfather king Dauid had before doone vnto his predecessor Henrie the first, with certificat,
that if he failed, he would take from him all the said lands. King Malcolme obeied this commandement of king Henrie: but yet vnder condition (as the Scotish writers affirme) that it
should in no maner wise preiudice the franchises and liberties of the Scotish kingdome. At

to returne home into Scotland; who at his comming home, sent the bishop of Murrey, and
one of his secretaries vnto the s&eacute;e of Rome, as ambassadors vnto the pope, which as then hight

Malcolme to come vnto Yorke, to a parlement which he held there, where at his comming he
<note place="marg">K. Malcome goeth to Yorke.</note>
was burdened with a right grieuous complaint surmized against him by king Henrie, for that
he should reueale vnto the Frenchmen all the secrets of the English armie, when he was with
him in France, at the aboue remembred iournie, alledging the same to be sufficient matter, for
the which he ought to forfeit all the lands which h&eacute;e held of the crowne of England, as Cumberland, Northumberland, and Huntington. And though king Malcolme by manie 
<note place="marg">Fond dealing and not likelie to be true.</note>

<note place="marg">Sentence giuen against K. Malcolme at Yorke.</note>
substantiall reasons declared those allegations to be vntrue and vniustlie forged, yet by king Henries
earnest inforcing of the matter, sentence was giuen against him, by the generall consent of all the
estates there in that parlement assembled. And moreouer, to bring king Malcolme in
further displeasure with the nobles, king Henrie gaue notice vnto them, before king
Malcolme returned backe into his countrie, how he had of his owne accord renounced
all his claime, right, title, and interest, which he had to the foresaid lands, supposing by this
means to make king Malcolme farre more odious to all his lieges and subiects, than euer he
was before.</p>
<p>Malcolme therefore, vpon his returne into his countrie, not vnderstanding anie thing of
that subtill contriued policie and slanderous report, was besieged within the castell of Bertha
<note place="marg">K. Malcolme is besieged.</note>
by the thane of Ernedaie, and diuerse others. But after it was knowne how euill king

Malcolme had been vsed, and most vntrulie slandered, they desired pardon of their offense, as induced thereto by vntrue reports, which once being granted, they brake vp their siege, and euer
after continu&eacute;d in faithfull allegiance like true and most obedient subiects. But king Malcolme
sore mooued for that he was thus iniuriouslie handled by king Henrie, first desiring restitution to be made of all such things as had b&eacute;ene wrongfullie taken from him, and so deteined
by th' Englishmen, proclamed open warres against them. At length, after sundrie harmes
<note place="marg">Open warres proclamed against the Englishmen.</note>

<note place="marg">A conclusion of agr&eacute;ement.</note>
doone, as well on the one part as the other, they came to a communication in a certeine appointed place, not far from Carleill, where (to be briefe) it was finallie concluded, that K.
Malcolme should receiue againe Cumberland and Huntington: but for Northumberland, he
should make a plaine release thereof vnto king Henrie, and to his successors for euer.</p>
<p>For the which agr&eacute;ement he ran so farre into the hatred of his people, that he might neuer

after find means to win their fauor againe; but doubting least if they should stirre anie rebellion against him, they might become an easie preie vnto the Englishmen, they remained
quiet for a time. Howbeit shortlie after, there arose another p&eacute;ece of trouble, though lesse
in outward apperance, by reason of the small power remaining in the author, yet dangerous
inough, considering it was within the realme it selfe. One Angus as then the thane of 
<note place="marg">Angus the thane of Galloway raiseth a commotion: vpon what occasion writers make not anie mention.</note>
Galloway, perceiuing he might not by secret practise atchiue his purposed intent (whatsoeuer the
same was) determined by open force to assaie what luckie succes fortune would send him;
hoping that those which through feare sate as yet still, would assist him in all his attempts, so
soone as they saw anie commotion raised by him to occasion them thereto. Herevpon he assembled togither a great companie: but before he could worke anie notable feat, to make anie account of, Gilcrist earle of Angus (whose faithfull valiancie was before manifestlie approoued

&amp; chased Angus himselfe into Whiterne, where is a place of sanctuarie priuiledged for the safegard of all offendors that flie thereto for succor in the honor of saint Ninian.</p>
<p>Malcolme then, for that he durst not breake the franchises of that place, set a band of men
<note place="marg">Angus besieged in Whiterne.</note>
of warre round about it, to watch that he should by no means escape awaie; so that at length
wearied as it had bene with long siege, he y&eacute;elded himselfe to the king, who taking his sonne
<note place="marg">Angus y&eacute;eldeth himselfe to the king.</note>
to pledge for his good abearing in time to come, licenced him to go whither it should please
him: but the most part of his lands and liuings were confiscat to the kings vse. Wherevpon
when he saw he might not mainteine his estate as he had doone before, he became a canon in

Holie rood house, and there ended his life (as it is reported.) It was not long after the pacifieng of this trouble, but that a new rebelion was raised: for the Murrey land men, by the

<note place="marg">The crueltie of the rebels.</note>
prouocation of their capteine called Gildo, wasted with fire and sword the countries of Rosse,
Bowgewall, or Bougdale, Mar, Gareoch, Buchquhane, and the Mernes, in more cruell sort
than anie forreine &amp; most barbarous nation would haue doone; insomuch that when the king
sent diuers of his seruants vnto them to vnderstand the cause of their rebellious dooings, they
slue those messengers, contrarie to the law of nations.</p>
<p>To punish such iniurious attempts, the abouenamed Gilcrist was sent with an armie into 
<note place="marg">Gilcrist discomfited by the Murreis.</note>
Murrey land: but the rebels nothing discouraged with the knowledge of his approoued prowesse,
met him in the field, and put him to flight. H&eacute;erevpon the king himselfe, supposing that his
presence was n&eacute;edfull to incourage his people after this ouerthrow, came with a farre greater
power than he had sent foorth before, with displaied banner, ouer the riuer of Speie, n&eacute;ere to
the mouth whereof he fought with the enimies, and in the end (after sore and long fight continued with great slaughter and bloudshed) he gaue them the ouerthrow, and in reuenge of their
<note place="marg">The Murreies are ouerthrowen.</note>
cruelties shewed in time of this their rebellion, and to giue example to all other his subiects that
should go about to attempt the like, he commanded that none of those of Murrey land should
be saued (women, children, and aged persons onelie excepted) but that all the residue of that
generation shuld passe by the edge of the sword. Thus the Murrey land men being destroied
according to his commandement thorough all parts of the realme, he appointed other people to
inhabit their roomes, that the countrie should not lie wast without habitation.</p>
<p>In this meane time, Somerleid the thane of Argile, who (as ye haue heard) was fled ouer
<note place="marg">The Murreies destroied.</note>
into Ireland, vpon trust of the hatred into the which Malcolme was run, with the most part of

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"295"</fw>-->

all his nobles and commons, through this slaughter of his people, and namelie of them of Murrey land, he thought to assaie fortunes chance once againe, and so therevpon returned with 
<note place="marg">Somerleid returneth into Scotland.</note>

<note place="marg">Somerleid vanquished at Renfrow.</note>

<note place="marg">Somerleid is hanged.</note>
certeine Kernes and naked men into Scotland. But this last enterprise of his came to a more
vnluckie end than the first, for being vanquished in battell at Renfrow, he lost the most part
of all his men, and was taken prisoner himselfe, and after hanged on a gibbet, by commandement of the king, according to that he had iustlie merited. Malcolme hauing thus subdued
his aduersaries, and being now in rest and quiet, he set his mind wholie to gouerne his realme
in vpright iustice, and hauing two sisters mariable, he coopled the elder named Margaret
<note place="marg">King Malcolmes sisters maried.</note>
with Conon duke of Britaine, and the yoonger called Adhama he maried with Florens earle of
Holland.</p>
<p>After this, there was a councell holden at Scone of all the Scotish nobilitie, where when
<note place="marg">A parlement at Scone.</note>
they were assembled togither in the councell-chamber, Arnold archbishop of saint Andrewes
stood vp, and by a verie pithie oration, tooke vpon him to aduise the king to change his 
<note place="marg">The oration of Arnold bishop of saint Andrewes.</note>
purpose touching his vow, which (as app&eacute;ered) he had made to liue chast. He declared vnto him
by manie weightie reasons, that it was not onlie necessarie for him and his realme, that he
should take a wife (by whome he might raise vp s&eacute;ed to succ&eacute;ed him in the possession of the
crowne) but also that he might not choose a more perfect state of life (considering the office
wherein he was placed) than matrimonie, being instituted, not by this law-maker or that, but
<note place="marg">Matrimonie instituted by God.</note>

<note place="marg">The pleasure of mariage.</note>

<note place="marg">The commodities by a wife.</note>
by God himselfe, who in no one of all his ordinances might erre or be deceiued. Againe for
pleasure, he affirmed how nothing could be more delectable to him, than to haue a woorthie
ladie to his bedfellow, with whome he might conferre all the conceits of his hart, both of griefe
and gladnesse, she being a comfort vnto him as well in weale as in wo, an helpe both in sicknesse &amp; health, redie to asswage anger, and to aduance mirth, also to refresh the spirits being
wearied or in anie wise faint through studious trauell and care of mind.</p>
<p>Then shewed he what an aid children were vnto their parents, namelie to kings, how in
<note place="marg">Children an aid.</note>
peace they might gouerne vnder them, to the great commoditie of the common-wealth, and in
warre supplie their roomes as lieutenants in defense of their countries, to the no small terror
of the enimies. Wherefore sith men are not borne onelie for their owne weale, but also for
<note place="marg">Men not borne for themselues.</note>
the profit of their friends, and commoditie of their countrie; it could not be chosen, but that
he ought to persuade with himselfe to alter his purposed intention, concerning the obseruance
of chastitie, and to take a wife to the great ioy and comfort of his subiects, sith it was 
<note place="marg">Commendable before God and man.</note>
commendable both before God and man, and so necessarie withall and profitable, as nothing might be
more. But these and manie other most weightie reasons could nothing mooue his constant
<note place="marg">K. Malcolme might not be persuaded to take a wife.</note>
mind, hauing euen from his tender y&eacute;eres afflanced his virginitie vnto Christ, trusting that
God would so prouide, that the realme should not be destitute of conuenient heires, when the
time came that it should please his diuine maiestie to take him hence to his mercie from
amongst his subiects. Thus brake vp that councell without anie effect of the purpose for the
which it was called.</p>
<p>Shortlie after it chanced that king Malcolme fell sicke, continuing so a long time, by reason
whereof he sought meanes to conclude a peace with Henrie king of England; which being
<note place="marg">A peace concluded with England.</note>

<note place="marg">The Abbeie of saint Andrewes builded.</note>
brought to passe, he set woorkemen in hand to laie the foundation of saint Rewles abbeie,
which afterwards bare the name of saint Andrewes. When he had finished this house, being
a goodlie p&eacute;ece of woorke, and verie costlie, as may app&eacute;ere at this day by the view thereof, he
assigned foorth certeine rents for the sustentation of the canons, whome he placed there of the
order of saint Augustine, not so largelie as serued for the maintenance of superfluous cheere,
<note place="marg">Superfluous rents of abbeies, prouocations to inordinate lusts.</note>
but yet sufficient for their necessarie finding: by reason whereof, the canons of that abbeie
liued in those daies in most feruent deuotion, hauing no prouocations at all to inordinate lusts
and sensuall pleasures; but onelie giuen to diuine contemplation, without respect to auarice,
or inlarging the possessions and reuenues of their house. He founded also the abbeie of

Lion. Shortlie after his coronation, he sent ambassadors vnto Henrie king of England, requiring him, that according to iustice, he would restore vnto him the earledome of Northumberland, sith it apperteined by good and lawfull interest vnto his inheritance. King
Henrie answered the messengers, that if king William would come vnto London, and there doo
his homage for Cumberland and Huntington, he should be assured to haue all things so ordered,
as he reasonablie could wish or demand. H&eacute;erevpon king William went into England, and
so came to London, and after he had doone his homage for Cumberland and Huntington,
he required the restitution of Northumberland. But king Henrie made answer as then,
that forsomuch as the same was annexed to the crowne, he might not without the assent of
all the estates of his realme make restitution thereof. Notwithstanding, in the next parlement, he promised to cause the matter to be proponed: and if it came to passe that his demand were found to stand with reason, he would doo therein according to conscience, when
time expedient should serue thereto.</p>
<p>About the same season, king Henrie passed ouer into Normandie with an armie, and
<note place="marg">King Henrie saileth into Normandie.</note>

<note place="marg">King William with manie nobles of Scotland went with king Henrie ouer into France.</note>
caused king William, with manie other nobles of Scotland, to go with him in that iournie.
For K. William would not disobeie his commandement at that present, in hope to atteine in
quiet and peaceable manner his sute touching the restitution of Northumberland (as the
Scotish writers doo affirme) but in the end, after he had continued a long time with king
Henrie, and perceiued no comfort to recouer his lands, he got licence with much adoo to
returne home: and so comming backe into England, passed through the realme with his
nobles into Scotland, where he applied his whole indeuour to vnderstand the state of the
common-wealth of his subiects, and speciallie he tooke order in most diligent wise, to punish
cruelties doone by theeues and robbers, which vndoubtedlie was one of the most profitable
<note place="marg">K. Williams zeale of iustice.</note>
acts that he could deuise to accomplish at that present, considering the state of his realme,
as it then stood. For if the damages &amp; skathes committed by th&eacute;eues and robbers were
<note place="marg">Scotland more indamaged by domesticall th&eacute;eues than by foraine enimies.</note>
equallie pondered with the hurts and hinderances which dailie grow by open warre against
anie forren nation, it may well app&eacute;ere, that more harme ariseth, &amp; more heinous cruelties
are exercised against the poore and miserable commons and innocent people, by such as
liue by rapine &amp; spoiling at home, than by anie outward enimies, be they neuer so fierce and
strong in the field. And therefore the prudent consideration of this prince was no lesse
to be commended, in that he sought to represse the licentious outrage of such arrand
th&eacute;eues and priuie murtherers, than if he had slaine manie thousands of forren enimies.</p>
<p>When he had once clensed the realme of those misgouerned persons, he sent eftsoones
<note place="marg">Ambassadors sent to king Henrie.</note>
his ambassadors to king Henrie, requiring (as before) to haue Northumberland restored vnto
him, with notice giuen, that if he might not haue it with fauour, he would assaie to recouer

<note place="marg">S&eacute;e more thereof in England.</note>
either else haue open warres with the Scots, by aduise of his nobles, restored to king
William so much of Northumberland as his grandfather K. Malcolme had in possession.

full recompense of the whole which was due vnto him (so sale the Scotish writers) but so
as his entier right might alwaies be saued as well to the residue as to that which was then
restored. Within few y&eacute;eres after, king Henrie f&eacute;eling what hinderance it was for him to
forbeare the commodities of those lands, which were thus deliuered vp to the Scotish kings

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"297"</fw>-->

vse, repented him of that bargaine: and therefore to find some occasion to recouer the same
again, he procured his subiects that dwelled vpon the borders, to make forreies into the
lands perteining to the Scots, so to prouoke them to battell.</p>
<p>Complaint of these iniuries being brought vnto the warden of the Scotish borders, by
such Scots as had lost such goods as were taken awaie by the Englishmen, he sent to demand restitution; but forsomuch as he could haue no towardlie answer, he got togither
a great number of men, the which entering into the English ground, did much hurt on
ech side where they came. At the same time was king Henrie in France, and therefore
the Englishmen thought it sufficient to defend themselues as well as they might without
attempting anie notable enterprise in reuenge of the displeasures doone by the Scots. Haruest was also at hand, and therevpon they ceassed on either part from further inuasions,
till the winter season, which passed also without anie exploit atchiued, woorthie to be remembred; sauing certeine small rodes made by the Scots into the English borders, as they
saw occasion to serue thereto.</p>
<p>But in the summer next following, king William raised a mightie armie, and came with
<note place="marg">King William inuadeth Cumberland.</note>
the same into Cumberland, the right wing of the which armie was led by Gilcrist, whose
approoued valiancie often shewed in the time of king Malcolme, had aduanced him to
marie with the kings sister. The left wing was assigned vnto the conduct of one Rowland
the kings coosen, who was also lieutenant of the horssemen. The middle ward or battell
the king himselfe led. The Englishmen, to the intent they might haue time and leasure
to assemble their power, sent vnto king William, offering vnto him, not onelie large summes
<note place="marg">The offers of the Englishmen.</note>
of monie, if he would returne backe with his armie without further inuasion, but also redresse of all maner of iniuries and wrongs, if anie such on their behalfe were to be prooued.
But king William for answer h&eacute;erevnto declared, that he had not begun the warre for anie
<note place="marg">The answer of king William.</note>
desire he had to monie; neither had he first giuen the occasion, as one that was euer willing to liue vpon his owne: so that if they could be contented to restore Northumberland
being his rightfull heritage, he was not so desirous of bloud, but that he would gladlie
ceasse from all further attempts.</p>
<p>The Englishmen hauing receiued this answer, to the end they might protract the time in
sending still to and fro, till they might espie some occasion to woorke such feates as they
had imagined, addressed foorth other ambassadors vnto king William, with diuerse faire
offers and golden promises. In the meane time, to take the Scotishmen at some aduantage,
they conueie their whole power in the night season neere vnto the place where the same
<note place="marg">The Englishmen s&eacute;eke by policie to vanquish the Scots.</note>
Scotishmen laie in campe, &amp; diuiding themselues into two parts, the one was appointed to
abide in the fields, till the sunne were vp, and then to shew themselues to the enimies, to
traine them foorth to battell: the other companie was laid closelie in a vallie not farre off,
to take the aduantage as they saw their time. In the morning about the rising of the sunne,
those that were appointed to procure the skirmish, approched so n&eacute;ere to the enimies campe,
till they came euen within sight of them. The Scots amazed with the strangnesse of the
thing, for that they had not heard before of anie assemblie of the Englishmen, at the first
were somewhat afraid: but anon incouraging one another, they boldlie issued forth vpon
their enimies, who of purpose (at the first) made but weake resistance, and at length fled
<note place="marg">The Englishmen retire of purpose.</note>

<note place="marg">The king left but weakelie garded.</note>
amaine, to the intent to cause the Scotishmen to breake their arraie of battell in pursuing
them, which they did so egerlie, that they left their king but slenderlie garded with a small
companie about him. Then the ambushment lieng in the vallie, brake foorth vpon him,
according to the order before appointed, and in the meane time, the other that fled cast
themselues about, and manlie abode their enimies, so earnestlie laieng it to their charge, that

for the one part in the beginning of the fraie (as ye haue heard) fleeing of set purpose to the
place where their ambush laie, escaped without much hurt; and the other, scared by the breaking foorth of the ambush, abode the brunt but a small while, returning immediatlie towards
the king; and then perceiuing they could doo no good, they made the best shift they could ech
man for himselfe, to escape the enimies hands. The king being thus taken of his enimies,
<note place="marg">King William conueied into Normandie.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1174.</date></note>
was conueied to king Henrie ouer into Normandie, where he was as then remaining. The
y&eacute;ere that king William was thus taken, was after the birth of our Sauiour Christ 1174, and
the ninth ofking Williams reigne.</p>
<p>&para; Other writers report the maner of his taking, not altogither agr&eacute;eable with that which
<note place="marg">Discord of writers.</note>
we haue h&eacute;ere aboue remembred, who declare how K. William, after he had wasted all Cumberland, came into Northumberland, not ceassing till he came to Anwike, where he staied
for a time to haue had battell: but in the meane while the Englishmen laie close togither without noise or appearance, in such wise that no Scotishman could haue vnderstanding where they
were. At length king William wearied with long tarieng thus at Anwike, and seeing no enimies to app&eacute;ere, determined to woorke some exploit yet before his returne, and therevpon sent
foorth the most part of all his armie abroad into the countrie, to forreie the same, k&eacute;eping no
great companie about him, till the returne of the other thus sent foorth. Wherevpon incontinentlie a great ambushment of Englishmen came vpon him with counterfeited Scotish ensignes, and were not once suspected for Englishmen, till the king was compassed in by them
on ech side, and so finallie taken and led awaie yer anie Scotishman wist thereof, saue a few
<note place="marg"><emph>Wilhelmus Paruus.</emph></note>
which were left (as is said) with him for the time. In d&eacute;ed Wilhelmus Paruus, a canon sometime in the abbeie of Bridlington in Yorkeshire, in that his booke which he writes of the
Norman kings of England, affirmes how there were not manie more than about three score
horesemen with king William, while he was thus taken; and that the Englishmen were not past
foure hundred horssemen, which tooke vpon them that enterprise; whose capteins (as hereteth)
<note place="marg">Capteins of the Englishmen.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>W. Paruus.</emph></note>
were these: Robert de Stuteuill, Ranulfe de Glanuill, Bernard de Ballioll, and diuerse other.</p>
<p>The same author writeth, that after the taking of the king, there rose a mutinie amongst
the Scots: for whereas the Irish Scots bare a naturall grudge against the English Scots, yet
whilest the king was present amongst them, they durst not vtter their malicious intentions: but
now that he was thus taken from them, so manie of the English Scots as fell into the hands of the
Irish, paid d&eacute;erelie for the bargaine, being cruellie murthered and slaine: so that the residue
were constreined to get them out of the waie into castels and towers. where they might be receiued. But now it is to be considered, that bicause there was no great slaughter made at the
taking of king William, the warres notwithstanding continued betwixt England and Scotland:
for the two before specified chiefteins Gilcrist and Rowland stoutlie withstood the 
<note place="marg">Gilcrist and Rowland resist the Englishmen.</note>
Englishmen, and beat them backe as they enterprised to enter into Cumberland. At length a peace
was taken, during the time that king William remained in captiuitie; vnder these conditions,
that Northumberland should continue vnder the dominion of the Englishmen, and 
<note place="marg">Northumberland vnder the Englishmen.</note>
Cumberland (with the earledome of Huntington) to remaine (as before) vnder the gouernance of the
Scotishmen.</p>

Huntington, thorough licence of king Henrie came into Scotland, to haue the gouernement of
the realme, till the king his brother might be redeemed. So soone therefore as he had once
established the realme in good quiet and iustice, he sent Richard the bishop of saint Andrewes,
with diuerse other noble men, ouer into Normandie, to take order there with K. Henrie for the
rausome of the king his brother, which was agr&eacute;ed in this manner. First, it was

Roxburgh &amp; Striueling, were deliuered into the Englishmens hands. These things being
thus ordereo the eight day of December 1175, &amp; the king restored home, there followed a
new stirre in Scotland, for Gilbert of Galloway, a right cruell and most mischiefous person,
purposing to conquer the crowne by force, made great slaughter of all them that withstood his
desire. And because his brother reprooued his dooings, he put out his eies, and cut off his
hands. Against this Gilbert was Gilcrist sent with an armie by the king. There was fought
a sore battell betwixt them, for the most part of those that followed Gilberts commandement,
were desperat fellowes, such commonlie as for murder and other heinous crimes by them committed were in danger of the lawes, and therefore vpon hope of pardon desired a change; but
yet in the end, Gilcrist with multitude wan the field of them, and slue more in the chase than

<note place="marg"><emph>Wilhelmus Paruus.</emph></note>
in the battell. Gilbert himselfe escaped and got ouer into the Ile of Man, and fled from thence
into Ireland. Wilhelmus Paruus reporteth this matter somewhat otherwise, as thus: In the
armie of king William (saith he) when he was taken neere vnto Anwike, were two brethren,
Gilbert and Vared, that were lords of Galloway, hauing there with them a great retinue of
their countriemen. These were the sonnes of Fergusius, sometime lord of that prouince; after whose deceasse the king of Scots that is superiour lord thereof, diuided the countrie betwixt these two brethren. But Gilbert the eldest brother found himselfe much grieued to
haue anie part of those lands (which were his fathers) giuen from him; yet doubting punishment at the kings hands, he durst not attempt anie thing against his brother, till it fortuned
the king to be taken. And then deliuered of the feare which had staied his mischiefous purpose, he taketh his brother at vnwares, and cruellie murdered him, after no common maner;
but rather martyred him in beastlie wise, so to satisfie the instinct of his diuelish nature. And
immediatlie after inuading the vpper countries, he exerciseth great slaughter of men on each
hand. But his brother had a sonne called Rowland, which proouing a valiant yoong gentleman, boldlie resisted his vncles rage, with the assistance and aid of his fathers friends. And
thus was Scotland brought into trouble (as Wilhelmus Paruus recordeth) till by the foresaid
Gilcrist the murderer was expelled, as before is expressed. In the yeare following came Hugo
<note place="marg">Hugh cardinall of saint Angelo the popes legat.</note>
cardinall of saint Angelo as legat from the pope into England, with authoritie to reforme the
English churches, in such cases as were thought requisit; and after he had made an end there,
to doo the like in Scotland. When he had therefore finished with England, he cited all the 
<note place="marg">The bishops of Scotland summoned to a conuocation at Northampton.</note>
bishops of Scotland to appeare before him at a day prefixed at Northampton. They came according to his appointment, and being assembled there in consistorie, he went about in most
earnest wise to persuade them to receiue the archbishop of Yorke for their metropolitane. But
one Gilbert a yoong man, howbeit singularlie well learned, and for his holinesse of life much
<note place="marg">Gilbert a learned man defended the liberties of Scotland.</note>
commended (as Hector Boetius writeth) being sent of purpose by king William vnto this conuocation, to foresee that nothing were conclud&eacute;d in the same, preiudiciall to the ancient liberties and franchises of the realme of Scotland, did argue so stifflie to the contrarie, that the cardinall left off the pursute of such maner of matter, and brake vp that councell without determination of anie thing to the purpose in that behalfe.</p>
<p>This Gilbert that thus defended the cause and liberties of the Scotish clergie, was afterwards

his supposed perfect holinesse of life among the number of saints. The chiefest cause that
mooued the Scotish cleargie to withdraw their obedience from the primasie of Yorke, was the
dissention and continuall enimitie betwixt the two nations for superioritie in temporall causes.
The same yeare that this councell was holden at Northampton, sundrie vnketh woonder
<note place="marg">Woonders.</note>
were s&eacute;ene in Albion. On Midsummer day being the feast day of the natiuitie of saint Iohn
the Baptist, there fell such a storme of haile, that it killed manie sh&eacute;epe and small cattell: 
<note place="marg">Haile.</note>
people that were out of houses, and from vnder couert anie where abroad, were beaten to the eartl
with violence of that storme. The sunne in September about noonetide was darkened for the

space of two houres togither, without anie eclipse or cause naturall by interposition of clouds.
In Yorkeshire was such terrible thunder with strange lightening, that manie abbeies and

in honor of Thomas Becket archbishop of Canturburie, with whome (as is said) he had great
familiaritie in time of his yoong yeares. At the same time the abbeie of Hadington was founded by Adhama the mother of king William, and shortlie after she had built it, she died. Not
long after, king William sent as ambassadors Iohn bishop of saint Andrews, and Reignald abbat
of Arbroth vnto pope Alexander the third, to present vnto him his obeisance, according
as he thought stood with his duetie. The pope s&eacute;eming to reioise thereat, sent shortlie
after vnto the king a rose of gold, filled with balme, and certeine new priuileges concerning

death if he might haue got him into his hands: but when he saw he could not be found, he
proclamed him traitor, and raced his castell (wherein he had dwelled) quite to the ground, in
such wise that vnneth remaineth anie token at this day where it stood. This Gilcrist had a
brother that hight Bredus, who before this mischance had got the lands of Ogiluie: of whome
the house of the Ogiluies tooke their beginning, that after came to great authoritie in the
court, though at this time (through Gilcrists offense) his whole familie was n&eacute;ere hand destroied. About this time also, the queene, king William his wife, deceassed. A daughter which
he had by hir, named Adhama, he gaue in mariage vnto the earle of Laon: but he himselfe

after the deceasse of this his first wife maried Emengard, daughter to Richard vicount of Beaumount that was sonne to a daughter of king William the Conquerour. By this mariage and
aliance, the peace was newlie confirmed betwixt England and Scotland, in such wise, that neither part might receiue anie rebels to the other, by means whereof Gilcrist, that before was
fled into England, was constreined to returne into Scotland, disguised in poore w&eacute;ed, with two
of his sonnes, and there passed foorth his life a long time in great miserie amongest the woods
and in out places, vnknowen to anie man what he was, by reason of his poore and simple habit. Somewhat before the aboue remembred mariage, Henrie king of England at the

sonne, whome latelie before he had caused to be crowned king, that went about to vsurpe the
sole administration to himselfe now in his fathers life time. About the same time William
went with an armie into Rosse, against Makulzen and Makbein, two capteins of the westerne
Iles, which vsed vpon occasion to passe ouer into Rosse, Cathnes and Murrey land, spoiling
and wasting those countries; &amp; when they heard of anie power comming against them, they

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"would"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"301"</fw>-->

would streight returne to their ships, and repasse againe into the Iles. But at this time, the
king had sent foorth a nauie to burne all those vessels, wherein the robbers had passed ouer
and had left at anchor, by reason whereof when they were inclosed in on euerie side by the
king, and taken prisoners, they after had suffered death on the wh&eacute;ele, according to the maner
<note place="marg">Death on the wh&eacute;ele.</note>
of the ciuill law.</p>
<p>The king in his returne from this iournie, came by the abbeie of Abirbrothoke, to view
<note place="marg">Abirbrothoke is builded.</note>
the woorke of that house, how it went forwards, commanding them that were ouers&eacute;ers and
maisters of the works to spare for no costs, but to bring it vp to perfection, and that with most
magnificence. After his departure from thence, he tooke the way toward Bertha, and by aduenture espied where Gilcrist was deluing vp turfes, togither with his two sonnes. And though
<note place="marg">Gilcrist deluing clods.</note>
he knew not what they were, yet he mused to s&eacute;e two such goodlie yoong men, as by resemblance they appeared to be, to be thus occupied in such toiling and base labour. Incontinentlie herewith Gilcrist with his bald head came afore him, and falling downe on his knees
<note place="marg">Gilcrist asketh pardon of the king in vnknowne habit.</note>
at the kings f&eacute;et said: "If there be anie mercie in th&eacute;e (most ruthfull prince) for them that
are brought through their offenses into extreme miserie, hauing suffered condigne punishment
for the same; I bes&eacute;ech th&eacute;e for the loue that Christ had to all sinfull people, not sparing to
shed his most pretious bloud for their redemption, to haue some pitie &amp; compassion on me,
&amp; these my poore &amp; miserable sons, which with me haue suffered much griefe and penurie, not
hauing deserued the same by anie crime by them committed."</p>
<p>At the last, when king William had inquired of him what he was, and how it chanced he
<note place="marg">Gilcrist declareth what he is.</note>
fell into such kind of miserie, the teares came so fast trickeling from his eies, that of a long time
he was not able to declare his owne name. At length being come to himselfe, he said: "I am
Gilcrist (noble prince) the most sorrowfull creature on earth, which (alas) put my hands in
thy bloud, and was therefore disherited of all my lands, and banished with these my two sonnes
out of thy realme, wherevpon we remained in England for a time, till through proclamation
made against outlawes, I was constreined to come hither againe with my said sonnes, where
we haue liued by roots all the summer season, and now in the winter are glad to get our liuing
with trauell of hand thus in digging and deluing of clods. Therfore if anie ruth or pitie
haue place in thy heart, or that thine indignation be qualified, haue mercie on our sorrowfull
estate, and remit the offense, wherby thou maiest not onelie purchase great honor and fame
by example of pitie, being highlie renowmed for that vertue amongest all nations, but also win
great merit afore God, for shewing thy selfe the follower of Christ, the giuer of all mercie,
grace, and peace."</p>
<p>The king mooued by these woords, and remembring the good seruice which Gilcrist had 
<note place="marg">The king taketh Gilcrist to his fauour, and restoreth vnto him his lands.</note>
imploid so oftentimes afore in defense of the realme; and againe pitieng his case, to consider
from what degr&eacute;e of honor he was fallen into the d&eacute;epest bottome of extreme miserie, he tooke
him wholie to his fauour, and not onelie forgaue him his former offenses, but also restored
vnto him, and to his sonnes, all such lands as sometimes apperteined vnto them, except so
much as the king had alreadie giuen vnto the abbeie of Abirbrothoke. Gilcrist euer after perseuered in due obedience to his prince. And forsomuch as his eldest sonne deceassed before
him without heires, &amp; that his yoonger sonne, by reason of some impediment which he had,
was vnm&eacute;et for mariage, he gaue the most part of his lands after his owne deceasse vnto the
<note place="marg">Gilcrists gift vnto the house of Abirbrothoke.</note>
said house of Abirbrothoke. His yoonger sonne also, no lesse well affectionated towards the
same house, gaue the residue of his lands therevnto. The father and both his sonnes are buried before the altar of S. Katharine within the church of this abbeie, as the superscription of
their toomes sheweth.</p>
<p>Though king William was earnestlie occupied in the aduancing forward of the building of
Abirbrothoke, yet did he not forget his dutie in the administration of his lawes; but diligentlie caused iustice to be executed, to the punishing of the wicked, and the rewarding of them
that well deserued. He made also sundrie new laws for the restreining of th&eacute;eues and 
<note place="marg">Laws deuised by king William against th&eacute;eues.</note>
oppressors of the people, so rigorous, that they might be in feare to heare him named. Furthermore, where as the church of Scotland was subiect to the church of Yorke, he obteined

of pope Clement the third of that name, letters of exemption for his clergie, whereby the
church of Scotland (within the which were conteined the bishops s&eacute;es of saint Andrews,
Glasco, Dunkeld, Dublaine, Brighne, Aberden, Murrey, Rosse, and Cathnesse) was de
clared exempt from all other forrein iurisdictions, except onelie from that of the see of Rome,
so as it might not be lawfull from thenceforth for any that was not of the realme of Scotland,
to pronounce sentence of interdiction or excommunication, or otherwise to deale in iudgement
of ecclesiasticall causes, except such one as the apostolike s&eacute;e of Rome should speciallie appoint, and send thither with legantine power. The date of the said bull or letters of exemption thus obteined was at the popes paace of Laterane, the third Ides of March, and first y&eacute;ere
of the said pope Clements gouernment. Shortlie after, to wit in the y&eacute;ere 1198, died Henrie
<note place="marg">The death of Henrie king of England.</note>
king of England, after whom succ&eacute;eded his second sonne Richard: for Henrie his eldest

<p>King Richard, after his coronation, prepared him selfe to passe with an armie into the holie
<note place="marg">K. Richard.</note>
land, and therefore made peace with all his neighbors, that no trouble should follow to his
realme by reason of his absence: and herevpon to keepe the Scots in friendship, rather by
beneuolence than by feare, he rendred into their hands the castels of Roxburgh, Berwike, and
<note place="marg">The castels of Roxburgh, Berwike, and Sterling rendred to king William.</note>
Sterling: and moreouer that part of Northumberland which his father had taken from king

Cumberland; but vnder condition, that all the castels and holds within them, should be in
the k&eacute;eping of his capteins and souldiors, such as he should appoint. He released to king
William also the residue of such summes of monie as were due for the foure castels laid to
gage, ten thousand pounds onelie excepted, which he receiued in hand at that present towards
the charges of his iournie. When king William had thus receiued his lands and castels by
surrender, he made his brother Dauid earle of Huntington, who therevpon dooing his homage

<note place="marg">Oliuer a Scotishman.</note>
chanced that one Oliuer a Scotishman borne, was within the towne reteined in seruice among
the Saracens; for being conuict of felonie in his natiue countrie he was banished out of the
same, and fled to the Saracens, remaning so long amongst them, that he had learned their
toong verie perfectlie, so that as then few knew what countriman he was. It fortuned that
this Oliuer had one of the gates in k&eacute;eping, on that side the towne where was but a single
wall, without trenches, or anie other fortification. He happened by some good aduenture to
espie amongst the watch of those that were of the retinue of Dauid earle of Huntington, one of
his owne kinsmen named Iohn Durward, with whom of long time before he had b&eacute;ene most
<note place="marg">Iohn Dur ward</note>
familiarlie acquainted; and incontinentlie he called to the same Durward, desiring vnder assurance to talke with him. After certeine communication, for that this Oliuer had not as yet
vtterlie in his heart renounced the christian faith, he appointed with Durward to giue entrie at
a certeine houre vnto earle Dauid, and to all the christian armie, vpon condition that earle
Dauid would s&eacute;e him restored againe vnto his land and heritage in Scotland. The houre set,
<note place="marg">Earle Dauid entered the citie Acon.</note>
earle Dauid came with a great power of men to the gate before rehersed, where he was suffered to enter according to appointment, and incontinentlie with great noise and clamour brake
into the midst of the citie.</p>
<p>In the morning betimes, king Richard perceiuing the citie thus woone, entred the same, and
shortlie after wan a tower, which the Saracens for a while manfullie defended. Thus was the
citie of Acres woone from the Saracens, chieflie by means of the Scotishmen. But now touching their returne from this voiage (for sith in other places more large mention is made of such exploits as were atchiued therein, I passe ouer to make anie longer discourse thereof in this place)
ye shall vnderstand, that in that streinable tempest, in the which king Richards nauie was dispersed in his comming homewards (as in the historie of England is more at large expressed)
the ship also that earle Dauid was in, chanced to be throwne on land on the coasts of Aegypt,

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"where"</fw>-->

where being taken prisoner, and led into Alexandria, at length he was red&eacute;emed by certeine
<note place="marg">Earle Dauid taken prisoner.</note>

<note place="marg">He is red&eacute;emed.</note>
merchants of Venice, and first conueied vnto Constantinople, and after vnto Venice, where
he was bought out &amp; red&eacute;emed by the English merchants, and in the end suffered to depart
home. At his comming into Flanders, h&eacute;e hired a vessell at Sluis, therwith to returne into
<note place="marg">He went to Scotland.</note>
Scotland; but being loosed a little off from the shore, such a vehement tempest suddenlie
arose, that droue him, not without great danger of life, n&eacute;ere to the coasts of Norwaie and
Shetland.</p>
<p>Here in the midst of this extreame ieopardie (as hath b&eacute;ene reported) after he had made a
<note place="marg">Arriued at Dund&eacute;e.</note>
vow to build a church in the honor of the virgin Marie, if he might escape that danger of seas,
he arriued at length in Taie water beside Dund&eacute;e, not far from saint Nicholas chappell, without either rudder or tackle. The place where he arriued before that time hight Alectum, but
he as then changed the name, and called it Dund&eacute;e, which signifieth as though ye should
<note place="marg">The name of Dund&eacute;e.</note>
say, The gift of God. When his brother the king heard that he was returned, supposing
long time before, that he had b&eacute;ene dead, he came sp&eacute;edilie vnto Dund&eacute;e to welcome him
home, shewing himselfe most glad of his returne, insomuch that he caused publike processions
<note place="marg">Procession was holden.</note>
to be celebrate through the realme, to giue God thanks that had thus restored his brother
home into his countrie. Earle Dauid, according as he had vowed, builded a church in the
<note place="marg">A church built.</note>
field commonlie called the wheat field, and dedicating it in honor of the virgin Marie, made
it a parish church. At a parlement also holden after this at Dund&eacute;e, licence was granted vnto
him to build an abbie in what place it shuld please him within Scotland, and to indow it with
<note place="marg">Priuileges granted to the towne of Dund&eacute;e.</note>
lands and rents as h&eacute;e should thinke good. There were also manie priuileges granted the
same time vnto Dund&eacute;e, which indure to this day.</p>
<p>Earle Dauid not refusing the grant and beneuolence of the king his brother, builded an
abbeie called Lundoris, for moonks of the order of saint Benet. One thing there is much to
<note place="marg">The abbeie of Lundoris.</note>
be woondered at, as a strange singularitie. For whereas that house standeth in a vallie, inclosed on each side with wood and water, by reason whereof there is great abundance of 
<note place="marg">Adders without hurt.</note>
adders; yet dooth no man catch hurt by anie of them, insomuch that ye shall see yong children
play and run vp and downe amongst a great number of them, without anie skath or hurt following vnto them thereof. In this meane while, Richard king of England (who also in his
returne out of the holie land was taken prisoner by the emperour of Almaine) was deliuered
for a great summe of monie, and so returned into his countrie. King William hearing of

Dauid with him, and came vnto London, where, in token of ioy, that he had vnfeinedlie conceiued for his safe comming home, after all troubles and dangers which he had passed, he
gaue vnto him two thousand markes sterling, for that he knew at what great charges he had

b&eacute;ene, aswell for furnishing of his voiage, as also for red&eacute;eming of his libertie.</p>
<p>By these friendlie points of humanitie shewed, there followed great amitie and loue betwixt
these two kings. But king William fell sicke in England, and as it often happeneth, such as
were vnquiet persons, desirous to be deliuered of all feare of lawes, were streightway put in an
vntrue beliefe, that he was dead; and causing it to be bruted abrode, began to exercise all

kind of misdemeanors by inuading the poore and simple people, with spoilings and slaughters in all parts. But after it was certeinlie knowne, that the king was not onelie aliue,
but also recouered of his infirmitie, and comming homewards, those raskals and wicked
rebels withdrew vnder the conduct of one Herald the thane of Cathnes, and erle of
Orkenie, vnto the vttermost bounds of Scotland. Howbeit the king pursued them in
such diligent and earnest maner, that he apprehended the most part of them in Cathnes, and
commanded iustice to be doone on them, in such wise, that mercie was not yet wanting:

his place. About thr&eacute;e y&eacute;eres after this, was the foresaid Alexander the kings sonne created
prince of Scotland. And the same y&eacute;ere came a legat from the pope sent to K. William, 
<note place="marg">A legat sent from the pope.</note>
presenting vnto him a sword, with a sheath &amp; hilts of gold set full of rich pretious stones. He
presented vnto him also a hat or bonet, made in maner of a diademe of purple hue, in token
<note place="marg">A hat.</note>
(as it should meane) that he was defender of the church. Manie indulgences and priuileges
<note place="marg">Defender of the church.</note>
were granted at the same time by the pope, for the libertie of the church of Scotland. It was
ordeined also the same time, that saturdaie should be kept as holidaie from noone forward, and
<note place="marg">Saturday after noone to be kept holie.</note>
great punishment appointed for them that transgressed this ordinance, in dooing anie bodilie
worke from saturdaie at noone, vntill mondaie in the morning.</p>
<p>After this, king William returned againe into England to doo his homage vnto king Iohn,
<note place="marg">King William did homage to king Iohn of England.</note>
for the lands of Cumberland, Huntington, and Northumberland. Immediatlie wherevpon
king Iohn willed him to passe with him into France, to make warres against the Frenchmen.
And bicause he refused so to doo, king Iohn made claime to all the foresaid lands as forfeited
to the crowne of England, and caused a great bootie of goods to be fetched out of the same:
so that open warres had immediatlie followed, if the English lords had not compelled K. Iohn
to make restitution of all the goods so taken; bicause they thought it not expedient in anie
wise to haue wars with the Scots at the same time, being alreadie in trouble with the Frenchmen. In the winter following, the frost was so vehement, &amp; continued so long, that till mid
March, no plough might be put into the ground. Ale was frozen in such wise within houses,
<note place="marg">Ale sold by weight.</note>
and cellers, that it was sold by weight. Such a great snow fell also therewith, that beasts died
in manie places in great numbers. Moreouer, from the Twelfthtide till Februarie, there was
euerie day verie terrible earthquakes.</p>
<note place="marg">Earthquakes.</note>
<p>After the end of winter, king Iohn hauing made an end of his warres with France, began to
build a castell in Northumberland ouer against Berwike, vpon purpose to haue some quarell to
fall out with the Scots. King William being aduertised thereof, sent his ambassadors vnto king
Iohn, requiring him to desist from such attempts, and not to s&eacute;eke anie occasion of new trouble:
but forsomuch as he receiued no towardlie answer againe from K. Iohn, he assembled a power,
&amp; comming to the castell which king Iohn had caused to be builded, he ouerthrew the same,
<note place="marg">A castell ouerthrowne.</note>
and raced it to the earth. King Iohn sore offended herewith, raised a mightie armie, and came
towards Scotland, but at his comming to the borders, he found his aduersarie king William
readie to receiue him by battell, if he had come forward; howbeit through mediation of 
<note place="marg">A peace established at York betwixt the kings Iohn and William.</note>

<note place="marg">The couen&amacr;ts of the peace.</note>
prudent men, the matter was taken vp betwixt them, so that on either side the armies were dissolued, &amp; both the kings repairing to Yorke, established a peace there, with these conditions,
that Margaret and Isabell daughters to king William, after the tearme of 9 y&eacute;eres then next insuing were once expired, should be coupled in mariage with Henrie and Richard the sons of
king Iohn, vpon this paction and couenant, that if the one died, the other should succ&eacute;ed to
the crowne. For the which it was couenanted, that king William should giue a right large
dower. Also the castell which king Iohn had builded, and king William raced, it was agr&eacute;ed
that it should remaine so defaced, and neuer after againe to be repared. For the sure performance of these articles thus betwixt the two kings concluded, nine noble men of Scotland were
<note place="marg">Scotish hostages deliuered to king Iohn.</note>
appointed to be deliuered as hostages vnto king Iohn. In that assemblie there at Yorke, king
William also surrendered into the hands of king Iohn, the lands of Cumberland, Huntington,
and Northumberland; to the intent he should assigne those lands againe vnto his sonne prince
<note place="marg">A surrender made to a vse.</note>
Alexander, and he to doo homage for the same, according to the maner and custome in that

England, as superior lords of the same. During the abode of these two kings at Yorke,
there was brought vnto them a child of singular beautie, sonne and heire to a gentleman of
great possessions in those parties, being sore vexed with diuerse and sundrie diseases; for one
of his eies was consumed &amp; lost through an issue which it had of corrupt and filthie humors,
the one of his hands was dried vp; the one of his f&eacute;et was so taken, that he had no vse thereof; and his toong likewise that he could not speake. The physicians that saw him thus troubled with such contrarie infirmities, iudged him incurable. Neuerthelesse, king William
making a crosse on him, restored him immediatlie to health. By reason whereof, manie
<note place="marg">A child healed by K. William.</note>
beleeued that this was doone by miracle, through the power of almightie God, that the vertue
of so godlie a prince might b&eacute;e notified to the world.</p>

Melros, Holie rood house, Dunfirmling, and Aberden, with manie faire possessions, as the
letters patents made therof by him beare manifest testimonie. He also erected one new
bishops see called Argile, giuing therto sufficient lands towards the maintenance and sustentation thereof. After this, comming vnto the towne of Bertha, he had not remained there
manie daies, but there chanced such a floud, by reason of the rising and inundation of the
two riuers, Taie &amp; Almond, that through violence of the streme the towne wals were borne
downe, and much people in the towne drowned, yer they could make anie shift to saue themselues, insomuch that though the king with his wife, and the most part of his familie
<note place="marg">The king in danger of drowning.</note>

<note place="marg">Iohn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings son drowned.</note>
escaped out of that great danger and ieopardie, his yoongest sonne yet named Iohn, with
his nursse and twelue other women perished, and twentie other of his seruants beside.
H&eacute;ere was heard such clamor, noise, &amp; lamentable cries, with bitter rorings and dreadfull
shrikings, as is vsed in time when anie towne is suddenlie taken and surprised by the enimies:
for as the c&omacr;mon prouerbe witnesseth; Fier &amp; water haue no mercie: and yet of these two,
water is more terrible and dangerous: for there is no force or wit of man able to resist the
violence of inundations, where they suddenlie breake in.</p>
<p>King William, after that the towne of Bertha was thus destroied and ouerflowed with
<note place="marg">The towne of Perth builded.</note>
water, began the foundation of an other towne, which was after called Perth, by a man of
that name that owght the ground where the same towne was builded. Furthermore, to
aduance the dignitie and augmentation of this towne, the king granted sundrie beneficiall
priuileges and freedoms thereto, that it might the sooner rise in riches and wealth. The first

day. About the same time there rose eftsoones new trouble in Cathnes, for one Gothred
the sonne of Makuilzen (of whose rebellion ye haue heard before) spoiled with often incursions and rodes the countrie of Rosse, and other bounds there abouts. His companie
increased dailie more and more, by repaire of such number of rebels as came vnto him out
of Lochquhaber, &amp; the westerne Iles. King William, to represse these attempts, sent foorth
the earles of Fife and Atholl, with the thane of Buchquhane, hauing six thousand in their

and taking Gothred their chiefe capteine prisoner, brought him vnto the king, who caused
both him and diuerse other which were likewise taken prisoners, to lose their heads.
Gothred himselfe was sore wounded, before he was taken; so that if his takers had not
made the more sp&eacute;ed in the conueieng of him to the king, he had died of his hurts before
execution had thus b&eacute;ene doone on him accordinglie as was appointed.</p>

great warres insued, as in the English historie dooth app&eacute;ere. The barons made sute both

against king Iohn, which cursse was pronounced in a generall councell, which was holden
at Rome by pope Innocent, there being present foure hundred and twelue bishops, and
eight hundred abbats. King Alexander after the deceasse of king Iohn, returning homewards with his armie, thought he might haue passed quietlie without anie annoiance by
the waie, through meanes whereof he lost a certeine number of his men, being suddenlie
inuaded by such Englishmen, as watched their time to take the Scots at some aduantage,
in straieng abroad out of order: with which iniurie king Alexander was so mooued, that he
spoiled and harried all the countries by the which he passed, till he was entered within
the confines of his owne dominion.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, Cardinall Gualo came into England furnished with the popes authoritie, to

denounce the excommunication aboue remembred, against Lewes and Alexander, with all

came K. Henrie with an armie into Scotland, sore indamaging the countrie: but so soone
as he was aduertised that king Alexander had assembled all the power of his realme to
giue him battell, he retired with all sp&eacute;ed into England. The king of England had in his
armie at the same time 1200 men of armes, verie perfectlie appointed and furnished with
armor and weapon as was requisit, and the king of Scots but onelie fiue hundred. But of
footmen there were in the Scotish armie 60000 able personages well appointed, with axes,
speares, and bowes, readie to die and liue with their prince, constantlie bel&eacute;euing, that
to lose this present life h&eacute;ere in his defense, was an assured waie to be saued in an other

the Englishmen held. Then marching through the countrie vnto Carleill, he wan that citie,
and garnished it with his people. After this, laieng siege vnto Norham castell, when he had
continued at the same a certeine time, and perceiued how he lost but his trauell, he left it, and
returned home with great honor and triumph for his other atchiued enterprises in that iournie.
King Henrie being once aduertised that king Alexander had broken vp his campe, incontinentlie got eftsoons his people togither, and comming to Berwike, wan both the towne and castell.
<note place="marg">Berwike woon by king Henrie.</note>

women, pr&eacute;ests and children onelie excepted. He assaied to haue woone the castell of Dunbar, but missing his purpose there, he returned into England.</p>

Alexander most terriblie, for that he had muaded England, and (as he alleged) spoiled churches

they would haue compounded with him at his pleasure. Notwithstanding they being nothing
in doubt thereof, went vnto Rome, and at their comming thither, made vnto the pope their
complaint in most gr&eacute;euous maner, of the insufferable iniuries attempted in England and Scotland, by his most couetous legat the foresaid Gualo: by reason of which complaint, and of
sundrie such letters &amp; informations as dailie came out of England and Scotland, from other

to be paid as a fine for his trespasse and transgressions. And those Scotish bishops, which were
come for their absolution, were absolued by the pope, and suffered to depart in peace. In this
meane time, Dauid earle of Huntington, brother to William late king of Scots, (of whome ye
haue heard before how he went in the iournie made by the christian princes into the holie
land) deceassed, and was buried within an abbeie in England. Henrie king of England,
after he came to yeares of perfect discretion, shewed himselfe to be more desirous of peace
than of warres. Wherevpon at Yorke there was a meeting appointed betwixt him and king
Alexander, where mutuall aliance was accorded betwixt them on this wise. Iane the sister
of king Henrie was promised to be giuen in mariage to king Alexander, and two sisters of
king Alexanders were despoused vnto two great princes of the English nobilitie. These
mariages were thus concluded in the yeare of our Lord, 1220.</p>

<note place="marg">An other legat.</note>
by certeine Brigants and robbers. Within short while after, was an other legat with semblable commission sent into Scotland from the foresaid pope. But king Alexander, being aduertised of his comming, called a councell, in the which one of the bishops (as should s&eacute;eme)
tooke great indignation, to s&eacute;e how couetousnesse reigned in most shamefull wise amongest

<note place="marg">The Scots sore offended against Gualo.</note>
doone by Gualo, when he had p&ugrave;t your realme vnder the censure of interdicting, and the most
part of your prelats vnder the cursse ; because they would not answer him with monie, according to his couetous demands, wherewith he might mainteine his outragious lusts. Which Gualo
<note place="marg">The practise of Gualo.</note>
also (as should appeare) by most certeine coniectures, was of such a diuelish nature, that
though he were sent to treate a concord betwixt the Englishmen and Scots; yet to satisfie
his auaritious desire, he ministred such occasion of warre betwixt them, that both the realmes
(had not the matter b&eacute;ene the sooner taken vp) were at a point to haue entered so far into malitious hatred the one against the other, that it was not like that anie peace would haue taken
place, till the one or both had b&eacute;ene vtterlie destroied. But since these heinous and terrible
d&eacute;eds are manifest inough ; to what end should I here remember them, sith the same cannot
be doone without your great griefe and displeasure? Moreouer, after we were deliuered of this
Gualo, shortlie after commeth another, one shewing himselfe to come foorth of the same shop;
for in conuersation of life he was to be iudged no whit better, but rather woorse: for after that
he had got vp amongest vs of this realme large summes of monie, vnder pretense of red&eacute;eming the christian prisoners out of the Saracens hands, and waging of new armies against them;
he wasted the same monie in riotous lust and insolencie, feining, when it was gone, that it
was b&eacute;ereft him by Brigants. Therefore sith we haue had experience, and are alreadie sufficientlie taught by the dooings of the two fore-remembred legats, to our heauie griefs and no
small damages; we may be woorthilie reputed vnwise and verie fooles in d&eacute;ed, if we now admit the third. For it is not to be thought, that this new legat shall vse the matter in anie
better sort, than his fellowes haue doone before him. And verelie, if anie man shuld demand
of me, what I thinke ought to be doone in this matter, I doo for my part protest, that neither
<note place="marg">The bishops oration.</note>
this legat, nor anie other in times to come, ought to be receiued within this realme, &ccedil;onsidering how the same hath b&eacute;ene wasted &amp; robbed by their continuall exactions. If there be
anie amongst you that hath more monie than he knoweth which way well to spend, he may (in
the name of God) bestow it vpon the poore, rather than to the vse of such vicious legats, as
order it in such sort, that all men haue cause to thinke whatsoeuer commeth into their hands,
is but cast away and clearelie lost."</p>
<p>These words of this bishop (whatsoeuer he was) were liked so well of all the councell, that
<note place="marg">Legats cannot be receiued.</note>
the legat could not be receiued into the realme. After the breaking vp of this councell, the
mariage was consummat betwixt king Alexander and Ione, sister to Henrie king of England;
also betwixt Hubert de Burgh high iustice of England, and Margaret sister to king Alexander,
by reason of which mariages, the peace was confirmed with Englishmen, and as it had beene

companions as had kept him companie aforetime in his lewd misdemeanors, for that they refused now to sticke to him in this rebellious enterprise, he went with the residue that offered to

earnest wise, that finallie he tooke him with two of his sons, and striking off all their thr&eacute;e
heads, sent the same to the king as a witnesse how he had sped.</p>
<p>This businesse being thus quieted, an other insued after this maner: The men of Cathnes
sore offended with their bishop named Adam, for that vpon refusall to pay their tithes he

<p>After this, king Alexander comming vnto Aberden, gaue manie large gifts and priuileges
therevnto, although the same before this time inioied sundrie notable commodities and endowments giuen and confirmed by other kings his predecessors. The buls which were granted by sundrie popes concerning the liberties of the churches in Scotland, were committed by the king to
the custodie of one Gilbert archdeacon of Murrey, who succ&eacute;eded next after the foresaid Adam
<note place="marg">The archdecon of Murrey.</note>
in the s&eacute;e of Cathnesse. In the third yeare after, as king Alexander with his mother Ermingard were sitting at their banket on the twelfe day in Christmas, otherwise called Yule, the
earle of Cathnes, hauing good opportunitie thereto, presented himselfe before the king, and
besought him of grace and pardon for his passed offense. King Alexander taking ruth &amp;
pitie of him, restored him (vpon his fine to be paied in maner as was agr&eacute;ed betwixt them)
<note place="marg">The earle of Cathnes is pardoned and restored to his lands.</note>

<note place="marg">The earle of Cathnes is murthered by his seruants.</note>
vnto all his former honors, lands and possessions. Neuerthelesse the offense that was pardoned by man, was afterward punished by the iust iudgement (as some thought) of almightie
God: for he was slaine as he lay in bed one night by his own meniall seruants, whome he
had roughlie intreated, as the fame went. The house also wherein he was thus slaine, was
likewise set on fire and burnt ouer him, that no man should haue suspicion of his slaughter,
but that it might s&eacute;eme as though it had come by some sudden aduenture.</p>
<p>About this time, or somewhat before, there came into Scotland (sent by saint Dominicke)
<note place="marg">The first comming of blacke friers into Scotland.</note>
certeine blacke friers, of which order the same Dominicke was the first author. These men that
were first sent by him, liued according to his institution, more perfectlie than such as followed:
for as it often happeneth, althings commonlie from a good beginning fall into woorse estate, so
that the successors of those men declined from all good religion, into most insolent abuses and
misorders, and so continuing in vicious liuing the space of thr&eacute;e hundred yeares, at length were
perfectlie reformed into a better rule, by a frier named Iohn Adamson, that proceeded doctor in
<note place="marg">Iohn Adamson.</note>
the profession of diuinitie in the vniuersitie of Aberden, at the same time that Hector Boetius

<note place="marg">The first comming of friers minors.</note>
the selfe same time, were sent into Scotland, as well as into all other parts of the chrisitian
world, friers minors, of saint Francis his order. Manie of them also after his deceasse fell to
dissolute liuing, k&eacute;eping no such streict rules, as both he prescribed, and also obserued.</p>
<p>But now to returne to the residue of the historie. The Scotish people inioied peace a long
time after the appeasing of the trouble in Cathnes, till time that Alane lord of Galloway and
<note place="marg">The death of Alane lord of Galloway.</note>

<note place="marg">His bastard sonne raiseth a commotion.</note>
constable of Scotland departed out of this life; and for that he had diuided his lands before
his death amongest his three daughters, his bastard sonne gathered an armie of 10000 men,
in hope to atteine the possession of Galloway by force of armes; but at length, after he had
wrought much scath in the countrie by his violent inuasion, he was saline with fiue thousand
of those that tooke his part, by the earle of March, and Walter Steward of Dunwald, which
<note place="marg">The earle of March.</note>
was sent against him with a power. The eldest daughter of the aboue mentioned Alane of Galloway, was giuen in mariage vnto Roger Quincie earle of Winchester, who after his father
<note place="marg">Roger Quincie earle of Winchester constable of Scotland.</note>
in lawes deceasse, was made constable of Scotland, which office continued in the hands of his
succession, till king Robert the second his daies ; in whose time this Roger of Quincies posteritie was disherited and extinguished, for certeine offenses committed against the kings maiestie, and then afterwards the office of the constable was giuen to the Haies of Arroll. The second daughter of the foresaid Alane was maried vnto Iohn Ballioll ; &amp; the third to the earle
of Albemarle. Thus was the lordship of Galloway diuided into thr&eacute;e, by reason whereof the

appeased thus within the realme, K. Alexander was aduertised of great diuision rising betwixt
<note place="marg">K. Alexander goeth into England.</note>
king Henrie of England and his nobles, and therefore to helpe towards an agr&eacute;ement betwixt
them, he went to London with his wife qu&eacute;ene lane, and Isabell his sister. Through his
earnest diligence, all the debates and quarels were remooued, and the parties throughlie accorded. Which being doone, he maried Isabell his sister vnto the earle of Norfolke, and in

chance caused the king hir husband to returne with great griefe and lamentation into Scotland.
In the yeare next following, which was after the incarnation 1239, king Alexander (because
he had no succession begot of his bodie) maried at Rocksburgh the daughter of Ingelram
lord of Coucie, a virgine of excellent beautie named Marie, on whome he got a sonne named
Alexander, which succeeded after his deceasse in the gouernement of the realme.</p>
<p>About the same time, Iohn Cumin earle of Angus, being sent in ambassage to Lewes the
French king, died by the way. Also at Hadington was holden a roiall tornament, where
knights and esquiers aduanced themselues by valiant prowesse to win honor: neuerthelesse
the end of all that pleasure and pastime ended in sorow. For Patrike Cumin earle of Atholl
was slaine within his lodging in the night, and the house set on fire and burned ouer him, to
the intent no suspicion should rise, but that it happened by some euill misfortune, and negligence of fire. But yet was Iohn Bissart, with Walter Bissart his vncle shrewdlie suspected
for the matter, insomuch that though no euident proofe could be had against him, yet were
they banished the realme, and lost all their goods by confiscation to the kings vse. After
these things were thus passed, a conuocation was called of the cleargie at saint Iohns towne.
In the which were diuerse prouinciall ordinances and statutes, made by consent of the
king and nobles of the realme, which were obserued in the church of Scotland vnto these late
daies. About the same time also, one Somerleid thane of Argile, the sonne of that Somerleid of whome ye haue heard before, following his fathers steps, rebelled against the
king, sore indamaging by rodes &amp; forages the parts bordering vpon the confines of his countrie of Argile, till at length the earle of March brought him to the brinke of such extreme 
<note place="marg">Somerleids humble submission.</note>
necessitie, that he was faine to y&eacute;eld himselfe, with a cord about his necke in token of submission;
and being so brought before the king, obteined pardon of his heinous offense.</p>
<p>In the same season, Henrie king of England, prouoked by the setting on of such seditious
persons remaining in his court, as trusted by wars to aduance their priuat gaine (during which
time law and iustice haue no place) began to build a castell iust against Berwike, in the same

place where the other was begun afore by king Richard, which (as before is shewed) was raced
and throwen downe by king William, by the articles of agr&eacute;ement with couenant that it should
neuer be builded vp againe. This attempt of the Englishmen had ministred sufficient occasion
of warre, if the nobles of England (considering that the building vp of this castell was contrarie to their bond and promised faith) had not staied the woorke, and so therevpon that beginning of new trouble betwixt the English and Scotish nations for that present ceassed.</p>
<p>In the yeare following came ambassadors forth of France into Scotland, declaring that K. Lewes
was readie to passe forward on that iournie, which he had taken in hand to make into Iewrie, and
therefore desired aid of king Alexander, to support him in those warres against Gods enimies.
With these ambassadors were sent ouer into France, certeine chosen bands of men of warre vnder the leading of Patrike earle of March, Dauid Lindseie of Glenneske, and Walter Steward
of Dundonald, thr&eacute;e capteins of great wisdome, and perfect experience in feats of chiualrie.
The most part of all those Scotishmen, that thus went foorth in that iournie, perished in Aegypt
either on the sword or by sickenesse, so that few or none of them returned home againe.
From henceforth, king Alexander liued not long: but falling into a sore and grieuous sickenesse within a certeine Ile called Carnere, not far distant from the coast of Argile, deceassed
in the same Ile shortlie after, in the 51 yeare of his age, the 35 of his reigne, and of our redemption 1249, his bodie (according as he had commanded in his life time) was buried in Melrosse.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">AFTER</hi> that Alexander the second was thus dead and buried, his sonne Alexander the third
of that name, not passing nine y&eacute;eres of age, was proclamed king. There was no small adoo
on the daie of his coronation amongest the nobles, for that by reason of the obseruation of
starres, it was iudged to be an infortunate daie for him to receiue the diademe. And againe
<note place="marg">An infortunate day.</note>
some held opinion, how he ought to be made knight first, before he were crowned; so that
thus they were at strife togither, in such earnest maner, that it was doubted, least this contention would haue bred some great inconuenience, had not the earle of Fife preuented the same,

<note place="marg">The salutation of an Hilland man.</note>
in causing vpon a sudden the crowne to be set vpon the kings head, being placed in the marble
chaire, according to the custome, without regard to the friuolous allegations of them that spake to
the contrarie. When the solemnitie was ended, there came before him an Hillandman (for so
they call such as inhabit the mounteine countries of Scotland) who in a kind of m&eacute;eter of the
Irish language, saluted him as king, thus: Bennach de re Albin Alexander, mak Alax, mak
William, mak Henrie, mak Dauid, and so foorth (reciting in maner of a genealogie or pedegr&eacute;e, all the kings in order of whome he was descended, till he came vp to Gathelus the first
beginner of the Scotish name &amp; nation.) The woords in English are as followeth: "Haile king
of Albine, Alexander the sonne of Dauid, the sonne of Alex, the sonne of William, the sonne
of Henrie, the sonne of Dauid," and so foorth as before. This Hilland Scot was highlie rewarded by the king for his labour, according as was thought requisite.</p>
<p>In the second y&eacute;ere of his reigne, king Alexander (or rather such as had the gouernement
of the realme vnder him) assembled togither all the prelates and barons of the realme at Dunfirmling, and there ordeined to take vp the bones of his grandmother qu&eacute;ene Margaret, which
being doone, he caused them to be put into a shrine of siluer, the 21 day of Iulie, and

minding to place the same where it resteth at this present, as it was borne foorth toward that place,

able to remooue the relikes anie further, till by the councell (as is said) of an aged man
that was then &amp; there present, they tooke vp the bones of the same Malcolme also, and bare
them foorth with hirs to the place aforesaid, where they after rested in great veneration of the
people. Such as were appointed gouernors (during the minoritie of king Alexander) doubting least the tender y&eacute;eres of their souereigne might imbolden the enimies of the relme to attempt some inuasion, sent ambassadors vnto Henrie king of England, requiring that the peace

might be ratified anew with him and his people, and further to make a motion of mariage to be
had betwixt king Alexander and a daughter of king Henries.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, vpon this motion, both the kings met at Yorke with a great number of lords,
as well spirituall as temporall of both the realmes, where king Alexander (according to the promise before that time made) maried the ladie Margaret daughter to the forenamed king Henrie,
on saint Stephans day in Christmasse, with all solemnitie and ioifull mirth that might be deuised. The charges whereof were borne partlie by king Henrie, &amp; parlie by the archbishop,
who in feasting those princes spent right liberallie. At length, king Alexander after he had
solaced himselfe in the companie of his father in law king Henrie a certeine time, returned
into Scotland with his new maried wife. During the minoritie of K. Alexander, the realme of
Scotland was gouerned in great prosperitie by the nobles: but after his comming to ripe age,
he was informed of certeine extortions doone by some of the p&eacute;eres of his realme against the
poore people, and therevpon determined to s&eacute;e redresse therein. Amongst other there were
<note place="marg">Complaint made of the Cumins.</note>
accused of such transgression, the earles of Menteith, Atholl, and Buchquhane, with the lord
of Strabogie, which were of one surname, that is to saie, of the Cumins. These being summoned to appeare before the iustices, with one Hugh Aberneth, and other of their complices,

The foresaid lords mooued with this displeasure, purposed to reuenge the same, and assembling their powers in secret wise, tooke the king at Kinrossie, and brought him vnto Striueling,
<note place="marg">The king taken by the Cumins.</note>
where they kept him as captiue in ward along time after. Through which aduenture much harme
insued, by reason of misruled persons, that wrought manie oppressions against the people, in hope

s&eacute;ene iustice ministred, was holden in captiuitie by his presumptuous aduersaries. But of this
matter ye maie see more in the English chronicles, about the 39 y&eacute;ere of Henrie the third.

of ofspring, riches, lands, possessions, and mainrent. There were at the same times to the
number of 32 knights of that surname within the realme, all men of faire possessions and reuenues. But as it often happeneth, that men of great possessions and dominion are had in
suspicion with the prince, whereby the same is for the more part the cause of their ruine and
fall, speciallie when they presume too farre vpon their high power: so it chanced here. For
within a short time after that the king was thus taken (as before is shewed) the chiefe author
of the whole conspiracie, that is to saie, the lord Walter earle of Menteith, who was highest in
authoritie among all those Cumins, was poisoned (as was thought) by his owne wife, through
which mischance the residue of the Cumins were so exanimated, that obteining their pardon,
for all offenses passed of the king, they did set him againe at libertie.</p>
<p>This woman did thus make awaie hir husband the erle of Menteith through instigation of an

refusing to marrie with anie of the Scotish nobilitie, she tooke the said Russell to husband, though

season a moonke of Melrosse was admonished in a dreame, where he should find a part of the
holie crosse, not far from Peplis in Louthian, inclosed in a case ingrauen with the title of S.
Nicholas. And not farre from the same was likewise found a stone chest, right cunninglie
wrought and ingrauen, wherein were found certeine bones wrapped in silke, but whose bones
the same were it was not knowne. As soone as the case was opened, within the which the
crosse was included, manie miracles were wrought (as it was then bel&eacute;eued.) King Alexander
for deuotion hereof, builded an abbeie in honor of the holie crosse, in the same place where
<note place="marg">An abbeie built.</note>

obteining whereof all warres ought to be taken in hand) but rather that their onelie s&eacute;eking is to
haue warres, not respecting the quarrell: we are readie to rise wholie togither in reuenge of
such contempts with all possible speed and violence against our aduersaries. We are sent
<note place="marg">The cause of their message.</note>
therefore from our king and souereigne, to inquire what occasion you haue thus to inuade his
realme and subiects, in violating that peace and league, which hath be&eacute;ne obserued and kept
betwixt vs and your nation, the space of this hundred y&eacute;eres, and not onelie to take from him
his two Iles of Bute and Aran, but also to inuade the maine land of his dominions, with such
crueltie, as neither consideration of age or person s&eacute;emeth to be had; but that women, children, and feeble old persons haue passed by the swoord, as well as those that haue stood at
resistance with weapon in hand against you. What heinous offense haue the Scotishmen at
anie time committed either against you or anie other (whose reuengers ye may s&eacute;eme to be)
that they should deserue to haue such crueltie shewed against them? What furious ire hath
mooued you to burne the churches of God and his saints, with the murther of his people
<note place="marg">Burning of churches.</note>
that flee into the same for safegard of their liues? But if you dread not God that gouerneth
all things (by his diuine prouidence) which heere in this world we s&eacute;e; if ye dread not the
saints nor vengeance to come on you by the punishment of the righteous God: ye ought yet
to dread the two most puissant kings of Albion, alied togither in bond of amitie and mariage,
which shall come against you with such puissance, that ye shall not be able to resist the same.
Therefore sith ye may depart with honor, we on the behalfe of him from whom we are sent,
doo admonish you, that better it is for you to redresse such iniuries as ye haue alreadie doone,
and therewith to repaire home, than to aduenture to be brought vnto such desperate ends,
that when ye shall be constreined to s&eacute;eke for mercie, the same in no wise will be granted
vnto you." &para; These woords were spoken by the ambassadors, vpon purpose to put some
terror into the hart of this hardie king Acho.</p>
<p>Neuerthelesse he was abashed so little therwith, that he answered them in this manner.

to know and vnderstand the cause why we haue inuaded Aran and Bute, we saie and affirme,
that not onelie those two Iles perteine to vs and our people by good title and ancient right of
inheritance, but also all the other Iles of Scotland, as we are able by firme euidences sufficiently to proue. And therfore are we now come to take presentlie so much in value out of

Scotland, as ye haue taken in issues and profits out of those Iles in times past from vs. Shew
then to your king, that we feare neither his menacing woords, nor yet anie other violence that

passe vnder our dominion in perpetuitie without anie contradiction."</p>
<p>When king Alexander had heard what the answer of his enimie was, he was therewith sore
mooued, &amp; perceiuing no waie to eschue the battell, but that he should be constreined to
trie fortunes chance, he assembled togither an armie of fortie thousand men, that though

<note place="marg">Alexander Steward leader of the right wing</note>

<note place="marg">The king in the middle ward</note>

<note place="marg">King Alexander exhorteth his people to doo valiantlie.</note>
he were not able to match his enimies in prowesse, he might yet passe them in number. He
diuided his host into thr&eacute;e battels. In the right wing was Alexander Steward, a very valiant
knight, nephue to that Alexander which indowed the abbeie of Paslie. He had with him all
the men that came foorth of Argile, Leuenox, Atholl, and Galloway. In the left wing was
Patrike Dunbar, hauing with him the men of Louthian, Fife, Mers, Berwike, and Striueling
shire. In the middle ward was the king himselfe, with all the remnant people of the other
parts of Scotland, to succour the wings when danger app&eacute;ered. These battels were ordered
in such arraie, that euerie band had a capteine assigned to them of their owne language, to
exhort them to manhood, thereby to win praise and honor.</p>
<p>At his entring into the confines of Conningham, where he came first within sight of his enimies, he called his people togither, and exhorted them to doo their dutifull indeuors like hardie
and valiant men, against those enimies that inuaded their countrie without anie iust cause or
title of warre, and to put their trust in almightie God, desiring him to grant victorie vnto that
part, which had most right and iustest cause of bartell. He further shewed how necessarie it
was for them to behaue themselues valiantlie, and how much it stood them in hand to fight
with manlie courages, in defense of their wiues, children, liberties, and lands, hauing no hope
<note place="marg">Hope of suertie in what point it rested.</note>

<note place="marg">The necessitie of the cause.</note>
of suertie of life but in the valiant vsing of their able hands, so that their whole safegard rested
in this point, either to vanquish their enimies with manhood, or else to liue in seruile bondage
as their slaues and miserable thrals, and to suffer their wiues and daughters to be abused at
their lust and pleasure. He willed them therefore to consider, that not onelie he, but all Scotland should s&eacute;e them fight that day, noting both their manhood &amp; cowardise. But sith their
cause was iust, and mooued onlie in defense of their natiue countrie and ancient liberties, he
trusted they would shew the more hardinesse and courage, namelie against them that sought

onelie bloud and spoile. These with other the like woords king Alexander vttered with bold

<note place="marg">Achos exhortation to his people.</note>
expedient to vse some exhortation vnto his armie, that they should not be afraid of the great number and huge multitude of the Scots.</p>
<p>The chiefest point to incourage them to doo valiantlie, he supposed was the hope of spoile,
<note place="marg">Hope of spoile incourageth men of warre.</note>
and therefore he put them in remembrance, how by victorie not onelie all such riches as the
Scots had brought thither with them (which could not be small) but also all the whole substance and treasure of the realme to be at their commandement, yea and the realme it selfe, if

they minded to inioy it: so that this was the day which they had so much desired, wherein
sufficient opportunitie was offered to shew what reward should follow to ech man for his good
and valiant seruice. But for that high enterprises and famous exploits might neuer be 
<note place="marg">High enterprises atchiued with extreme perill.</note>
atchiued without extreme ieopardie, it behooued them to atteine to these so great commodities
by persing thorough, and ouerthrowing by dint of swoord the arraied battels of their enimies,
which how easie a matter it should be for them to bring to passe, such as well considered the
circumstances, might soone coniecture. For through dearth and famine which so long hath
reigned amongst the Scotish people, their bodies and forces (saith he) are so woonderfullie
inf&eacute;ebled, that they appeere to represent rather shadowes than full personages of men able
to make resistance.</p>
<p>Againe, in consideration how necessarie it was for euerie man to fight without fainting, sith they were inuironed on ech part without meane to escape, he desired them, that
if it so fell out, that they should chance to be ouercome (which as he trusted should not
come to passe) that in such misaduenture they would yet sell their liues d&eacute;erelie, and not to die
vnreuenged. Thus hauing opened vnto them what prosperous hap followed by victorie, and
what danger by the ouerthrow, he thought to haue sufficientlie instructed them to put all feare
aside, and to doo what lay in their vttermost forces to vanquish the enimies. The kings on either
<note place="marg">The ordering of the battels.</note>
side, hauing thus exhorted their people to doo their indeuors, they arraie their battels. Acho
disposed all his best souldiers and whole force of his armie in the middle ward, for that he had
knowledge how the Scotish king was placed in the middle battell of his people: wherefore he
supposed; that if he might ouerthrow and vanquish that part where the king stood, he should
easilie then put the residue to flight. His wings (bicause he had not number sufficient to 
<note place="marg">The battels ioine.</note>
furnish them fullie) were arraied more weakelie in slender and thin ranks: but yet at the first
incounter there was a terrible fight betwixt them, especiallie where the two kings fought: for
they preassed still with great violence on that part where they saw anie danger, not ceassing
to exhort &amp; incourage their men to stand to the bargaine with manlie stomachs, so that on
either side these two kings plaied the parts of verie valiant capteins.</p>
<note place="marg">The valiancie of the kings.</note>
<p>Acho with a band of verie hardie souldiers assaied sundrie times to perse and disorder the
battell where king Alexander fought: notwithstanding he had so great number of people there
<note place="marg">The great number of Scotishmen.</note>
with him, that he stuffed euen the ranks with fresh men where he saw it n&eacute;edfull. Also betwixt the wings, there was no lesse crueltie shewed on either side in the beginning of the battell, till at length the Norwegians, perceiuing themselues ouerpressed with multitude, and compassed in on euerie side, did somewhat begin to shrinke, and first those in the left wing, 
<note place="marg">The left wing of the Norwegians are put to flight.</note>

<note place="marg">Achos nephue is slaine.</note>
constreined to breake their order, fell to running awaie. Alexander Steward therfore, that had
the leading of the right wing of the Scots, hauing pursued the enimies a certeine space, and
slaine Achos nephue, a man of high reputation and authoritie amongst the Norwegians, caused
the retreat to be sounded, and gathering his men againe into araie, brought them against the
enimies of the middle ward, where was hard hold betwixt the two kings, the battell continuing
with great slaughter on both parts, and vncerteine a long while to whether part the victorie
<note place="marg">The maine battell of the Norwegians fl&eacute;eth.</note>
would incline: but the Norwegians being now assailed on the backs by a new power of their
enimies, at length they began to flee amaine.</p>
<p>In the meane time, the left wing of the Scots, whereof one Patrike had the leading, was in
<note place="marg">The left wing of the Scots in danger.</note>
great danger, by reason the capteine himselfe was sore wounded, and thereby all the companies in the same wing sore discomforted: but after they once beheld how the middle ward of
their enimies was put to flight, they recouered new courages, and with great force caused their
aduersaries, with whom they were matched, to giue backe also: and so were the Danes and
<note place="marg">The Danes and Norwegians chased by the Scots.</note>
Norwegians chased by the Scots, with verie cruell slaughter through all Cunningham, not
ceassing from the pursute of the enimies, till night made an end of that daies woorke. King
Acho with a few other escaped out of danger, and comming to the castell of Aire,
which (as ye haue heard) he had woone before, he was there informed of an other
losse which he had susteined: for his fl&eacute;et conteining the number of an hundred and
<note place="marg">The losse of Achos ships by tempest.</note>
fiftie ships, were so beaten with an outragious tempest, that there were not past foure

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"of"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"317"</fw>-->

of all that number saued, the residue being drowned and broken against the rocks and
cliffes. The mariners also, being constreined to come on land for safegard of their liues,
<note place="marg">The losse of the mariners.</note>
were slaine by the people of the countrie, so that few of them or none at all escaped.</p>
<p>Acho being thus abashed with these two infortunate mischances, aswell for the losse and
<note place="marg">Acho fl&eacute;eth into Orkneie.</note>
discomfiture of his armie by land, as for the perishing of his nauie on the seas, got him
vnto those foure ships that were saued, and sailed with them about the coast, till he arriued
in Orkneie. In this battell, which was fought at Largis on the third day of August, in the
yeere 1263, there were slaine of Danes and Norwegians 24 thousand, and of Scots about
<note place="marg"><date>1263.</date></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Iohn Fourdon.</emph></note>
fiue thousand. Thus saith Hector Boetius. But Fourdon s&eacute;emeth not to agr&eacute;e altogither
h&eacute;erewith, who writing of this inuasion made by the Norwegians into Scotland, saith, that
they were but twentie thousand men of warre in all, imbarked in foure score ships, which
comming to the new castell of Aran, besieged as well the said castell of Aran, as the castell
of Bute, and tooke them both, spoiling also the churches alongst the sea coast, and after
arriuing at Largis in Cunningham, on the feast of the natiuitie of our ladie, lost the most
part of their vessels, which were drowned togither with thousands of men in the same.
The residue that got to land, incountring with the Scots led by Alexander Steward of
Dondonald, were discomfited, put to flight, chased &amp; drowned in the sea, into the which
they were driuen. Amongest other that were slaine, a nephue of king Acho was one, a
yoong gentleman of great valiancie. and sore lamented of his vncle, Acho had much adoo
to escape himselfe, he was so egerlie pursued of his enimies.</p>
<p>Thus haue I thought good to shew the diuersitie of writers in this behalfe, that it may
app&eacute;ere how things are sometimes amplified by Boetius, to aduance the glotie of his countriemen, further perhaps than by the simple veritie of those that did write before him, may in
some points be well auerred. But now to proc&eacute;ed. King Acho at his comming into
<note place="marg">Acho prepareth to make a new inuasion into Scotland, but dieth before his prouision was readie.</note>

<note place="marg">Alexander prince of Scotland, as eldest sonne to the king is borne.</note>
Orkneie, sent into Norwaie and Denmarke for a new armie, prouiding ships &amp; all other
things necessarie, to haue made a new inuasion into Scotland against the next spring: but
for that he himselfe departed out of this life in the beginning of the y&eacute;ere next following,
all that purueiance and great preparation was dashed, and came to none effect. The same
day that Acho deceassed, that is to saie, the 21 day of Ianuarie, Alexander prince of Scotland, the eldest son of king Alexander, whome he begot on his wife qu&eacute;ene Margaret, the
sister of Henrie king of England, was borne, to the great reioising of the people. For the
people conceiued double ioy &amp; gladnesse h&eacute;ereof, bicause that both a new prince was borne,
and that enimie dead which sought the destruction of the whole realme. After the deceasse
of king Acho, his sonne Magnus succ&eacute;eded him, a verie faithfull prince, and one that
had the feare of God before his eies.</p>
<p>In the second yeere of his reigne, he sent his ambassadors (of whome the chiefe was the
<note place="marg">Ambassadors sent from Magnus K. of Norwaie to king Alexander.</note>
chancellor of Norwaie) vnto king Alexander, whome they found at saint Iohns towne, and
there signified vnto him, that king Magnus their maister would willing lie giue ouer all his
title, right, and claime vnto Aran and Bute, so that the residue of the lies might remaine in
quiet possession of him and his successors in time comming. H&eacute;erevnto was answer made
by king Alexander, that the lies by right of old inheritance perteined vnto him and his
progenitors kings of Scotland, and therefore he might not make anie agr&eacute;ement with the
Danes or Norwegians, till he had recouered the full possession of the same Iles. The
<note place="marg">In time of the trouble betwixt the sons of Malcolme Cammore and their vncle Donald Bane Magnus K. of Norwaie the son of Olaue subdued these Iles.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Richard South. well.</emph></note>
ambassadors being dispatched and sent awaie with this answer, incontinentlie Alexander
Steward of Pasiele, and lohn Cumin were sent with an armie ouer into Man, which lie
they then recouered (though not without bloud) foorth of the hands of the Danes and
Norwegians, who had kept the same in possession now for the space of 167 y&eacute;eres passed,
but not without some alteration and trouble, as may appeere by the annales of Richard
Southwell, a writer (as should seeme) well instructed in matters as well touching Scotland,
and the north parts, as also concerning the state of the out Iles. And therefore that the
same may the better app&eacute;ere to the readers, I haue thought it not impertinent to set downe
what I haue read in the same Southwell, touching the kings, or rather viceroies of Man,

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"and"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"318"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

and those lies which for a season (as should s&eacute;eme in d&eacute;ed) were substituted by the kings
of Norwaie, though it may also app&eacute;ere, that sometime there was a certeine succession in
them, as from the father to the sonne, &amp; from the brother to the brother, &amp;c: in manner
as if it had beene by waie of inheritance.</p>
<p>In the daies of king lohn therefore (as saith the foresaid Southwell) one Gothred reigned
<note place="marg">Guthred king of Man.</note>

<note place="marg">Reginald.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1228.</date></note>
as king in Man. And in the yeere 1228, one Reginald being king of those Iles, was murthered by wicked persons, &amp; then his brother Olaue reigned in his place. In the y&eacute;ere
1230, the king of Norwaie appointed one Husbac, the sonne of Osmund (surnamed Hacon)
<note place="marg">Olaue, or Olauus.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1230.</date></note>
to gouerne the said Iles called Sodorenses, that is to say, the Ile of Man, &amp; the other Iles
there abouts the coasts of Scotland; the which Husbac, togither with two other capteins
Olaue and Godred, surnamed Don, came by sea, and arriued at Bute, where they wan the

castell: but Husbac was slaine with a stone that was throwne downe vpon him. And then
after this, the foresaid Olaue and Godred came vnto the Ile of Man, where they diuided
the kingdome of the Iles betwixt them, so as Olaue had Man alotted to him for his part,
and Godred the other Iles. But after that Godred was also slaine, Olaue gouerned both in
Man, and in all the other Iles (those excepted which the sonnes of Somerleid held in possession.) In the y&eacute;ere 1237, in the moneth of Maie, Alane king of Man, the sonne of
Godred, &amp; brother to Reginald, departed this life, after whose deceasse his sonne Harold
succ&eacute;eded him, and reigned 12 y&eacute;eres, being but 14 yeeres of age when he began his
reigne.</p>
<p>In the yeere 1247, Haco king of Norwaie sent for Harold king of Man to come vnto

wife, they perished in the seas by a tempest on the coasts of Ireland. Then succ&eacute;eded
his brother Reginald, who reigned but 27 daies, for he was slaine the first of Iune the same
y&eacute;ere, by the seruants of a knight called Yuarus. Then Harold the sonne of Godred Don
gouerned Man one y&eacute;ere, being remooued by the king of Norwaie: &amp; after him Magnus

the sonne of Olaue began his reigne ouer Man &amp; the other Iles, by consent of the Manskemen themselues. But in the yeere 1254, one Yuarus was ordeined king, or rather viceroy
of those Iles, &amp; gouerned the same, till the foresaid Magnus king of Norwaie resigned his
title to all the said Iles vnto king Alexander (as ye haue heard) who placed his lieutenants
there, of whome the first was called Godred mac Mares, the second Alane. And after him
Maurice Okarfaire succ&eacute;eded; and then followed one that was the kings chaplaine.</p>
<note place="marg">Yuarus.</note>

<note place="marg">Lieutenant or bailife of the Ile of Man vnder the Scots.</note>
<p>For the time of the reaignation made, I follow Hector Boetius, by reason of some contrarietie which appeareth in Southwell in the account of the yeares assigned to the reignes
of those Iland kings, if you confer the same with the time of the foresaid resignation. But
now to the matter. The lieutenant appointed to haue the rule of those Iles, now that they
were thus come into the hands of the Scots, was bound by his office to be readie with
thirteene ships, and fiue hundred mariners to come to the aid of the Scots, at all times
when he should thereto be required. After this, were the earles of Atholl, Carrike, and
March, Alexander Steward, with the thanes of Argile, and Lennos, sent with a puissant
armie vnto the other of the westerne Iles, the which those that were greatest, they brought

<note place="marg">The chancellor of Norwaie ambassador to king Alexander.</note>
with much a doo vnder the obeisance of the crowne of Scotland, the residue submitted

<p>Magnus king of Norwaie informed hereof, sent eftsoones his chancellor in ambassage vnto
king Alexander, to trie if he might by treatie recouer againe those Iles: and if he might
not bring that to passe, yet to compound with him for a yeerelie tribute. The first motion
of the chancellor would in no wise be heard, therefore surceassing to spend anie longer time
about it, they fell in communication touching the second, which tooke effect at length in
this wise. King Magnus by his letters vnder his great seale, renounced and gaue ouer his

Norway, foure thousand marks sterling, togither with a pension or tribute of an hundred
<note place="marg">A yearelie pension.</note>
marks by yeare. And for the more confirmation of loue and amitie betwixt the two kings
and their people, Margaret the daughter of king Alexander, being not past one yeares of age,
<note place="marg">Margaret K. Alexanders daughter.</note>
was promised in mariage vnto Hanigo, the sonne of king Magnus, the same mariage to be
consummat when she came to yeares mariable. Further, in place where the greatest
slaughter of Danes and Norwegians had b&eacute;ene made, it was couenanted that an hospitall
should be erected &amp; founded there, for the sustentation of poore folks.</p>
<p>About this season, there were great warres in England betwixt king Henrie and his barons,
<note place="marg">Warre in England.</note>

<note place="marg">King Henrie required aid of the Scots.</note>
of whome the chiefe was Simon Mountfort earle of Leicester, and diuerse other. K. Henrie
being not well able to withstand his aduersaries attempts, requested K. Alexander to send
him some aid of Scots to subdue the rebels of his realme, that had arreared warres against
him. Herevpon shortlie after, was Alexander Cumin, with flue thousand chosen men, sent
<note place="marg">Alexander Cumin sent into England.</note>
by king Alexander into England, who right valiantlie bare themselues in that war which
king Henrie held against his barons, whereof in the English chronicle ye may read more
at large. In these daies (as the translator of Hector Boetius hath written) that notable and
most famous outlaw Robin Hood liued, with his fellow little Iohn, of whome are manie fables
<note place="marg">Robin Hood and little Iohn his companions.</note>
and merie iests deuised and soong amongst the vulgar people. But Iohn Maior writeth that
they liued (as he dooth gesse) in the daies of king Richard the first king of England, 1198.</p>
<p>In the yeare next and immediatlie following, after that Henrie king of England had subdued
his domesticall enimies, there came a legat from pope Clement the fourth, requiring him
<note place="marg">A legat from pope Clement.</note>
to haue a collection of monie in Scotland towards the charges of leuieng an armie against
the Saracens. But this legat was not receiued into the realme, but commanded to shew
his message vpon the borders. He demanded therfore of euerie parish-church in Scotland
<note place="marg">The legats demand.</note>
foure marks sterling, and of euerie abbeie foure score marks. And to the end he might the
sooner purchase fauor to the furtherance of his purpose, he deuised by the way certeine
statutes and ordinances right profitable to be vsed in the realme of Scotland, as he iudged.
But king Alexander for answer herevnto alledged, that the Scots minded not to receiue anie

<note place="marg">The more precepts the more offendors.</note>
statutes or decr&eacute;es, other than such as were ordeined by the pope, or some generall councell: for by a generall rule; The more precepts, the more offendors are alwaies found.
And as touching the request made for the collection of so great summes of monie, it was
not thought necessarie, that so much coine should go foorth of the realme: neuerthelesse
if it were thought expedient, he would be contented to send foorth at his owne proper costs
and charges, a number of armed men to go with the christian armie against the Turks:

hir determined purpose. Of this mariage was corne that Robert Bruse which afterwards
(through want of heires of the linage of king Alexander) atteined the crowne of Scotland.
As soone as Alexander was aduertised hereof, he tooke such indignation that she should

of the prelats of christendome being there assembled. To this conucell were summoned to

But yet did king Alexander, by the aduise of his nobles, in hope of new issue, marie the daughter
of the earle of Champaigne in France, named lolant. The mariage was celebrated at Iedburgh
with great feasting and triumph: but that ioy and blithnesse indured not long after. For the
same y&eacute;ere on the 18 day of Aprill, as he was gallopping vpon a fierce horsse at Kingome,
forcing him in his race somewhat rashlie, he was throwne ouer the west cliffe towards the sea
by a woonderfull misfortune so rudelie, that he brake his necke, and so therewith immediatlie
died in the 42) yeere of his reigne. He was buried at Dunfirmling, in the y&eacute;ere after the incarnation 1290. It is said, that the daie before the kings death, the earle of March a little
before night, demanded of one Thomas Leirmont, otherwise named Thomas the rimer, or (as
the translator of Hector Boetius saith) Thomas Ersilton (who in those daies was reputed for a
noble prophesier) or (as we may call him) a soothsaier, what weather they should haue on the
morow ? To whome the said Thomas answered, that on the morrow [before noone] should
blow the sorest wind and tempest that euer was heard of in Scotland at anie time before.</p>
<p>On the morrow when the skie appeared cleare and bright, without cloud or anie other signe
of foule weather, and that it drew n&eacute;ere vnto the midst of the daie, and no wind heard from
anie side, but all calme and quiet, the earle of March sent for the forenamed Thomas, and told
him that he had mistaken his marks, in prophesieng of anie such notable tempest as he had
spoken of the night before, considering it prooued so lithe a daie, without appearance of anie
tempest to insue. This Thomas said little thereto, sauing that he said it was not yet past noone.
And incontinentlie herevpon came a post to the castell gate of Dunbar, where this earle
of March as then laie, bringing woord of the kings sudden death, as before is recited. Then
said the prophesier: "That is the scathfull wind and dreadfull tempest, which shall blow such
calamitie and trouble to the whole state of the whole realme of Scotland," This Thomas
was a man in great admiration of the people, shewing sundrie things, as they afterward
chanced: howbeit they were euer hid and inuolued vnder the veile of darke and obsctire
sp&eacute;eches.</p>
<p>Manie strange woonders and vnketh sights were s&eacute;ene in the daies of this Alexander the

all the parties of Albion, that not onelie the leaues and fruits of tr&eacute;es, but also flowres &amp; herbs
in gardens were eaten vp and consumed with them. And in the same yeere, the waters of
Forth and Taie rose with such high tides in flowing ouer the banks, that manie townes and
<note place="marg">High tides.</note>
villages were drowned, to the great destruction both of men and beasts. In the 20 yere of

<p>In the 31 y&eacute;ere of his reigne, was the first comming of the pestilence into Scotland, with
<note place="marg">The first comming of the pestilence into Scotland.</note>
great mortalitie of the people, where it had not bene heard that euer this sicknesse had come

Alexander, as the bridegroome (according to the manner) led the bride in a danse, a great
number of lords and ladies following them in the same danse, there appeared in their sight as
<note place="marg">A strange sight in dansing.</note>
it were closing vp the hindermost of the dansers, a creature resembling death, naked of flesh
&amp; lire, with bare bones right dreadfull to behold. Through which spectacle, the king and

quicklie made an end of their danse for that time. In the daies of this Alexander the third,

of men, and longnesse of time are worne away; so that things so profitablie by him deuised,
s&eacute;eme rather by report to haue b&eacute;ene ordeined, than that they are by custome practised. He diuided the kingdome into foure parts, through which he made his progresse almost euerie y&eacute;ere,
remaining about thr&eacute;e moneths in euerie place, there to sit in iudgement, and to heare the complaints of the poore, at what time the meanest person might haue fr&eacute;e accesse vnto him. As
often as he went into anie prouince to giue sentence of law, he commanded the gouernor of
that place to receiue him with a chosen companie; and when he departed thence, to bring
him to the borders of his iurisdiction, where he was honorablie receiued of the next gouernors.
The which trauelling about his realme he vsed, to the end that he might know all his nobilitie, and that he might also be knowne of all others. During which time of his progresse,
no great traine or multitude of courtiers did follow him; bicause he would not charge his
people in receiuing of them ; and for that cause also abated and restrened the troope of horsse
men which followed the nobilitie, and brought them into a certeine &amp; meane number, bicauss
he supposed that the multitude of horsses (whereof in warre there was no vse) were n&eacute;edlesse deuourers of meat. Further, he forbad his people to trauell by sea for gaine or merchandize, when he considered that through the vnskilfulnes of sailing, the rashnesse that
men vsed in committing themselues to the seas, and the rapine of pirats, manie men were lost,
and their goods spoiled : whereby the merchants were driuen to extreame pouertie. Which
precept when it had continued almost a whole y&eacute;ere, and by manie mens sp&eacute;eches was reprehended as dangerous and hurtfull to the weale publike, at the length there arriued such plentie
of strange merchandize in Scotland, that the abundance and cheapenesse hereof did exc&eacute;ed
the memorie of anie former age. But yet to take order with and for the benefit of the merchants, he forbad his people to buie anie thing brought in by strangers, but such as were
merchants of his land, and that all the other people should buie of them such things as they
n&eacute;eded.)</p>
<p>King Alexander the third, being in such miserable wise deceassed, as before is specified, the

succ&eacute;ed in the gouernement thereof, neither taken order in his life time by testament, or otherwise, for anie other to supplie the roome of a gouernor, so that hereof insued such infinit
<note place="marg">Mischiefes insuing for lacke of a king.</note>
misorders, by the presumption of wicked and vngratious persons, the which vpon
hope to escape vnpunished (bicause iustice was like to want due processe) ceassed not to attempt manie vnlawfull acts, to the grieuous oppression of the people: which misruled demeanors and disordered enterprises of those outragious persons, when such as had anie zeale to the
wealth of their countrie vnderstood dailie to multiplie and increase, they thought it apperteined to their duties to prouide some remedie in due time, and therevpon called a councell togither, wherein after sundrie consultations had, and manie matters debated touching the rule of
the realme, it was finaliie agr&eacute;ed that six gouernors should be elected and chosen, of the which
<note place="marg">Six gouernors chosen to haue the rule of Scotland.</note>
thr&eacute;e should haue the administration and rule of the north parts, and these were William Fraser bishop of saint Andrews, Duncane earle of Fife, &amp; Iohn Cumin earle of Buchquane. The other thr&eacute;e were appointed to the gouernance of the south countries, that
is to say, Robert bishop of Glascow, sir Iohn Cumin (a man of high estimation for his
wisdome and experience as well in matters concerning peace as warre) and fames high
steward of Scotland.</p>
<p>But in the meane time Edward king of England, surnamed Longshanks, cast in his
mind, how he might make some conquest of Scotland, now the same was thus destitute
of an head to gouerne it. And for that he well vnderstood that the daughter of

Norwaie (of whom before ye haue heard) was right inheritor to the crowne of Scotland, though
she were but verie yoong in y&eacute;eres, &amp; not able for mariage: yet to compasse his purpose that waies foorth, he sent his ambassadors vnto the lords of Scotland, requiring to
haue hir to wife, and the realme withall, as due vnto hir by good title and right of inheritance. The lords, after long deliberation herein had, consented to his desire, vnder
these conditions, that the realme should remaine in all freedoms and liberties, without
anie kind of seruile subiection, in the same maner and state as it was vsed in the daies
of king Alexander last deceassed, and other his noble progenitors: and if it chanced,
that no issue came of this mariage to succ&eacute;ed them, then shuld the crowne returne by
remainder ouer to the next heirs of king Alexander, without anie claime or pretext of
title to be made by king Edward or anie of his successors in time to come.</p>
<p>Immediatlie herewith, two noble knights, sir Iohn Scot of Albawore, and sir lames
Wemis, were sent into Norwaie to fetch the bride ouer into Scotland: but before their
comming thither, shee was deceassed, &amp; so they returned backe into Scotland againe without

reason of the contention which sprang betwixt the kinsmen of king Alexander, for the
title and claime which they seuerallie made and pretended to the crowne. There were
thr&eacute;e chieffie that s&eacute;emed by n&eacute;erenesse of bloud to haue most right, and therefore made
most earnest sute in their claime Iohn Balioll, Robert Bruse, and Iohn Hastings. This
Robert Bruse was sonne to the son of that Robert Bruse, which maried Isabell the
yoongest daughter to Dauid earle of Huntington, on whom he got a son named also Robert, that maried the inheritor of Carrike, as we haue shewed before, whose sonne this
Robert Bruse was, that now claimed the crowne. Iohn Balioll came of Margaret, eldest
daughter to the foresaid Dauid earle of Huntington: for Alane lord of Galloway, which
maried the said Margaret, begot on hir two daughters, of the which the eldest namd Deruogill, was giuen in mariage vnto sir Iohn Balioll, father vnto this Iohn Balioll, that thus
made claime to the crowne : alledging that forsomuch that he was come of the eldest
daughter of earle Dauid, the brother of king William, he ought by reason to be reputed
as next heire to the same king William, sith none other person aliue approched so n&eacute;ere

somewhat (besides that which is airedie spoken, being here in part repeated) of the descent
of this Deruogill, the daughter of Alane lord of Galloway, beginning the same somewhat
higher, in this sort. In the reigne of William K. of Scots, which began in the yere of Christ
1160, as saith Lesleus, lib. 6. pag. 226, Fergusius gouernor of Galloway left two sons,
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Paruus</emph> nameth him Vtred.</note>
Gilbert, and Ethred, who after the death of their father, fell at variance for the lands of
Galloway, to be diuided betwixt them in equall portions. This brail comming to the eares
of king William, he was desirous to quench those flames of vnkindnesse betw&eacute;ene the said
brethren, and for that cause with indifferencie (as he supposed) he meant to pacifie and
satisfie each part, by diuiding the inheritance equallie betw&eacute;ene them. But Gilbert highlie
taking this partition in grudge (bicause he was eldest, &amp; that the whole inheritance
belonged to him) did with like hatred pursue both the king and his brother, the one
as enuious against him, and the other as an vnequall iudge, in giuing his right from him.
Wherfore when king William was taken prisoner of the Englishmen this Gilbert being of
<note place="marg">Of this matter though not so fullie is somewhat intreated before.</note>

<note place="marg">Th crueltie of one brother to another.</note>
bold spirit (and now by the kings mishap out of all danger, being deliuered from the feare
of anie law) began to vtter his conceiued hatred till this time couertie concealed. For vpon
the sudden, he tooke his brother prisoner, put out his eies, cut out his toong, and not
contented with a simple death (to be giuen vnto him at one instant) did most miserable a
long time togither put him to paine, by dismembring the seuerall parts of his bodie, before
he should die. After which wretched fact against his owne brother, he ioined himselfe to
the English nation, and taking preies on the borders, he did vnnaturailie and traitorous
lie (as it were an vtter enimie to his countrie) rage against his owne citizens, with all
kind of murther and slaughter of battell. In which he did such harme, and so great oppression, as if he had not bene resisted by his nephue Rowland (gathering a strong
power to him of such common people as remained stedfast in dutifull obedience to the
imprisoned king) he had vtterlie spoiled all the countries adioining to England, or else
would whoiie haue brought them into his subiection. For this Rowland a iustie yoong
gentleman, bold of spirit indued with noble strength of mind and bodie, did not onelie beat
downe the force of his vncle, but did manie times (and that sometimes most happilie) fight with the
English, when they spoiled his natiue soile, or that he made anie inuasion into their borders.</p>
<p>At length when king William was deliuered of restreint, and returned into Scotland,
this Gilbert (notwithstanding all his former euils) by the mediation of his friends, found
fauor in the king, and was pardoned of all his offenses, but yet so as he promised to
make recompense of all such damages as he had committed; for the sure performance
whereof, he found sufficient pledges to the king. But Gilbert shortlie after departing
this life, they which had serued vnder him, giuen by continuall vse vnto theft and blood,
did y&eacute;eld themselues to the fauourable protection of the king of England, either for inconstancie of mind, or feare of punishment, being touched with remorse of conscience for the
euill which they had before committed. These men thus shadowed vnder the wings of
<note place="marg">Gilpatrike &amp; other spoile Scotland.</note>
England, did againe take armes against their countrie, vnder the conduct of Gilpatrike
Henrie Kennedie, and Samuell, who before had b&eacute;ene authors and executors to Gilbert,
of all such euils as were by him performed. Against whom was Rowland sent with an
armie, who in a set battle slue the capteine, and a multitude of both kinds of the 
<note place="marg">Gilcombe spoileth his countrie.</note>
common people. They which escaped the conflict, did flie to the refuge of one Gilcombe,
capteine of such persons as liued vpon spoile and pilfering, who by continuance of followers, &amp; increase of people, were now growne to some number, &amp; did wander ouer all
Louthian, robbing &amp; spoiling in euerie place where they set foot: and not so content, did
<note place="marg">Maketh himselfe lord of Gallowaie.</note>
from thence passe into Galloway, where this Gilcombe tooke in hand the defense of Gilberts cause (now vtterlie forsaken of all men) vnder colour whereof, he not onelie challenged the inheritance belonging to Gilbert, but also behaued himselfe as chiefe lord of
all Galloway. At length incountering with this Rowland in the kalends of October (the
third moneth after the companie of this Gilbert was before dispesed) this Gilcombe was

valiantlie slaine, with the greatest number of his followers, by the said Rowland, on whose
<note place="marg">Gilcombe slaine.</note>
part there was verie few missing.</p>
<p>The king of England highlie offended therwith (bicause the yere before they had sworne
themselues to serue faithfullie vnder him against their owne bloud) came in haste with a
maine armie to Carleill to s&eacute;eke reuenge thereof. Which when William king of Scots
vnderstood, he laboured by all the meanes he could, to appease the king of Englands displeasure, and to reconcile this Rowland vnto him. In the end the king of Scots wrought
<note place="marg">Rowland restored to the fauour of the king of England.</note>
so with the English, that Rowland was admitted to come to Carleiil to the presence of the king
of England ; the which Rowland did accordinglie. At what time before the king of England, refelling the standerous accusations of his aduersaries (and further declaring that he
had doone nothing either rashlie, or vniustlie against his and the common wealths enimie)
he was honorablie by the English king suffered to depart from Carleill. These things
thus doone, &amp; king William returned into Scotland, he called to remembrance the continuall constancie and good seruice, which Ethred the father of Rowland had manie times
doone to him and to the realme; therewithall not orgetting the woorthie exploits which
this Rowland had of late performed for the common wealth: for which considerations he
woorthilie recompensed the said Rowland, in bestowing on him the whole countrie of
<note place="marg">Rowland made lord of Gallowaie.</note>
Galloway. And further (although he did not merit the same by reason of his fathers euils)
yet the king mildlie considering, that the sonne was not to beare the offense of the father
(but hoping by this vndeserued liberalitie, to bind him faithfullie to serue him) did giue
<note place="marg">Carrike giuen to the sonne of Gilbert.</note>
the lands of Carrike vnto the sonne of the said Gilbert. All which William Paruus reporteth to haue happened in the y&eacute;ere of Christ 1183.</p>
<p>Rowland being thus made lord of Galloway, maried the sister of William Mooruill constable
<note place="marg">Rowland constable of Scotland.</note>

<note place="marg">Alane lord of Galloway, &amp; constable of Scotland.</note>
of Scotland, who dieng without issue, obteined the same office by inheritance in right of
his wife, from whome did issue Aiane lord of Galloway, and constable of Scotland, by in
heritance from his mother, a valiant gentleman, and such a person as for his notable seruice
(imploied in Ireland on the behaife of John king of England) was rewarded by the said king
with honorable and rich reuenues: for which by the permission of William king of Scotland, he professed himselfe the liege man of John king of England, and sware fealtie vnto
him. This Alane (as is before said) maried Margaret the elder daughter of Dauid earle of
Huntington, of whome he raised thr&eacute;e daughters, whereof the eldest being Dornagiil, was
maried to Balioll, the second to Bruse: in right of which Dornagill, the sonne of this Balioll
challenged the crowne of Scotland, as descended from the elder sister) On the other side
<note place="marg">The title of Robert Bruse.</note>
Robert Bruse, albeit he was descended of the yoongest daughter to earle Dauid, yet was he
come of the first issue male, for his father was first borne, and therefore if king William had
deceassed without issue, the crowne had descended to him: for which consideration he
mainteined that he ought now to be preferred. Hastings also for his part, bicause he was
<note place="marg">Hastings.</note>
come of the yoongest daughter of king Dauid, maried to his father Henrie Hastings, wanted
not allegations to propone, why he ought to be admitted. Beside these, there were other
also, that made claime to the crowne of Scotland, and had matter sufficient to mainteine their
sute. This controuersie being brought before the gouernors, was at sundrie times argued
with much contention, not without the assistance of the nobles fauoring the parties, as
occasion of friendship or kinred mooued them, namelie Balioll and Bruse had no small
number that leaned vnto their parts, by reason whereof the gouernors were in doubt to

<p>H&eacute;erevpon they iudged it best to referre the decision of all this whole matter to some
mightie king, which was of puissance able to constreine the parties repuguant to obeie his

therfore they chose him. [Of whose faith and loue towards them, they did not anie whit
mistrust, bicause Alexander the last king of Scots had found the father of this Edward,

also they ioined this cause of hope in king Edward, for that the said Edward had of late
before tried the fauor of the Scots towards him, by a singular testimonie, in that they
so easilie consented to ioine the heire of Scotland with the son of the said Edward ]
Wherevpon king Edward tooke this charge vpon him, as competent iudge, &amp; promised
by a certein day to come vnto Berwike, willing that their councell might be assembled
there against that time. At his comming thither, at the day assigned, and hauing heard
what could be said on ech part, and throughlie considering at length their allegations, he
perceiued the same doubtfull, and required a longer time to discusse the truth by good
<note place="marg">The title doubtfull.</note>
aduise of counsell: and therefore required to haue twelue Scotishmen, the best learned and
most skilfull lawiers of all the realme to be associat with twelue Englishmen, which he
promised to choose foorth of the most perfect and wisest clerks that might be found within
all his dominions, to the intent that by their ripe and aduised debating of the matter, the
truth might appeere, according to the which he minded to giue sentence, without fauor
either of one part or other. [Before which he tooke a solemne oth of the ambassadors

<note place="marg">The nobles sweare to stand to the order of king Edward.</note>
of Scotland, and such nobles as were there to stand to his definitiue sentence, further
therevpon requiring a writing to be made, sealed with the seales of the same nobles.]
After when all such matters and proofes as were proponed by the parties, alledged by
them for furtherance of their titles were put in writing, as matter of record, he returned
backe againe into England.</p>
<p>&para; H&eacute;ere the Scotish writers report, that king Edward vsed himselfe nothing vprightlie
<note place="marg">This report of the Scotish writers smelleth altogither of malice conceiued against him, for that he scourged them so sore for their vutruths.</note>
in this matter, but accordinglie (as it often happeneth) had the eies of his conscience
blinded, vpon hope to gaine somewhat by this credit thus to him committed. But how
vniustlie he is slandered in this behalfe, I leaue to the indifferent readers to consider, by
conferring that which the Scots doo write thereof, with that which is to be found in our
English historie. But to proc&eacute;ed as we find it in the Scotish writers. King Edward to be
satisfied in knowledge of the truth, sent into France for men learned and of great experience in the lawes, that he might haue their opinions in the demands of the parties for
their doubtfull rights. But (saith Hector Boetius) he first commanded them in no wise to
agree vpon anie resolute point, but rather to varie in opinions, that when the pl&eacute;e should
s&eacute;eme doubtfull by reason of their contrarietie in deciding thereof, he might the better
vnder that colour, giue iudgement with which partie he thought most expedient to serue
his purpose.</p>
<p>Howbeit the most part of the lawiers iudged with Robert Bruse, both for the woorthines
<note place="marg">Respect of persons in deciding controuersies is not to be considered.</note>
of his person, and also for that he was come of the first issue male. But some there were
that gaue sentence with Iohn Balioll, for that he was descended of the eldest sister. King
Edward supposing this to be the time most conuenient for his purposed intention to conquer the realme of Scotland, returned to Berwike, where he had appointed the 24 learned
men before specified, to be present, that finall sentence might be giuen, according as he
had before promised. When he was come thus vnto Berwike, and the foresaid 24 learned
<note place="marg">K. Edward commeth to Berwike.</note>
lawiers assembled as assistants with him, and the parties app&eacute;ering before him in a chamber prouided for the purpose, he caused the doores to be suerlie kept, and the entries
stronglie warded, that no man might come in or out, but by his appointment and licenceHis purpose was to make him king, that would be sworne to hold the crowne of Scotland
<note place="marg">The purpose of king Edward, as the Scots doo vntrulie report.</note>
of him, as superior lord thereof. And bicause he knew that Robert Bruse was a man of
singular manhood and wisedome, he thought best to assaie him first, and if he found him
not conformable to his purpose, then he minded to trie what the Balioll would do.</p>
<p>When Robert Bruse had throughlie heard king Edwards motion, he answered that he
<note place="marg">The answer of Robert Bruse.</note>
weied the libertie of his countrie, more than his priuate preferment, and therefore minded
not to deliuer his countrie (which euen to that day had b&eacute;eue fr&eacute;e) into the bondage and
seruitude of the Englishmen. King Edward perceiuing his stoutnesse of stomach, brake
off with him, and fell in talke with the Balioll, who had such blind desire to atteine the
crowne, that he passed not whether he inioied the same in libertie or seruitude,so he might

(s&eacute;eing the Balioll thus made king, and Robert Bruse without reason put backe) spake in
this sort to king Edward: Oh king, remember what is doone by th&eacute;e this day, sparing
to giue righteous sentence in this matter; for though the same be now couered and hid, it
shall be reuealed, when the great iudge that searcheth consciences, and the secrets of
euerie mans mind, shall cause th&eacute;e to answer for it at the dreadfull day of that vniuersall
iudgement: thou hast now giuen sentence on a king, but then shall iudgement be giuen
on th&eacute;e. Shortlie after, Iohn Balioll went in great arraie vnto Scone, where he was crowned king of Scotland on saint Andrewes day, in the yeere from the incarnation 1292. In the
yeere next insuing, on saint Stephans dav in Christmasse, he came to Newcastell vpon
Tine, and there did homage vnto king Edward for the realme of Scotland, contrarie to
the mind and consent of all his nobles, for that by this meanes, he s&eacute;emed to submit his
realme, (which had remained in freedome vnto those daies) into the seruitude of the Englishmen: but small felicitie succ&eacute;eded therof. * And h&eacute;ere it appeereth by Buchanan, that the
nobilitie of Scotland, which held with Balioll, did also their homage: for being farre
from home, they durst not contend against the power of two kings. Whereof some
taking it gr&eacute;euouslie in their hart, dissembled with the present time, and couered their
anger vnder the cinders of a faire countenance, which yet in the end burst out, notwithstanding this painted shew. For the declaration and proofe whereof, there was shortlie
after occasion offered to Makduffe, by the death of the earle of Fife, being (in the time
when there was no king) made one of the six gouernors of the realme : for this earle was
not onelie killed by these of Abirnethie (which familie did then greatlie flourish in riches
and authoritie within Scotland) but the brother also of the said earle was called into law by
the Abirnethians, for whome the king in assemblie of the states did giue sentence against
the other. This Makduffe after the land whereof the contention grew was so adiudged,
supposing therein the king to be more vniust against him than was cause, and that the king
was not so seuere a reuenger of his brothers death, as he hoped that he would be; forsooke
the Balioll, and appealed to the king of England, before whom he commensed his sute
against Balioll. The deciding whereof was appointed to be holden at London, where was
an assemblie or parlement of the nobilitie, after the English manner, amongst whome this
Balioll had his place also.</p>
<p>The parlement begun and Balioll there summoned or cited, would haue answered by his
<note place="marg">Iohn Balioll king of Scots answered a sute c&omacr;mensed against him in the parlement of England as an inferior person should.</note>
proctor or attornie: but this (not being allowed) Balioll was compelled to rise out of his
seat, and to defend his cause himselfe in an inferior place. Which contumelio when he
durst not at anie time redresse, secretlie he still bare in mind, vntill fit opportunitie
might answer the reuenge thereof. But when he would, and then could not deliuer
himselfe of such disgrace; he returned home with a mind of deadlie anger, rolling
mounteins of choler therein, who still bending himselfe on euerie side to satisfie his
anger, dwelled on this point; how he might reconcile the hearts of his subiects: and
offend the state of the English. Whilest Balioll with this meditation was feeding his hot
stomach, a fit means was now offered to performe his desire, by reason of the wars
newlie growen betweene England and France, as after shall appeare. For vpon this
occasion of wars, king Edward of England commanded this Balioll by tenure of his
land, &amp; tenure of his homage, to come with all the power he could prepare to aid him in
his warres against the king of France.</p>
<p>King Iohn Balioll incontinentlie herewith became repentant, in that he had 
<note place="marg">Iohn Balioll repenteth him.</note>
indangered himselfe thus by dooing his homage; and therevpon sent his ambassadors to king
Edward, as then soiourning at London, to renounce his act touching the same homage,

alledging that for somuch as it was doone without the aduise of the thr&eacute;e estates of Scotland, it was of no strength in it selfe, and not m&eacute;ete to be obserued being doone by force ;
for which cause he would renounce his friendship and allance, aswell for manie other 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
iniuries doone vnto him and his; as for that he would s&eacute;eke to restore his countrie to his
former libertie. Which message when none of the better sort durst take in hand to execute,
a certeine moonke (or as other haue the abbat of Alberbrethie) caried these letters into
<note place="marg">Ambassadors into England.</note>
England, vpon the receit whereof, king Edward answered the ambassadors (whom he
tawnted with innumerable contumelies) that since we perceiue (saith he) your king will
not come vnto vs, we intend shortlie to come vnto him, wherewith the ambassadors departed. Butus (saith Buchanan) could scarselie returne home in safetie : being at his returne into Scotland rather had in contempt of his owne people, than anie iot reuerenced
for such an ambassage.</p>
<p>After this, king Edward the better to accomplish his purpose against the Scots, found
<note place="marg">The league renewed betwixt France and Scotland.</note>
means to conclude a peace with the king of France, and for the more confirmation of the
same peace, the French kings daughter was giuen in mariage vnto king Edward his sonne.
Neuerthelesse (as saith the Scotish chronicle) he purposed (when he had wrought his will
once against the Scots) to inuade France as flercelie as before, notwithstanding anie bond of
amitie or mariage by him contracted. After this, he procured the friendship of Robert
Bruse, and vpon promise (as it is to be thought) to make him king, the same Robert deliuered into king Edward his hands all such castels as he held in Scotland. Iohn Balioll
the Scotish king, vnderstanding that king Edward minded to make a conquest vpon him,
sent William bishop of saint Andrews, and Matthew bishop of Dunkeld, with sir Iohn
<note place="marg"><emph>Ex chron. Abindon,</emph> as I take it.</note>
Sowlis, and sir Ingram Vmfraiuile into France, to renew the ancient league betwixt him and
Philip the fourth, as then king of France ; which accordinglie was doone : and for the more
corroboration thereof, the eldest daughter of Charles earle of Vallois and Aniou, brother to
king Philip, was promised in mariage vnto Edward Balioll, the sonne of king Iohn, which
Edward should inioy lands of yearelie rents &amp; reuenues to the summe of fift&eacute;ene hundred
pounds sterling, in places not of the demesnes belonging to the crowne, as Ballieuille, Dampiere, Harecourt, and Horneie, which his father held in France with Lanarke, Kidion, Maldeseie, Cuningham, and the castell of Dundee, with the appurtenances in Scotland : and
hereto was annexed a prouiso, that if those seigniories and places exceeded the value of
fift&eacute;ene hundred pounds of yearelie reuenues, then should the surplusage remaine to the
K. of Scotland : but if the same amounted not to that summe, then shoud the said king
make them good, and supplie the same with other rents in Scotland, or otherwise, as should
be thought m&eacute;et. And further, the said summe of fift&eacute;ene hundred pounds in yearlie rent
was assigned as it were the dower of the said ladie, to inioy to hir selfe during hir life after
hir husbands deceasse, if hir hap were to suruiue him.</p>
<p>In consideration whereof, king Philip couenanted to content and pay vnto king Iohn in name
<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boetius.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Abindon.</emph></note>
of the mariage monie, the summe of 40000 crownes, or (as other write) 25000 pounds
Turnois. The charter conteining the articles, couenants, and agr&eacute;ements of this mariage
and league aboue mentioned, beareth date at Paris, the 23 day of October, in the yeare of
our Lord 1295. And the letters procuratorie made by king Iohn to the said bishop of
<note place="marg"><date>1295.</date></note>
saint Andrewes, &amp; the other his associats, bare date at Striueling, the third nones of lulie
the same yeare. Shortlie herevpon, king Iohn was aduertised that king Edward purposed
<note place="marg">The gentlemen of Fife, and Louthian sent to Berwike to defend it against the Englishmen.</note>
to come and besiege Berwike; wherefore by aduise of his nobles he sent the most part of
all the lords and gentlemen of Fife and Louthian vnto Berwike, to defend the towne against
the enimie, if he came to besiege it. The Englishmen came not onelie with a mightie
power by land, but also with a great nauie by sea towards the said towne of Berwike. Of
whose comming the Scots being aduertised, came foorth against those that approched by

not so sp&eacute;edie effect as he hoped it should haue doone, he deuised how to take this towne
by some slightfull policie.H&eacute;erevpon he feined as would haue broken vp his
<note place="marg">The policie of king Edward to win Berwike.</note>

siege, and so raising his campe, withdrew a little from the towne, and then hauing prouided
banners and ensignes, resembling altogither such as diuerse noble men in Scotland vsed,
he suddenlie returned toward the towne, euerie one of his souldiers wearing a crosse of
saint Andrewes aboue on their harnesse, after the manner of the Scotishmen. There were
also sent before vnto the towne, certeine Scots that serued the king of England, which
gaue knowledge to the capteins within the towne, that their lord king Iohn was comming
with his armie to their succors. The Scots that were within the towne, beleeuing it had
<note place="marg">The Scots deceiued and intrapped.</note>
b&eacute;ene most true, set open the gates, and came foorth against their king (as they supposed)
to haue receiued him with all ioy and gladnesse.</p>
<p>But when they came n&eacute;ere vnto the Englishmen, they perceiued both by their language
and habit what they were: but this was not before the Englishmen were hard at the gates,
so that when the Scotishmen would haue fled backe to haue got into the towne againe,

<note place="marg">Berwike is woone.</note>

<note place="marg">The 29 of March being good friday.</note>

<note place="marg">1295. <emph>H. B.</emph></note>
the Englishmen pursued them so fast at the h&eacute;eles, that they entered the gates with them,
and so tooke the towne with great slaughter, as well of the souldiers and men of warre, as
also of women, children, and aged persons, without all ruth or compassion, so that they
left not one creature aliue of the Scotish bloud within all that towne. Thus was Berwike
woone the 30 day of March, in the y&eacute;ere 1296. Such abundance of bloud was spilled
thorough all parts of the towne (as the Scotish chronicles testifie) that where at the falling
tide the water was not able to driue about the mils, some of the same mils yet, were now
<note place="marg">The abundance of bloud spilled.</note>

<note place="marg">Streames augmented with bloud.</note>
at a low water set on gate, by reason the streames were so hugelie augmented with bloud.
There were slaine aboue seuen thousand persons that day, with the greatest part of all the
nobles and gentlemen of Fife and Louthian.</p>
<p>King Iohn hearing of this slaughter of his people at Berwike, in great desire to be
<note place="marg">The Scots discomfited at Dunbar.</note>
auenged, gathered his power, and sent the same foorth against king Edward, with whome
they met not farre from Dunbar, and there incountring with him in battell, the Scotish
host was discomted, the most part of the Scots being either slaine or taken. The earles
of March and Menteth, with 70 knights, fled to the castell of Dunbar, but they were 
<note place="marg">The castell of Dunbar rendered to king Edward.</note>
besieged so streictlie by the English power, inuironing the castell on ech side, that in the
end they were constreined for lacke of vittels to y&eacute;eld themselues to king Edward, on condition to haue their liues saued, which couenant was not obserued ; as the Scotish writers
affirme: for king Edward hauing got them into his hands, caused them foorthwith to be
put to death. It was reported that Robert Bruse vpon secret conference had with king
<note place="marg">Robert Bruse occasion of the ouerthrow of Scots at Dunbar.</note>
Edward before this battell at Dunbar, sollicited all his friends in the Scotish armie, to fl&eacute;e
vpon the first ioining, which the residue perceiuing, were so discomforted, that incontinentlie they threw awaie both armor and weapon, and so were vanquished without resistance.</p>
<p>Truth it is, that after this victorie, Robert Bruse submitted himselfe vnto king Edward,
<note place="marg">Robert Bruse submitteth himselfe to K. Edward.</note>
requiring him to performe his promise touching the right which he had to the crowne of
Scotland: howbeit he receiued no answer to his liking touching that request : for K. Edward had no lesse desire to inioy the kingdome of Scotland, than Bruse, as the Scotish
writers affirme. Therefore to cast off Robert Bruse concerning his demand, he answered
<note place="marg">The answer of king Edward to Robert Bruse.</note>
thus, as is said; Bel&eacute;euest thou that we haue nothing else a doo but to conquere realmes,

meaning of K. Edward, returned right sorrowfull vnto his lands in England, hauing great
indignation in his mind, that he had obeied king Edwards requests : but yet considered with
himselfe that he must suffer for the time, till occasion serued to reuenge the iniuries receiued, which he minded to doo, and that in most cruell maner, as afterwards it will appeare.
King Edward after he had thus woone the castell of Dunbar, got likewise both the castels

where they were kept in strong ward ; till at length he suffered the said king Iohn to returne into Scotland : but leauing still his sonne in pledge behind him, least he should attempt anie new rebellion after his departure ; which after was deluered at the request of
the pope. King Iohn vpon his returne into Scotland, perceiuing that he was in the hatred

away by long age, he departed out of this world in the castell Galliard, leauing those lands
which he possessed on that side the sea, vnto his sonne Edward Balioll, who being released
out of captiuitie, was come ouer to his father before his deceasse.</p>
<p>In the meane time, king Edward hauing well in remembrance the warres which he had
intended to make against France, had he not bin staied through the businesse of Scotland,
purposed now to pursue the same with all diligence; &amp; therefore garnishing all the strengths
&amp; forts in Scotland to withstand the Scots, if they attempted anie rebellion against him in
his absence, he appointed Hugh Cressingham regent there, whilesr he should be occupied in

and assembled in councell at Striueling, where by generall agr&eacute;ement, twelue noble men

might the better prouide to resist the enimie. Amongest these gouernors, Iohn Cumin
earle of Buchquhan was principall, a man of great wisedome and singular knowledge in all
affaires, as well of peace as of war. This earle of Buchquhan raised a mightie armie, and
with the same entered into Northumberland, where he wasted with fier and sword all that
countrie. After this, he laid siege to Carleill, but he wan nothing there, the towne was so

well defended. In that season also, the fame of William Wallase began to spring, a yoong
<note place="marg">William Wallase beginneth to wax famous.</note>
gentleman of so huge stature and notable strength of bodie, with such skill and knowlege
in warlike enterprises, and hereto of such hardinesse of stomach in attempting all maner of
dangerous exploits, that his match was not anie where lightlie to be found. He was sonne
<note place="marg">Sir Andrew Wallase knight father to William Wallase.</note>
to one sir Andrew Wallase of Cragie, knight, and from his youth bare euer an inward
hatred against the English nation. Sundrie notable feats also he wrought against the Englishmen in defense of the Scots, and was of such incredible force at his comming to perfect age, that of himselfe alone, without all helpe, he would not feare to set vpon thr&eacute;e
or foure Englishmen at once, and vanquish them.</p>
<p>When the fame therefore of his woorthie acts was notified thorough the realme, manie
were put in good hope, that by his means the realme should be deliuered from the seruitude
of the Englishmen within short time after. And herevpon a great number of the Scotish
nation as well of the nobilitie as other, were readie to assist him in all his enterprises. By
reason whereof he might not easilie be intrapped nor taken of the Englishmen, that went
about to haue got him into their hands. At length, when occasion serued to vse the
helpe of such a notable chiefteine, he was chosen by generall consent of the Scotishmen as
gouernour vnder Iohn Ballioll, to deliuer his countrie from bondage of the English nation.
At the same time manie abbeies &amp; spirituall benefices in Scotland were in Englishmens hands.
<note place="marg">Abbeies of Scotland in Englishmens hands.</note>
Neuerthelesse, this William Wallase by commission had of William Fraser bishop of saint
Andrews, auoided and put them foorth of all parts of Scotland, leauing neither temporall
nor spirituall person of their bloud within that realme. For shortlie after, by publike
authoririe, he receiued the armie that Iohn Cumin earle of Buchquhan had led before,
and constreined those Scots that fauored king Edward, to obeie his commandements, in renouncing all such faith and promise as they had giuen or made vnto him.</p>
<p>This doone, he passed foorth with great puissance against the Englishmen, that held
<note place="marg">Castels woon by William Wallase,</note>
sundrie castels within Scotland, and with great hardinesse &amp; manhood he wan the castels of
Forfair, Dund&eacute;e, Brechen, and Mountros, sleaing all such souldiers as he found within
them. Wallase now ioifull of this his prosperous successe, and hearing that certeine of the
chiefest capteins and officers of those Englishmen that kept the castell of Dunoter, were
<note place="marg">Dunoter woon by William Wallase.</note>
gone foorth to consult with other Englishmen of the forts next to them adioining, came
suddenlie to the said castell, &amp; tooke it, not leauing a man aliue of all those whome he
found as then within it. Then after he had furnished that hold with his owne soldiers in
most defensible wise, he went to Aberden. The towne he found in maner void of all the
inhabitants, but the castell was so stronglie garnished with men and munition, that considering it might not be woone without great murder, he raised from thence, and returned
into Angus. King Edward as then being in France, hearing of these exploits atchiued by
<note place="marg">Hugh Cressingham sent into Scotland.</note>
this Wallase his aduersarie, sent diuerse noble capteins vnto his lieutenant Hugh Cressingham, with an armie into Scotland to redresse the matter.</p>
<p>Wallase in the meane time had laid siege vnto the castell of Couper, but now being
aduertised of the comming of this armie against him, he raised his siege, &amp; went to Striueling to defend the bridge there, that Hugh Cressingham with his armie shuld not passe the
same, according as the report went his intent was to doo. Heere incountring with the
<note place="marg">Hugh Cressingham slaine at Striueling and his armie discomfited by William Wallase.</note>

<note place="marg">The castell of Couper rendred to Wallase.</note>
enimies, the third Ides of September, he obteined a verie woorthie victorie, for he slue not
onelie the foresaid Cressingham with a great part of his armie being passed the riuer, but
also forced the residue to flee, in such sort, that a great number of them were drowned,
and few escaped awaie with life. Thus hauing gotten the vpper hand of his enimies h&eacute;ere
at Striueling, he returned againe to the siege of Couper, which shortlie after vpon his refurne thither, was rendred vnto him by those that were within in garrison. There were
manie of the Scotish nobilitie the same time, that sent vnto him, offering to leaue the king
of Englands part, and to aid him with monie and vittels, if he would onelie receiue them
into fauour, wherevnto he granted. By which meanes, sundrie other castels were y&eacute;elded
vnto him, the which after he had garnished with men, munition, and vittels (according as

friends vnto the castell of Striueling.</p>
<p>Afterwards perceiuing that through scarsitie of corne, great dearth arose on each side
<note place="marg">Dearth in Scotland.</note>

<note place="marg">The policie of Wallase to relieue the peoples lacke in time of dearth.</note>
within the realme of Scotland, he deuised which way he might best relieue the peoples
necessitie and lacke in that behalfe, and herevpon he determined to passe with a mightie
armie into England, and to soiourne there the most part of the winter, in susteining the
whole number of his men of warre on such prouision as they might find within the bounds
of their enimies countrie. He commanded therefore that all the Scots, appointed to go
with him in that iournie, should be readie at a certeine day and place prefixed. But diuers
<note place="marg">Disobedience punished.</note>
of the northerne Scots (as they of Aberden and other) for that they disobeied his commandements set foorth by letters and prociamations, were hanged as rebels and traitors to
their countrie. By whose example, other being put in feare, his commandements were the
better obeied, so that hauing got togither an huge host of men, he entered with the same
<note place="marg">Wallase inuadeth Northumberland.</note>
into Northumberland, wasting and spoiling the countrie euen vnto Newcastell. Thus
putting the enimies in great feare and terror of his awfull name, he brought his armie backe
againe into Scotland, loden with spoile and glorie of their prosperous atchiued iournie.
They entred into England (as Io. Maior writeth) about the feast of All saints, and remained

<p>Edward king of England, being informed of the great slaughter of his people, and what

damage the Scots had doone in Northumberland, returned in great displeasure out of
France into England, and sent his ambassadors vnto Wallase, sore menacing him, for that
he had inuaded his realme in such cruell wise in his absence, which he durst (as he sent him
word) full little haue doone, if he had b&eacute;ene at home himselfe. Wallase herevnto answered,
<note place="marg">The answer of Wallase to K. Edwards message as the Scots doo write.</note>
that he had taken the aduantage for the atchiuing of his interprise, touching the inuasion of
England, in like sort as king Edward had doone for the conquest of Scotland, at such time
as he was chosen by the nobles of the realme as indifferent iudge in decision of the right
and lawfull title of the parties that stroue and were at contention for the crowne. And
further, to the end it might appeare vnto king Edward, that he inuaded England in defense
of his owne natiue countrie, and that he was fullie bent to imploie his whole indeuor to
deliuer the same from all maner of subiection to any forreine power, and to reuenge the
iniuries doone to them by the Englishmen in rimes past; he willed the English ambassadors
to declare from him vnto king Edward, that he purposed to hold his Easter in England (if
God afforded him life) and that in despite of king Edward, and all such as would beare
armor against him.</p>
<p>And vndoubtedlie according to his promise he kept his day: for assembling togither an
<note place="marg">Wallase entred England with an armie of 30000 men.</note>
armie of 30000 men, he entred into England at the time before appointed, where king
Edward was readie with an armie vpon Stanesmoore, double in number to the Scots, to giue
them battell: but when the time came that both parties were readie to haue ioined, the
Englishmen withdrew, hauing no lust (as should seeme) to fight with the Scots at that
time; who perceiuing them to giue backe, incontinentlie would haue rushed foorth of their
rankes to haue pursued in chase after them: but Wallase (doubting least the Englishmen
had ment some policie, and saieng (as writeth Io. Ma. lib. 4. cap. 14.) that it was honor
inough for him that he had inforced so mightie a prince in his owne countrie to forsake the
field) caused the Scots to k&eacute;epe togither in order of battell, and so preseruing them from
the deceitfull malice of their enimies, brought them backe into Scotland with liues and
honors saued, besides the infinit spoiles and booties which they got in this iornie.</p>
<p>But as in the beginning all men were glad to support Wallase in all exploits and enterprises which he tooke in hand, so afterward when his fame began to wax great, to the
derogation of other mens renowmes, such as were farre his superiors in birth and linage,
that fauor which manie bare him at the first, was now turned into enuie, hauing no small
indignation, that a man of so base parentage should so surmount them in all honor and
<note place="marg">Wallase is enuied.</note>
dignitie. Those that enuied him most, were of the Cumins bloud and Robert Bruse.

King Edward being aduertised of this enuious grudge, and new sedition amongst the nobles
of Scotland, had secret conference by his agents with the chiefest amongst those that thus
enuied the high glorie of Wallase, and vpon trust of such practise as was concluded by
reson of the same conference, he came with a mightie armie into Scotland, and at Falkirke
<note place="marg">K. Edward inuadeth Scotland.</note>

<note place="marg">Wallase raiseth a power to resist him.</note>

<note place="marg">Strife for the leading of the vantgard.</note>
met with this Wallase, who mistrusting no guile, had raised a power to resist him: but
now being come in sight of the Englishmen, there rose a right odious contention betwixt
the head capteins, who should haue the leading of the vantgard, which is reputed a most
high honor among the Scotishmen. And among other, Iohn Steward, and Iohn Cumin,
thought scorne, that Wallase a man of so low beginning, should be preferred before them
in that honour: but on the other part, Wallase considering that the charge of the whole
was giuen vnto him by agr&eacute;ement and consent of the thr&eacute;e estates, thought it no reason
that he should giue place to anie of them, though vnto his face, as saith Iohn Maior, the
lord Steward had before vpbraided him with his pride, comparing him to an owle, which
from his originall had begged a feather of euerie bird, and being now inriched with abundance of feathers, did aduance himselfe aboue all other birds.</p>
<p>In the meane time came the Englishmen vpon them right fiercelie, before the Scotish
chiefteins (hauing their brests filled with more malice one against another, than with desire
to defend their countrie against their enimies) could bring their men into anie perfect araie.
Herewith at the comming to the point of ioining, the Cumins with their retinues fled out
<note place="marg">The Cumins fled.</note>
of the field, and left the residue of the Scots in all the danger. Robert Bruse seruing that
day among the Englishmen, fetched a compasse about an hill, and came on the backs of
the Scots, so that they were in maner compassed in, and beaten downe on each side: yet
Wallase left nothing vndoone that might perteine to the dutie of a valiant capteine. But
at length, all his indeuors notwithstanding, the Scots (ouerset with multitude of enimies, as
the Scotish writers affirme) were slaine in such huge numbers, that he was constreined to
draw out of the field, which such small remnants as were left aliue. The Englishmen

<note place="marg">Frere Brian laie slaine by the hands of William Wallase.</note>

pursued fiercelie after him, &amp; namelie one valiant capteine named Frere Brian Iaie, a templer,
whome Wallase perceiuing to be within his danger, stepped foorth vnto hm, and slue him
there in sight (as it is said) of all the English armie. Which valiant act of Wallase cause
the Englishmen somewhat to staie, for doubt of further perill by their vnwise pursute likelie
to befall them. In this infortunate battell, were saine on the Scotish side, Iohn Steward of
Bute, with his Brandans (for so they name them that are taken vp to serue in the warres
foorth of the Stewards lands) Makduffe earle of Fife, with sir Iohn Graham, whose death
was much lamented by Wallase, as one whome he highlie est&eacute;emed for his great experience
in warlike knowledge. Manie other noble and valiant men died in this conflict, whose
names would be too long to rehearse. This battell was striken on Marie Magdalens daie,

<p>* When William Wallase was passed the riuer Carran, where he might defend himselfe,
and gather his dispersed people, Bruse desired to speake vnto him, which Wallase did not
denie. Wherevpon each of them (drawing alone by themselues without any arbitrers to
the bankes of the riuer, in such place as it was narowest, and they might without anie
companie best heare one another; Bruse began to say as followeth. "I doo much muse,
thou most valiant of all men, what came into thy mind to be caried away by the vncerteine
fauor of the common people, and to stand against the mightiest king of our age, supported
with the greatest forces of the Scots: and dailie to offer thy selfe to euerie danger, and that
for no reward assured to th&eacute;e for all thy labors. For if thou shouldest ouercome king
Edward, the Scots will neuer aduance th&eacute;e to the kingdome, and if thou be ouercome, there
resteth no refuge for th&eacute;e, but onelie the mercie of thine enimie. And doost thou not s&eacute;e
the Cumins, and m&eacute;e, and the most of the nobilitie, to follow the English faction? Neither
doost thou consider the malice of the princes conceiued against th&eacute;e? Looke vnto thy selfe,
and thou hast but a few of the nobles thy partakers, and a small number of the commons

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"(which"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"334"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

(which are more vncerteine than the wind) to follow th&eacute;e, whose fortune it now almost
ouerthrowne." All these words Iohn Maior supposeth that Robert Bruse did speake, to
serch the mind of Wallase, whether he ment to aspire to the erowne or no: being in deed
rather contented that Wallase had left the field, than otherwise to reduce him to the part of
king Edward.</p>
<p>To whome Wallase answered in this sort. "The end of all my trauell was not to atteine
the kingdome; for my birth and fortune neither did or could deserue it, and my mind did
neuer desire it: but the negligent slouth of th&eacute;e (to whome the right of that diademe doth
apperteine, and who doth greedilie hunt therafter) made my citizens (perceiuing themselues
destitute of faithfull gouernors) to follow me, and caused me (when I saw them in that
miserie, rather butcherlie torne, than in honest seruitude to be oppressed) to s&eacute;eke for libertie.
Which suerlie I had obteined for them and you, if the nobilitie had not so euillie striued
against me, refrained themselues for comming into the field, and had but sent their hinds
(which till their land) foorth to the battell, at which time I had scarse 10000 men, &amp; those
of c&omacr;mon sort. Trulie if the princes had not b&eacute;ene impediment thereto. I could haue brought
foorth to fight a hundred thousand bold and ch&eacute;erefull souldiers. But now in truth I perceiue the hatred of the nobles against me this day. Wherefore if thou pretend to possesse the kingdome, I giue th&eacute;e faithfull warning, especiallie to beware of the Cumins:
who if they had more regarded the glorie of their countrie, than of secret malice to others,
would not so wickedlie haue forsaken the field, what hate soeuer they had conceiued against
me. It they haue giuen their faith to the king of England, they are not bound to k&eacute;epe
it: in a wicked promise no oth is to be performed. I am now wearie of my life, and
rather desire to die, than to liue in this sort, to see the miserie of my beloued countrie.
Wherefore imbrace you this thraldome (which is so much est&eacute;emed of you) to whome
filthie seruitude with ease s&eacute;emeth more pleasant, than honest libertie with danger: for
I had rather choose willing death with fr&eacute;edome (in which I meane to spend my bloud)
than to doo as you haue doone, because the loue of my countrie shall not depart from my
hart, before the life of my bodie depart from his office." Which being said, Bruse burst
foorth in teares, considering the nobilitie of the mind of Wallase, although perhaps he
nothing misliked the misfortune of the man, as doubting the end of all his pretense to
be, to atteine to the crowne. This being thus doone, they both depart to their companies.
By which conference (saith Leslee bishop of Rosse) this good was wrought to Scotland
(to recompense the ouerthrow of Falkirke) that Wallase partlie by the bitternesse of his
woords, and partlie for the loue of his countrie, did now draw Bruse from the English, to
take part with the Scots.)</p>
<p>But notwithstanding all these valiant sp&eacute;eches of Wallase, when he considered the 
<note place="marg"><date>1298.</date></note>

<note place="marg">Wallase renounceth his office.</note>
infortunat discomfiture by him so treacherouslie receiued, he came to Perth, and there vttering

himselfe of all the authoritie which had b&eacute;ene committed to his hands, touching the gouernance of the realme, and went into France, as saith Lesleus. But Iohannes Maior saith,
that he neuer came there, although he will not flatlie denie it. The same time, Philip king
<note place="marg">Philip king of France.</note>
of France, the fourth of that name, and surnamed le Beau, hauing great ruth in his hart
for the miserable calamities thus chanced to his ancient confederat friends the Scots, and that
chieflie for the quarrell of France, sent his ambassadors vnto Edward king of England, who
had latelie before maried his daughter, requiring that there might be some peace or abstinence
of warre granted. At his request therefore a truce was taken betwixt the Scots and

to his order in deciding the right concerning the liberties of Scotland, which might no other
waies be determined, but by intollerable damage falling to the people through blind desire
and couetous ambition of the nobles, contending for the crowne. The pope (as is said)
<note place="marg">The opinion of the pope.</note>
after he had by good and deliberat aduise heard the matter, gaue sentence with the Scots,

shall well app&eacute;ere, that the pope by these letters of king Edward, was fullie satisfied of his
superioritie ouer Scotland.</p>
<p>The Scots somewhat recomforted h&eacute;erewith, shortlie h&eacute;erevpon chose Iohn Cumin to their
<note place="marg">Iohn Cumin the yoonger elected gouernor of Scotland.</note>

<note place="marg">An armie of Englishmen sent into Scotland.</note>
gouernor, in purpose to trie with the Englishmen for their liberties. Whereof king Edward
being aduertised, sent foorthwith an armie into Scotland, which passed through the countrie
to saint Iohns towne, with great damage of those that were adiudged rebels to king Edwards
empire. All the countrie in manner vnto Forthrie, at this season was subiect to the Englishmen, sauing such few of the inhabitants, as liued within the woods, hauing more regard
to the ancient liberties of their countrie, than to anie desire of preseruing their goods or
liues. Iohn Cumin therefore, desirous to redresse this heauie miserie and lamentable case
of his countrie, admitted Simon Fraser fellow with him in the administration of the warres
against the Englishmen, and therewith gathering an armie of eight thousand hardie men of
warre, setteth in hand to reuenge the iniurious dooings of the enimies, chasing out of the
realme all such officers with their seruants, as king Edward had placed in anie roomes

his comming into Scotland, tooke small regard to the ordering of his field, but diuided his
armie into thr&eacute;e parts, euerie part conteining ten thousand men, and appointed them to passe
foorth to forraie the countrie, and to meet altogither at Roslin, in such sort and time as
he prescribed. Iohn Cumin and Simon Fraser being aduertised h&eacute;ereof, gathered their
powers togither, to the number of seuen or eight thousand men, and determined to trie the
chance of battell with one part of the English armie first, trusting that if they happened to
haue the vpper hand of one of the thr&eacute;e parts, the other two would be the more easie to deale
with. The Scotish capteins resolued thus vpon that point, exhorted their people to remember how they were to fight in defense of their wiues, their children, their goods, and
liberties of their countrie, against such as sought to bring them into thraldome and vile
seruitude.</p>
<p>With which woords the Scots were so imboldened, that minding either to die or to win
the victorie, they gaue the onset so fiercelie on their enimies, that the first battell of the

Englishmen was quicklie ouerthrowen and vanquished. But scarselie had they gathered
the spoile, when an other part of the Englishmen came vpon them with more fiercenesse
than the other before: neuerthelesse, the Scots incouraged with their fresh woone victorie,
got themselues sp&eacute;edilie into arraie, &amp; receiued their enimies with such incredible manhood,
<note place="marg">The second battell ouercome.</note>
that they had quickly got the vpper hand of these also. But scarse had they made an
end with this second battell, when the third part was at hand readie to charge them, being
now sore infeebled, what thorough wearinesse and wounds receiued in the two former incounters, besides the want of such of their numbers as were slaine: yet by exhortation of
their capteins, and the valiant presence of the officers of bands beside, they rushed foorth
on their enimies with such earnest forwardnesse to receiue them, that after a verie sharpe
bickering, they put the whole number of them to flight. Few of the Englishmen had

considering that thirtie thousand Englishmen well furnished, &amp; throughlie appointed for
warre, should be thus in one day vanquished with an handfull of Scotishmen. For as their
histories make mention, they passed not eight thousand at the most: and therefore all men
supposed that it came to passe by the singular fauour and grace of almightie God. But
yet the Scots did not long inioy the benefits of so notable a victorie. For king Edward
heaing of this discomfiture of his people at Roslin, gathered a mightie armie of Englishmen, Gascoigns, Irishmen, and such Scots as tooke his part, and hauing all his furniture
and purueiance readie both by sea and land, he set forward with the same to inuade the
Scots on ech side. The Scots perceiuing they were not of puissance able to resist his inuasion, withdrew to their strengths: by means whereof the English armie passed through
all Scotland, euen from the south parts to the north, &amp; found few or none to make resistance, except Wallase, and such as followed his opinion, which were fled to the mounteins
and woods, to eschue the malice of the Englishmen.</p>
<p>It is said, that king Edward required by a messenger sent vnto this Wallase, that if he
would come in and be sworne his liege man and true subiect, he should haue at his hands
great lordships and possessions within England, to mainteine his port as was requisit to a
man of verie honorable estate. But Wallase refused these offers, saieng that he preferred
libertie with small reuenues in Scotland, before anie possession of lands in England, were
the same neuer so great; considering he might not inioy them, but vnder the yoke of bondage. The castell of Sterling at the same time was in the k&eacute;eping of one sir William Vthred
knight, who would not render it to king Edward by anie summons or other meanes, till
after three moneths siege he was constreined to giue it ouer vnder these conditions; That
<note place="marg">The castell of Sterling rendred.</note>

<note place="marg">This Vthred the Scotish bookes name Olises.</note>
all persons being within the castell, should depart by safe conduct with bagge and baggage
at their pleasure. Neuerthelesse king Edward caused the said sir William Vthred to be
conueied to London, where he remained as prisoner manie yeeres after.</p>
<p>Sundrie other castels were taken by force the same time by king Edward, and all such as
resisted, being found within anie of them, slaine without mercie or ransome. Amongest
other, the castell of Vrquhard in Murrey land was taken by force, and not one left aliue that
<note place="marg">The castell of Vrquhard taken by force.</note>
was found in the same (one gentlewoman onelie excepted) who being great with child,
was in that respect preserued. She was the wife of Alexander Boyis, lord of that house,
though by reason she was got into poore apparell, the Englishmen tooke hir but for some
other woman of meaner estate. She therefore with hir life saued, being suffered to depart, got hir ouer into Ireland, where she was deliuered of a son, that was named at the
font-stone Alexander. who when Scotland was recouered out of the Englishmens hands,
came to king Robert le Bruse, requiring him to be restored unto his fathers heritage, being
as then in the occupation of other possessors. King Robert doubtfull what to doo h&eacute;erein,
for he thought it neither conuenient that a prince should take lands or possessions from
noble men, which had b&eacute;ene giuen to them in reward of their manhood, shewed in defense
of the realme; neither iudged he it to k&eacute;epe him from his rightfull inheritance that had lost
his father, his friends, and all his whole substance in the like cause and quarell by iniurie
of the common enimies.</p>
<p>Wherefore to qualifie the matter, he deuised this meane: he gaue vnto this Alexander
Boyis certeine other lands in Mar, nothing lesse in value (considering the largeness and fertilitie) than the other of Vrquhard were: and willed him to content himselfe with those, inrecompense of such as belonged to his father: to the intent that all parties might be satisfied, and no man should s&eacute;eme to haue wrong in being depriued of his rightfull possessions.
This Alexander Boyis had afterwards his name changed, and was called Forbesse, for that

the Forbesses had beginning, as descended from him. Scotland being subdued by the

constitutions of the realme, trusting by that meanes, that Scots liuing togither with

the most part of all the bounds of Scotland. And vpon verie hate which he had to the

all the Scotish lords to assemble at Scone, where he caused them to take a new oth, that
from thencefoorth they should take him for their souereigne lord, and to obeie him in all
things as loiall subiects. All the nobilitie of Scotland was sworne to him that day (Wallase
onelie excepted) who eschued more than the companie of a serpent, to haue anie thing to
doo with the Englishmen, touching anie agr&eacute;ement to be made with them, agr&eacute;eable to their
desires. Moreouer, to k&eacute;epe the Scots from rebellion, king Edward ordeined Odomare
de Valence to be gouernour there, as his generall lieutenant ouer the whole realme of Scotland in his absence. And hauing thus set all things in good and quiet order (as he supposed) he returned into England with great ioy and triumph.</p>
<p>In the meane time; Iohn Cumin surnamed the red, and Robert Bruse hauing conference
togithers, complained the one to the other of the miserable seruitue wherein the realme of
Scotland as then stood by the oppression of king Edward. And at length vpon offers made
betwixt them, it was agr&eacute;ed, that if by anie meanes they might deliuer the realme out of
the Englishmens hands, the one of them should be king, that is to say, the Bruse, and the
other, that is to say, the Cumin, should inioy all the Bruses lands and possessions, with manie
other preferments of honors and dignities, as next vnto him in all authoritie touching the
gouernment of the realme. There were indentures made betweene them, subscribed with
<note place="marg">Indentures of agr&eacute;ement betwixt Cumin &amp; Bruse, touching the conspiracie.</note>
their names, and sealed with their seales interchangeablie, for the full ratifieng of couenants
agreed in this confederacie betwixt them. Shortlie after, vpon deliuerie of those writings,
Bruse went into England, for he might not remaine long in Scotland, for doubt of suspicion which king Edward had in him, because of the title which he had to the crowne of
Scotland (as before is specified) so that (as was thought) king Edward would haue put both
him and his brethren vnto death long before, if he might haue once got them all into him
hands.</p>
<p>Iohn Cumin (after that he and Bruse were thus agreed vpon articles, and departed the
one from the other) began to doubt, least this conspiracie deuised betwixt them, would not

<note place="marg">Cumin discloseth the conspiracie.</note>
to king Edward, with his counterpane of the indenture, conteining the couenants of the
conspiracie, signed and sealed with Bruses owne hand and seale. The messenger deliuered
this writing in secret wise to king Edward, declaring vnto him the whole matter, as it was
passed and concluded betwixt the Bruse and his maister, according to instructions giuen
him in that behalfe. But king Edward at the first gaue light credit either to the wrtings or
woords of the Cumin, supposing that the same proceeded onelie through enuie, which he
bare towards the Bruse, euer dreading lest he should beare no rule in Scotland, if the Bruse
once atteined anie authoritie within the same. Yet at length, king Edward pondering with
himselfe the whole circumstance, and being in some doubt of the matter, he shewed the
counterpane of the indenture vnto Bruse himselfe, questioning with him, if he knew his
<note place="marg">Robert Bruse is examined.</note>

<note place="marg">He denieth his writing.</note>
owne hand ? Bruse stoutlie denied that he was priuie to anie such deuise or writing, and
therefore desired of king Edward to haue the same for one night, to peruse and scan ouer
at leasure, &amp; then if he were not able to prooue that it was forged, and maliciouslie deuised vpon an enuious purpose, to put him in danger of life, he would forfait all his lands
and liuings that he held either within the realme of England, or else where. King Edward,
because he coniectured at the first how this accusation of Cumin was nothing like to be
true, granted his request, wherein manie iudged he did vnwiselie: but such was the
ordinance of almightie God, that Bruse should escape that danger, to accomplish that
wherevnto he was appointed. The earle of Glocester immediatlie after that Robert Bruse
was departed from the kings presence, sent vnto him twelue sterling pence, with two sharpe
spurs, whereby he coniectured his meaning to be, that the best shift for him was to auoid
out of the waie in most sp&eacute;edie wise, wherevpon he causing a smith to shoo thr&eacute;e horsses
for him, contrarilie with the calkins forward, that it should not be perceiued which waie he
had taken by the tract of the horsses, for that the ground at that time (being in the winter
season) was couered with snow : he departed out of London about midnight, accompanied
<note place="marg">Robert Bruse dooth fl&eacute;e.</note>
onelie with two trustie seruants.</p>
<p>It chanced also, that there fell on the same night more snow aloft vpon the other snow
that was fallen before, by reason whereof it could not easilie be iudged in the morning
which way he was gone, though king Edward vpon knowledge had that he was fled, sent
out a great manie of horssmen after, to haue brought him againe, if they might anie
where haue found him. But Bruse hasted foorth with such speed in his iournie, that the
<note place="marg">He commeth to Louchmaben.</note>

<note place="marg">Robert Fleming.</note>
seuenth day of his departure from London, he came to Louchmaben in Annandale, and
there found Dauid, or (as some books haue) Edward his brother, with Robert Fleming,
2 woorthie yoong gentleman, vnto whome (they musing what he meant by his sudden
comming) he declared into what perill of life he had fallen by means of Cumin, and how
narowlie he had escaped out of king Edwards hands. His brother hearing the matter, consented to go with him, and to be partaker of all haps that might fortune to fall out in his
flight; and by the way they chanced to light vpon one of Cumins seruants, that was going
<note place="marg">A seruant of Cumins taken with letters on him.</note>
with letters vnto king Edward from his maister the said Cumin, signifieng by the same, that
if Bruse were not the sooner put to death, there would insue shortlie such trouble and
ruffling in Scotland against K. Edward, that it would be much adoo to appease it.</p>
<p>These letters being found about Cumins seruant, through means of yoong Fleming, the
Bruse after he had apposed the bearer throughlie in each behalfe, and learned of him that
his maister the said Cumin was in the friers at Dunfrise, he first slue this fellow that was

thus sent with the letters, &amp; after in all hast possible came to Dunfrise, by the guiding of
the same Fleming, where in the quier of the friers church there he found Cumin. And
reasoning the matter there with him, for that he had vsed him so euill, and withall shewing him the indenture which king Edward had deliuered to him, as before is mentioned,
in the end (after some multiplieng of words togither) Robert Bruse plucked foorth his
sword, and stroke the foresaid Cumin a sore blow in the bellie, and therevpon fl&eacute;eing out
of the church, met with two of his dearest friends, Iames Lindseie, and Roger Kirkpatrike;

who beholding his countenance altered, and comming foorth of the church in such hast,
demanded of him what was the matter : I trow (said he) that Cumin is slaine. Why (said
they againe) hast thou attempted so high an enterprise, and left it doubtfull? And immediatlie herewith they went to the place where Cumin lay wounded (as before is mentioned)
and asked of him whether he thought he had anie deaths wound, or hoped to recouer if
he might haue a good surgian. And for that he answered how he trusted to doo well
inough if he might haue a good surgian in time; they gaue him thr&eacute;e or foure other
wounds so grieuous and deadlie, that foorthwith vpon the same he y&eacute;elded vp the ghost.

others, in whome he had euer put a most speciall trust ; but they being corrupted with the
offers of large rewards promised by king Edward to such as could helpe to take him,
wrought such fetches that he was apprehended at length by Odomare de Valence earle of

William Wallase, praised amongst the Scotishmen aboue all other in that age, for so much
as he would neuer yeeld or consent to acknowledge anie superioritie in the Englishmen
ouer his countrie, no not when all other had submitted themselues to king Edward as his
liege subiects and most obedient vassals. It is said, that when he was yoong and went to
schoole, he learned by heart two verses of his schoolemaister, which euer after he bare in
mind, and vsuallie would rehearse them, (when a toy tooke him in the head) as followeth.

in his companie, and there liued on herbs and roots oftentimes for want of other food.</p>
<p>Whilest he remained in this estate of aduerse fortune, there were two that shewed themselues right trustie and faithfull seruants vnto him aboue all the rest, the earie of Leuenox,

acknowledge him for their souereigne lord and onelie king, readie at all seasons to serue
and obey him in each behalfe. The most part of all other his friends yea and seruants,
in that present miserie, did clearelie forsake him; so that sometimes he was left with onelie
one or two in his companie, &amp; glad to k&eacute;epe himselfe secret in desert places, where no person lightlie vsed to resort. His wife &amp; qu&eacute;ene fled to saint Dutho, and chanced to be taken

gr&eacute;eued him little or nothing at all. But to conclude, such was his valiancie and most

Scots were gathered against him, bicause he was vpon a strong ground, he determined there
to abide them: but they being thereof informed, and woondering at his manlie courage, durst
not approch to giue him battell, but sent ambassadors vnto him to haue truce for a time, vnder
colour of some communication for a peace, till they might increase their power more strongly
against him: which being doone, they pursued him more fiercelie than before. Neuerthelesse
K. Robert receiued them at all times in such warlike order, that they might neuer take him at
anie aduantage, but were still driuen backe with slaughter and losse; though the same was of
no great importance to make account of, but such like as happeneth oftentimes in skirmishes
&amp; light incounters, where the battels come not to ioine puissance against puissance. The

Dowglasse to attend vpon him, to the end to prefer him to his liuing and inheritance. Wherevpon the bishop finding the king at conuenient leisure, besought him to be fauourable to this
Dowglasse; to restore him vnto his fathers patrimonie: and that (receiuing the yoong man
into his fealtie and defense) it would please him to imploie him in his faithfull and warlike seruice: adding further such commendations in the behalfe of Iames, as for that time he thought
most conuenient. But the king vnderstanding his name and kinred, spake bitterlie of the disobedience and stubbernesse of his father William Dowglasse; further answering, that he
would neither vse the same Iames, nor his trauell in anie thing, neither that he could (if so
he would) restore him to his patrimonie, bicause he had with the same gratified other that well
deserued it. For which cause being by the king so repelled, he remained still in the bishops
seruice, vntill Bruse came into Merne, at what time (least he might loose the opportunitie to
offend king Edward, whome he secretlie in heart disdeined) this Dowglasse departed from
Lambert his maister, taking with him all the bishops gold, and certeine of his best horsses,
with the which, hauing in his companie diuerse other hardie yoong gentlemen, priuie
to his dooings, he fled with all sp&eacute;ed vnto king Robert, offering him his seruice, and to
spend his life in his quarell and defense.) The bishop was priuie to his cousins going

awaie, yea and counselled him therevnto, though he would by no means it should outwardlie so appeare, for doubt least if things had not come to passe as he wished, he
might haue run in danger for his cloked dissimulation. The Dowglasse was ioifullie receiued of king Robert, in whose seruice he faithfullie continued both in peace and warre to
his liues end.</p>

possessions, at length was (through suspicion conceiued by the kings that succeeded) the cause
in part of their ruinous decay. Edward king of England hearing of the dooings of his
aduersarie king Robert, doubted (if some redresse were not found in time) lest the Scots
reioising in the prosperous successe of his said aduersarie, would reuolt wholie from the
English obeisance: and herevpon purposing with all sp&eacute;ed to subdue the whole realme of
Scotland from end to end, he came (with a far greater armie than euer he had raised before) to the borders; but before his entring into Scotland, he fell sicke of a right sore and

historie more plainlie dooth appeare, though Buchanan say he died at Lancaster.</p>
<p>The Scotish writers make mention, that a litle before he departed out of this world, there
<note place="marg">The crueltie of king Edward as is noted by the Scotish writers.</note>
were brought vnto him 55 yoong striplings, which were taken in the castell of Kildrummie,
after it was woone by the Englishmen, and being asked what should be doone with them,
he commanded they should be hanged incontinentlie, without respect to their yoong y&eacute;eres,
or consideration of their innocencies that might haue mooued him to pitie. After his deceasse, his sonne Edward of Carnaruan succ&eacute;eded in the gouernement of England, who 
<note place="marg">Edward of Carnaruan, sonne to Edward Longshanks.</note>

<note place="marg">Homage to king Edward of Carnaruan.</note>
following his fathers enterprise, called a councell at Dunfreis, summoning the lords of Scotland
to appeare at the same, and caused a great number of them at their comming thither to doo
their homage vnto him, as to their superior lord and gouernor: but yet diuers disobeied his
commandements, and would not come at his summoning, vpon trust of some change of
fortune by the death of his father, for that the son was much giuen (as was reported) to
incline his eare to lewd counsell, not without the great griefe of his people, and namelie of
the lords and chiefe nobles of his realme.</p>
<p>Shortlie after this, the said Edward of Carnaruan returned into England, and in the meane
time Iohn Cumin erle of Buchquhane gathered a mightie armie, both of Scots and Englishmen to resist against king Robert, that he might thereby declare his faithfull affection
toward the new English king. He trusted onelie with multitude of people to cause his
enimies to giue place: but king Robert though he was holden with a sore sicknesse at that
time, yet he assembled a power, and caused himselfe in a horselitter to be caried foorth
with the same against his enimies, who abiding him at a streight, supposed it had bin an
easie matter for them to be put to flight: but it chanced quite contrarie to their expectation,
for in the end the Cumin with his whole armie was discomfited, and a great number of
king Roberts aduersaries slaine or taken. This victorie was gotten at a village called

fortune, obteining the victorie in sundrie conflicts, came with an armie into Argile, and not
onelie subdued the countrie to his obeisance, but also tooke Alexander lord of Argile out of
a strong castell in that countrie, and banished him with all his friends into England, where
shortlie after he deceassed. In the y&eacute;ere next following, king Edward came with an armie
into Scotland, where ioining with an other armie of Scots that were assembled readie to aid
him, he passed through the countrie vnto Ranfrew, and at length without atchiuing anie
notable enterprise woorthie the mentioning, he returned againe into England.</p>
<p>In the same yeere, through continuall warres, there rose such dearth &amp; scarsitie of things
<note place="marg">A sore dearth.</note>
in Scotland, that neither corne nor other vittels could be had for monie: for the ground in

driuen awaie, as booties taken by the enimies. By reason wherof the famine so increased
on each side, that the people were constreined to eat horsses, and other lothsome flesh &amp; meats,
thereby to susteine their liues. In the y&eacute;ere following which was after the incarnation 1311,

of cattell and other riches, afflicting the Englishmen with like slaughter and calamities, as

manie other strengths and castels were rendered vnto him, and cast to the ground.</p>
<p>The castell of Rokesburgh was taken by sir Iames Dowglasse on Feastings euen, in the
y&eacute;ere 1313, when they of the garison were ouercome with immoderate surfetting by meats
and drinks excessiuelie taken, according as on that day the accustomed vse is. In that y&eacute;ere
also Thomas Randall, afterwards created earle of Murrey, wan the castell of Edenburgh.
In which y&eacute;ere also, Bruse wan the Ile of Man; Iohn Maior lib. 5. cap. 1. And the same
y&eacute;ere Edward Bruse besieged the castell of Striueling: but the strength of the house was
such, what by nature of the high crag whereon it stood, and what by fortification of mans
hand beside, all his trauell and inforcement diligentlie imploied to win it, proued vaine for
the time. Within this castell as capteine thereof, was a right valiant knight named sir Philip
<note place="marg">Sir Philip Mowbray.</note>
Mowbray, a Scotish man borne, but taking part with the English men, who feared nothing
the siege, for he had sufficient store of men, vittels, munition, and all maner of purueiance
sufficient to defend the hold for a long season: so that finallie Edward Bruse, perceiuing no
meanes whereby to atchiue the enterprise, which he had rashlie taken in hand, was abashed
thereof: for by force he saw well inough it could not be brought to passe, and by large
offers made to the capteine, if he would render the place, and become seruant to the king
his brother, he could not once mooue him to giue anie eare thereto, insomuch as at length
he sought to trie him another way foorth, which in the end tooke better effect than was
likelie it would haue doone, considering the lacke of circumspection vsed in the bargaine
making: as thus.</p>
<p>After long siege, and (as before is said) no good doone, there was a motion made betwixt him and the capteine within for a truce, which was accorded on this wise: that if the
fortresse were not succoured within twelue moneths next insuing, it should then be rendered
vnto king Robert, and in the meane time no force should be vsed against it. This 
<note place="marg">An vnwise composition.</note>
composition was vnwiselie made, as most men iudged: for euerie man of anie wisedome might
easilie coniecture, that king Edward hauing so long day to make his prouision, would come
in support of them within the castell, and that so stronglie, as would be hard for the Scots
to resist him. King Robert himselfe also was sore offended with his brother for his follie
<note place="marg">King Robert offended with his brother.</note>
shewed in this behalfe: but yet h&eacute;e would not go about to breake the couenant accorded,
for doubt to lose his brother, whose aid h&eacute;e might not well want.</p>
<p>In the meane time king Edward sent foorth messengers with letters, not onelie vnto all
<note place="marg">K. Edward taketh vp souldiers.</note>
his subiects, but also vnto all his confederats and alies, to haue men of warre taken vp and
reteined to serue him in his warres against the Scots, which he intended to folow to the
vtter destruction of the whole nation. There came therefore in hope of spoile, not onlie
such as were appointed by commissioners of the musters, but also a great number of other
that offered themselues of their owne accord to go in that iournie, namelie such as had
little to liue vpon at home, and trusted to amend the matter by some good fortune in the
warres abroad. The countries out of the which it is reported by the Scotish writers, that
<note place="marg">Out of what countries K. Edward had aid of men.</note>
such aid came to the English, were these; Holand, Zeland, Brabant, Flanders, Picardie,
Bolognois, Gascoigne, Normandie, Guian, and Burdelois. For all these at that time were

either subiect to the king of England, or else in confederate league with him. There were
also manie Scots that were English by deuotion, and aided king Edward at this time.</p>
<p>But the number of naturall Englishmen exc&eacute;eded anie one nation beside, insomuch that
the whole annie what of one and other, conteined (as the fame went) one hundred and
fiftie thousand footmen, and almost as manie horssemen, beside cariage-men, coistrels, women, and lackies, but the fame herein belike (as often happeneth) did farre exc&eacute;ed the
<note place="marg">Fame oftentimes exc&eacute;edeth the truth.</note>
truth. For it is not to be thought (as fohn Maior himselfe writeth) that he should get
such a number togither, not for that England it selfe is not able to set foorth such a power:
for as the same Maior saith, as maine men as are to be found in England of lawfull age, so
manie able personages may be found there to passe for able souldiers. But either kings are
not of abilitie to find so great a multitude with vittles and sufficient prouision, or else they
will not streine themselues thereto. Neuerthelesse, the whole number by all likelihood
was great, for many as well strangers as Englishmen, brought their wiues, their children, and
whole houshold-meinie with them, in hope after the countrie were once subdued, to haue
dwelling places appointed them in the same, there to inhabit: for so had king Edward 
<note place="marg">K. Edwards promise.</note>
promised them. By reason whereof the disorder was such, that no warlike discipline might
be obserued amongst them; for men, women, and children, were all mixt togither might
such clamor and noise, through the huge number of people, and diuersitie of languages,
that it was a thing rigt strange to behold a campe so confusedlie ordered.</p>
<p>King Edward himselfe most proud and insolent of such incredible number, tooke no
h&eacute;ed at all to the gouerning of them, supposing victorie to be alreadie in his hands; insomuch that at his comming to the borders, he tooke aduise with his councell to what kind
of torment and death he might put king Robert, for he had no doubt of catching him
at all. He also brought with him a religious man somwhat learned belike, of the order
of the Carmelites, to describe the whole maner of his conquest and victorie ouer the
<note place="marg">K. Edward thinketh himselfe sure of victorie.</note>

<note place="marg">Robert Baston a Carmelite.</note>
Scots: so sure he thought himselfe that all things would come to passe as he could wish
or deuise. This Carmelite, as may appeare in Iohn Bales booke, intituled <emph>A summarie of
the writers of great Britaine,</emph> was named Robert Baston, and had the gouernance of
an house in Scarburgh, of the Carmelites order, he being (as before is said) of that cote
himselfe.</p>
<p>On the contrarie part, king Robert ordered all his dooings by good &amp; prudent aduise,

<note place="marg">King Robert his comming toward the battell.</note>
and with 30000 men, right hardie and throughlie exercised in wars, came foorth against his
enimies, shewing no token of feare in the world, but boldlie pitched downe his tents in good
order and warlike araie, vpon a piaine a little aboue Bannocksborne. Whether he did this
for the great confidence he had in the hardinesse of his people, or for that he would shew
how little hee doubted the puissance of his enimies, least they shuld haue him in contempt,
it is vncerteine. Ind&eacute;ed there were diuerse expert warriours amongest the Engishmen,
<note place="marg">The opinion of expert warriors of king Edwards.</note>
that said (when they heard how the Scots were thus assembled to fight) that the victorie
would not be had, except it were dearelie bought: the wisedome and manhood of king
Robert was knowne so well amongst them, that they were assured he would not ieopard
himselfe in such a case, but that he knew he had such fellowes about him, as would sticke
to their tackle.</p>
<p>Moreouer the Scots by appointment of their king, to the furtherance of his hardie 
<note place="marg">Trenches made by Scots to ouerthrow the Englishmen.</note>
enterprise, had cast d&eacute;epe pits and ditches in the place where it was iudged the battels should
ioine, and pitched sharpe stakes within the same, and after couered them ouer slightlie with
gr&eacute;ene turfes or sods, in such wise that a few footmen might passe ouer well inough; but
if anie great number should come preassing togither, or that anie horssemen came therevpon, the sods would shrinke and fail to the bottome of the trenches, with extreme perill of
the men and horsses, that were sure to fall vpon the stakes set there for that purpose; or
else to be so inclosed, that they should not be able to get out of those pitfals. By the place
where king Robert was thus incamped, there runneth a great brooke or water called

at the mils standing on the banks of the said water. It falleth into the Forth right famous
afterwards by reason of this battell fought n&eacute;ere to the same.</p>
<p>When both the armies were approched within a mile togither, king Edward sent eight
hundred horsmen by a secret waie, vnto the castell of Striueling, to giue notice to sir Philip
Mowbraie the capteine, that he was come with his armie to succour him. K. Robert being
aduertised of their gate, &amp; beholding them which way they tooke, he sent Thomas Randall
<note place="marg">The fight of Th. Randall with 500 Scotishmen in his companie against 800 Englishmen.</note>
with flue hundred Scotish horsmen to saue the countrie from spoile, who with singular
manhood incountering with those Englishmen in sight of both the armies, there insued a
cruell fight betwixt them for so small a number, continuing a long space with vncerteine
victorie. In the meane time sir lames Dowglasse, dreading that his speciall friend the said
Thomas Randall should be ouerset with multitude of the Englishmen, came to K. Robert,
and falling on his kn&eacute;es before him, required licence to go foorth to the support of them
that were thus fighting with their enimies: which bicause the king would not grant at the
first, he rushed foorth of the campe without licence, hauing in his companie a small band
of men, but yet chosen out for the purpose, that if it were but by shewing himselfe, h&eacute;e
might put the enimies in some feare.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, when he was come n&eacute;ere to the place where they fought, and saw how
the Scots had got the victorie with great murther of the Englishmen, be staied and went
no further; least he should by his comming s&eacute;eme to ber&eacute;eue them the glorie of the
victorie, which had woone it with so great prowesse &amp; singular valiancie. All those in the
Scotish campe were relieued, in good hope of greater successe to follow in the whole enterprise by so happie a beginning. The Englishmen passed litle thereof, but yet for that the
<note place="marg">The Englishmen determine to giue battell.</note>

<note place="marg">King Robert prepareth to receiue the enimies by battell.</note>
Scots should not waxe proud, and take ouermuch courage thereby, they determined to giue
them battell the next morow. King Robert with great diligence caused his people to prepare themselues readie to receiue the enimies, though he was nothing able to match them
in number, deuising which waie he might traine them into the ditches before prepared. He
commanded through the armie that euerie man should on the next morow receiue the
sacrament of the Lords bodie, through the which they might haue the better hope of victorie
against the vniust inuaders of their realme and countrie.</p>
<p>On the other side, the Englishmen trused that all things would prosper with them, euen
as they could best deuise: for by one small daies labour they hoped to be lords of all Scotland, and to dispose of the lands and goods of their enimies, as should s&eacute;eme to them good,
and most for their owne auaile. But king Robert all the night before the battell tooke
litle rest, hauing great care in his mind for the suertie of his armie, one while reuoluing in
his consideration this chance, and an other while that; yea and sometimes he fell to deuout contemplation, making his praier to God and saint Phillane, whose arme as it was set
<note place="marg">Saint Phillane.</note>
and inclosed in a siluer case, he supposed had b&eacute;ene the same time within his tent, trusting
the better fortune to follow by presence thereof. In the meane time, as he was thus making his praiers, the case suddenlie opened, and clapped to againe. The kings chapleine
<note place="marg">A subtill chapleine.</note>
being present, astonied therewith, went to the altar where the case stood, and finding the
arme within it, he cried to the king &amp; other that were present, how there was a great
miracle wrought, confessing that he brought the emptie case to the field, and left the arme
at home, least that relike should haue beene lost in the field, if anie thing chanced to the
armie otherwise than well.</p>
<p>The king verie ioifull of this miracle, passed the remnant of the night in praier and

thankesgiuing. On the morow he caused all his folks to heare diuine seruice, and to receiue the sacrament, as ouer night he had appointed. The abbat of Inchchaffraie did celebrate before the king that day, and ministred vnto him and other of the nobles, the communion, other priests being appointed to minister the same vnto the residue of the armie.
After this, when seruice was ended, the king called the people to his standard, and first

them by king Edward, not of one nation or dominion, but of sundrie languages and parties,
as well subiects as alies to the Englishmen, with full purpose vtterlie to extinguish the
Scotish name and memorie, and to plant themselues in their seates and roomes, as in possessions vtterlie voided of all the ancient and former inhabitants. To increase the fierce
stomachs of the Scotishmen against the enimies, he recounted vnto them what he heard by
credible report touching the menacing woords and insolent brags of the same enimies, able
to mooue verie quiet minds vnto full indignation. Againe, to auoid feare out of their harts,
which they might conceiue by reason of the multitude of their aduersaries, he rehearsed
what a number of rascals were amongest them, without anie skill of warrelike affaires, not
taken vp by choise and election in appointed musters, but resorting without difference togither, in hope of spoile and booties, hauing not else wherevpon to liue at home in their
countries.</p>
<p>Moreouer, if nothing else might raise their harts in hope of victoric, their iust cause sith
they came in defense of their countrie against iniurious inuaders, was matter sufficient to aduance their manlie stomachs, in trust of Gods aid in that quarell, hauing partlie assured
them thereof, by notable miracles shewed in the night last passed. Hereto he added, that
the greater multitude there was of the enimies, the more spoile and riches was to be got,
if they atteined the victorie. Finallie, the more to stirre their harts to doo valiantlie, he required them of one thing, which he trusted (their manhood being such) they would not
thinke hard for them to atchiue, and this was, that euerie of them would but dispatch one
of the enimies, which if they performed, he promised them assured victorie. As for ten
thousand, he knew to be amongst them of such approoued souldiers, and old men of war,
as he durst safelie vndertake for them that they would slea two of the enimies a p&eacute;ece, at
the least. Such manner of persuasions king Robert vsed to incourage his people.</p>
<p>* But lohannes Maior, lib. 5. cap. 2. putteth sp&eacute;ech much different from this, in the
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
mouth of Bruse, further saieng, that when this oration was ended, that the king came downe
the hill, on which he stood, when he vttered these woords, and bareheaded imbraced all
the nobilitie in his armes, and after turning himselfe to the whole armie, he reached to
euerie man his hand, in signe of amitie: but I suppose he was ouerwearied before he had
shaken 35000 men by the hands.) On the other part, king Edward caused the coronels
<note place="marg">The exhortation of king Edward.</note>
of ech nation within his campe, to exhort their retinues to remember, that if they fought
valiantlie for one houre or two, they should purchase infinit riches with the whole realme
of Scotland, in reward of their labour: for he desired nothing for himselfe, but the superioritie. Againe, he willed they should haue in remembrance what irrecouerable shame
would follow (sith they had departed out of their countries in hope of gaine) to returne
home with emptie hands, and void of victorie, not without some reproch and note of cowardise.</p>

which cause our archers, before the strength of the maine battell shall ioine, will soone
subdue them. Maruell not that they haue before time subdued some of my subiects, because they did it by their accustomed deceits, and not by strength of battell. And though
by chance they haue ouercome (in fight) some weake companie of equall number vnto

<note place="marg">King Robert killeth an Englishman.</note>
this happened (which though it be a small thing to put in writing, yet was such as oftentimes it chanceth in battell, and as brought no small benefit to the perfection of their businesse) that king Robert (who continuallie rode before the battell appointed to his gouernement) holding a mace of warre in his hand (and k&eacute;eping the first order in the arraie) was
espied of an Englishman that knew him verie well: and forthwith rode full against Bruse
with his speare. But the king beating the stroke aside, came to his English aduersarie, ouerthrew him by the force of his horsse, in the end killed him with his mace &amp; so left him
dead. Wherevpon, the common people beholding the valure of their king and capteine,
did with great force by the instigation of their fierce and fierie minds (and not by the kings
persuasion) fall vpon their enimies in such sort, that they s&eacute;emed to haue had the victorie
of the aduerse battell of their enimies: had it not b&eacute;ene for the English archers, which
were placed in the wings of the battell; whom Bruse (sending out certeine light horssemen) did soone represse: whereby the Scots incouraged, made their partie good, rather by
hidden policie, than prepared force. For a stratagem by the Scots deuised, and an error
by the English therof conceiued, did far more hurt to the enimie, than the power assembled
in the field. For that deuise in the end was the cause that the English lost the victorie, being in this sort.]</p>
<p>The Scots which were appointed to attend the carriage, as carters, wainemen, lackies, and
the women, beholding in what danger their maisters, friends, &amp; countriemen stood, put on
shirts, smocks, and other white linnen aloft vpon their vsuall garments, and herewith binding towels and napkins to their speares, and to other such staues as they got in their hands,
placed themselues as well as they could in arraie of battell, and so making a great muster
and shew anew, came downe the hill side in the face of their enimies, with such a terrible
noise and hideous clamor, that the Englishmen fighting as then with most furie against the
Scots with vncerteine victorie, and beholding this new reenforce comming downe the hill
vpon their faces, supposing verelie it had beene some new armie, their hearts began to faint,
<note place="marg">The Englishmens hearts begin to faint.</note>

<note place="marg">The Englishmen put to flight.</note>
the more in deed, for that they saw themselues vneth able to susteine the violent incounter
of the Scots then present. And herevpon they began to turne their backs, and fell to
running away as people clearelie vanquished: on whome the Scots followed with insatiable
ire, and slue them down on all sides where they might ouertake them. Sir lames Dowglas
with foure hundred chosen horssemen, was commanded by king Robert to pursue the king
of England with all sp&eacute;ed, to trie if he might ouertake him.</p>
<p>Dowglas (according to his charge) followed him in chase to Dunbar, &amp; casting betwixt
that and the borders, laie in wait to haue taken him, if he had returned by land; but he
being receiued into the castell of Dunbar by Patrike Dunbar erle of March, with fift&eacute;ene

earles in his companie, was by the same earle of March conueied into certeine vessels, lieng
there at anchor, with the which he passed alongst by the shore into England, to shew an

fiftie thousand Englishmen (as the Scotish writers affirme) amongst whome was the earle
of Glocester, with two hundred knights. On the Scotish part were slaine about foure

Rosse. The spoile was so great of gold, siluer, and other iewels gotten in the field, that the
whole number of the Scotish armie was made rich thereby: and besides this, they got
little lesse monie and riches by ransoming of prisoners taken at this battell, than of spoile
gotten in the fight, campe, and field. But the death of sir Giles Argentine, that died

which were found in the English campe, were distributed to the abbeies and monasteries of
the realme, to make thereof vestments, copes, and frontals for altars. The Carmelite frier,
of whome ye heard before, brought thither by king Edward to describe the victorie of the
Englishmen, was taken prisoner amongst other, and commanded by king Robert to write
contrarilie the victorie of the Scots, according as he had s&eacute;ene: who therevpon gathered his
rustie wits togither, &amp; made certeine rude verses beginning thus.

<p>There be some that haue iudged, how this victorie was atteined by the singular fauor of
almightie God, by reason of miracles which they rehearse to happen at the same time. The
night before the day of the battell, there came to the abbeie of Glastenburie two men in
complet armour, desiring to lodge there all night: the abbat k&eacute;eping an house of great
hospitalitie, receiued them right gladlie, and making them good cheare, demanded what
<note place="marg">Miracles if ye list to bel&eacute;eue them.</note>
they were, and whither they were going: who answered that they were the seruants of
God, and going to helpe the Scots at Bannoxsborne. On the morrow the chamberlaine
found them departed before anie of the gates were opened, &amp; the beds faire made, and not
stirred otherwise than as they left them ouer night. The same day that the battell was
foughten, a knight clad in faire bright armour, declared to the people at Aberden, how the
Scots had gotten a famous victorie against the Englishmen, and was s&eacute;ene shortlie after to
passe ouer Pictland Firth on horssebacke. It was supposed by the people that this was saint
Magnus, sometime prince of Orkenie, and for that cause king Robert endowed the church
of Orkenie with fiue poundes sterling of the customes of Aberden, to furnish the same
church, with bread, wine, and wax.</p>
<p>Manie noble men for their approoued manhood shewed in this conflict, were highlie rewarded at the hands of king Robert. One Robert Fleming, by whose means he reuenged
<note place="marg">Robert Fleming rewarded for his faithfull seruice.</note>
the treason wrought against him by Iohn Cumin, with slaughter of the same Iohn, had the
lands of Cumnernald giuen him, which were of the inheritance belonging to the said Cumin.
It is reported by writers, that two knights of Brabant that serued amongest the Englishmen,
chanced to heare manie reprochfull words spoken in the English campe against king Robert,
who being somewhat mooued therewith, and misliking such dismeasured talke, wished in
words that the victorie might chance vnto him. For the which wish K. Edward informed
thereof, caused them by a trumpet to be conueied vnto the Scotish campe, with commandement to aid king Robert to the vttermost of their powers, purposing to punish them according to his mind, if he atteined the victorie, as he had no doubt but he should. Herevpon, before the ioining of the battels, he caused proclamation to be made, that whosoeuer
<note place="marg">A proclamation.</note>
brought their heads vnto him, should haue an hundred marks in reward.</p>
<p>King Robert hearing in what danger they had run for his sake, rewarded them with
great riches of the spoile got in the field, with the which they returning into Brabant, built
a goodlie house in Antuerpe, naming the same Scotland, and causing the Scotish armes, and

And this was doone for a memoriall, to shew what loue and hartie beneuolence these two
knights bare towards king Robert and his people, for the great liberalitie receiued at his
hands. This glorious victorie chanced to the Scots on the day of the natiuitie of saint Iohn

<p>* About this time for the varietie of fortune (in so small a course of yeares) happened
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan.</emph></note>
a thing not vnwoorthie the reporting. For Iohn Mentith, which before betraied his d&eacute;ere
friend Wallase to the English, being theerefore (as of right he ought) extremelie hated of
the Scots, was (in recompense thereof beside manie other rewards) benefited with the
<note place="marg">Iohn Mentitl made capteine of Dunbriton castle.</note>
gardianship of the castle of Dunbriton: which fort (after all the other castles before said
were recouered to the Scots) was almost the onlie thing (except some few others) that remained in the hands of the English: and because this fort was by nature inexpugnable,
king Robert dealt with the capteine (by such as were friends and of kinred vnto him) to
betraie the castle into his hands, promising great recompense therefore. Wherevnto this
Mentith by no means would agr&eacute;e, vnles K. Robert would giue to him the earledome of
Lennox for his reward. Wherevpon the king being greatlie in doubt what to say therein,
(though in d&eacute;ed he vehementlie longed for the said castle) because he did not thinke the
obteining thereof to be of such good vnto him, as that he would therefore offend or loose
the earle of Lennox; who had in all his calamities b&eacute;ene the most certeine, and almost the
onelie friend of the king: which doubt, when the earle vnderstood; he foorthwith came
vnto him, willing him in no wise to refuse the condition; whervpon the bargaine was concluded betw&eacute;ene Iohn Mentith and the king, and that in such sort, as it was most solemnelie
confirmed.</p>
<p>Now, when the king should come to receiue this castle (according to compositions) as he
was in the wood Colchon, a mile distant from the same, a certeine carpentar called Rowland
<note place="marg">Englishmen inclosed in a cellar to kill king Robert after his enterance into Dunbriton castle.</note>
came thither secretlie vnto him, &amp; desired licence that he might speake to the king, for he
would discouer a great matter touching a treason that was deuised and prepared against him,
by the capteine of Dunbriton. Which pardon obteined, he opened vnto Bruse, that below
in the wine-cellar of the castle, were a number of English inclosed, which at dinner should
either take or kill the king (being then safe) after that he had obteined the castle. Wherevpon the king nothing abashed, but k&eacute;eping on his former determination, &amp; being (according
to appointment) receiued by the said Iohn Mentith in the castle of Dunbriton: after that
he had searched all other places, and was courteouslie inuited to sit downe to dinner; answered that he would not eate, vntill he had looked into the cellar below. Wherevnto for
excuse, and to defer the time, the capteine answered that the smith was absent and caried
the key away with him. But the king not waiting for the comming of the smith, did incontinentlie breake open the cellar doore, whereby all the deceit appeared. After which, the
armed men were brought foorth before the king, who being seuerallie examined, confessed
the whole matter; and further, that there was a ship readie in the hauen to haue caried the
K. prisoner into England, if they had taken him aliue. Wherevpon the rest being punished,
Iohn Mentith was onelie cast into prison, &amp; reserued from further paine: because the king
would not offend his friends &amp; kinred in so dangerous a time as that was. For this Mentith
had manie beautifull daughters maried to men of great power &amp; riches. After which imprisonment of this Mentith was by mediation of such as greatlie fauored him, restored to
the fauor of Bruse, vnder whome he did after serue most faithfullie.</p>
<p>Immediatlie after, king Robert called a parlement at Aire, where, by consent of the thr&eacute;e

states he was confirmed king, and the crowne intailed to the heires male of his bodie lawfullie begotten, and for want of such heires, to remaine vnto his brother Edward Bruse,
and to the heires male of his bodie; and if he chanced to die without such heires, then
should the crowne descend to Margerie the daughter of king Robert, and to the heires generall
of hir bodie by lawfull succession. In which parlement it was further decr&eacute;ed, that if the
king were in his minoritie, he should then be gouerned by Thomas Randolph, and if anie
misfortune chanced vnto the said Randolph, that then the gouernement of the kings person and kingdome should be committed to Iames Dowglasse.</p>
<p>This Margerie was gotten by king Robert on the earle of Mar his sister, his first wife, and
was maried by the aduise of his nobles vnto Walter great Steward of Scotland. Also king

<note place="marg">The issue of king Robert by his second wife.</note>
the one named Margaret, and the other Mauld. The first was maried to the earle of Sutherland, and bare him a sonne named Iohn: the second departed this world in hir infancie. After the mariage solemnized betwixt his daughter Margerie, and the foresaid Walter Steward,
king Robert went through all the bounds of his realme, and did not onelie confirme the ancient liberties and priuileges of the hurrowes and townes in all places where he came, but also
<note place="marg">Liberties by king Robert.</note>
augmented the same, and granted vnto diuerse, aswell townes as baronies, sundrie new prerogatiues and franchises, as may appeare by his charters made vnto them of the same, speciallie

<p>In the yeare following, which was in the yeare 1315, the princes of Ireland oppressed (as
<note place="marg"><date>1315.</date></note>
they tooke it) with long and insufferable tyrannie of the Englishmen, and trusting by support of
Scots to recouer their libertie, now after so notable an ouerthrow of the whole English puissance,
<note place="marg">The lords of Ireland require aid of king Robert.</note>
sent ambassadors vnto king Robert, requiring that it might please him to send his brother
Edward Bruse, to receiue the crowne and gouernement of their countrie of Ireland. This request being granted, Edward prepared to take that iournie in hand, and so with a small power
of Scotishmen transporting ouer into Ireland, and ioining with an armie of such as were readie
to assist him there, he tooke the towne of Vister, and siue a great number of Englishmen

which were found in the same. Then afterwards, by the generall consent of all the estates

of Ireland, Edward Bruse was proclamed king of that realme, and certeine of the Irish nobilitie sent ambassadors vnto the pope, to sue for a ratification of their act and proc&eacute;edings, for
the suertie and weale of their countrie, sith they were not able longer to susteine the gr&eacute;euous
yoke of the English thraldome. These ambassadors, through their earnest diligence, got such
fauor in their sute, that the pope sundrie times charged the Englishmen to auoid out of Ireland;
<note place="marg">The English men passe little on the popes commandements.</note>
howbeit, they s&eacute;emed to passe little of his commandements in that behalfe, for they dailie
sought how to make themselues strong in that part, least they should lose the possession of
that countrie, which their enimies were about to get foorth of their hands.</p>
<p>King Robert being informed how through the reenforcement of the English armie, being
dailie refreshed with new succors, his brother was like to run in danger to be cast away, he
left sir Iames Dowglasse gouernor in Scotland, with a competent number of men to defend

<note place="marg">King Robert passeth ouer into Ireland.</note>
the borders, and he himselfe with a great power of other souldiers and men of war went ouer
into Ireland, to support his brother: but suffering great distresse at his first comming thither,
for want of vittels &amp; other prouisions, he lost almost the one halfe of his folks through verie
famine &amp; hunger, &amp; the residue were constreined to eate horsses and other such lothsome
meats, therewith to susteine their languishing liues. At length being approched within a daies
iournie of his brother, in purpose to haue supported him with those people which he had left,
his brother not abiding his comming, fought vnwiselie with the Englishmen at a place called
Dundach, and receiuing the ouerthrow, was slaine himselfe with a great number of other. It
<note place="marg">Edward Bruse is slaine in Ireland.</note>

<note place="marg">S&eacute;e more of this matter in Ireland.</note>
is vncerteine whether he had anie knowledge of the comming of his brother king Robert, or
that through desire of fame he feared least if he staied till his brother came, a great part of
the praise (if they got the victorie) should remaine to him: and therefore he made such hast
to fight. But howsoeuer it was, thus he was slaine on the fourt&eacute;enth of October, in the
yeare 1317.</p>
<p>Edward king of England, hearing that king Robert was passed ouer into Ireland, thought
the time to serue well for his purpose, eftsoones to inuade Scotland: and herevpon comming with
a great power to the borders, he purposed to haue doone some great feat. But sir Iames Dewglas the gouernor, hauing likewise gathered an armie, gaue him battell, and put both him &amp; his
people to flight. In this battell were slaine thr&eacute;e notable capteins on the English side: as sir
Edmund Lilaw a Gascoigne capteine of Berwike, with sir Iames Neuill, and the third sir Iames
Dowglasse slue with his owne hands. King Edward perceiuing it was not like that he should
doo anie good at that time against the Scots by land, thought it best to assaile them by sea,
which way foorth the Englishmen commonlie were euer too good for the Scots. He rigged

<p>Duncane earle of Fife, hearing of these cruelties doone by the Englishmen, came foorth
with fiue hundred hardie souldiers, to defend the countrie from such inuasions: but when he
perceiued that the enimies were of greater number than he was able well to incounter,
hauing but an handfull of men in comparison to them, he gaue somewhat backe, and
in the meane time met with William Sinclare bishop of Dunkeld, hauing about thr&eacute;e score
armed men in his companie, who blaming the earle for his faintnesse of courage, caused him
to set forward againe towards the enimies, &amp; finding them busie in spoiling &amp; harrieng the
countrie, they gaue an onset vpon them so fiercelie, that there was slaine at the first incounter
to the number of fiue hundred of the Englishmen, and the residue chased to their botes lieng

during the siege, they had erected manie fortresses before the castell, to annoie such as were
within: of which forts they made one at Vpsitlington, and one in the church of Norham, the
castell whereof had beene twise teinted and in danger of losse, had not the lord Persie
and Neuill (being great succourers of the marches) rescued the same. For at one time the
vtter ward of Norham castell was taken in the time of this Grey on saint Katharins eeuen,
which the Scots kept not but thr&eacute;e daies, and their purpose in winning the same did vtterlie
faile them.)</p>

towne of all the goods found therein; but compounding with them that kept the church
against them for a thousand marks, they forbare to burne anie of the buildings. After they had
taried here thr&eacute;e daies, they departed thence, and went to Knaresburgh, which towne they
burnt, and beating the woods (into the which the people were withdrawne with their goods
and cattell) they got a great bootie, and returning homewards by Scipton in Crauen, they
first spoiled the towne, and after burnt it, and so marching thorough the countrie, came backe

<note place="marg">Berwike besieged.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Ri. Southwell.</emph></note>
so well defended, that he was constreined with small honor to returne home, and leaue it as he
found it. For in the meane time, while king Edward lay at the siege before Berwike, Thomas
Randall earle of Murrey, and the lord Iames Dowglasse assembled their forces togither; but
perceiuing themselues too weake to remooue the siege by force, they passed by, and entring
into England, wasted and spoiled all before them, k&eacute;eping on their way vnto Burrowbridge:
whereof when the citizens of Yorke were aduertised, with their capteins William Melton their
<note place="marg">William Melton archbishop of Yorke.</note>
archbishop, and the bishop of Elie, not making them of the countrie once priuie to their purpose, but hauing in their companie a great number of priests and men of religion, they gaue
battell to the Scots one day in the after noone, not farre from the towne of Mitton vpon Swale,
<note place="marg">The battell of Mitton vpon Swale.</note>
twelue miles distant from Yorke northwards.</p>
<p>But forsomuch as the most part of the Englishmen were not expert in the feates of warre,
and came not in anie orderlie arraie of battell, they were easilie vanquished &amp; put to flight by
<note place="marg">The English men discomfited.</note>
the Scots, who were readie to receiue them in good order, close togither in one entier squadrone, and after their accustomed maner, at their first ioining they gaue a great showt, wherewith the Englishmen out of hand began to giue backe: which when the Scots perceiued,
they got them to their horsses, and followed the chase most egerlie, beating downe and
sleaing the Englishmen, neither sparing religious person nor other, so that there died to the
number of foure thousand Englishmen that day, and amongst the rest was the maior of Yorke
<note place="marg">The maior of Yorke slaine.</note>
one. In the water of Swale (as was said) there were drowned to the number of a thousand.
To be short, if night had not come the sooner vpon, it was thought scarse there should anie
of the English part haue escaped.</p>
<p>When king Edward lieng as yet at the siege of Berwike, vnderstood what mischiefe the
Scots did within his realme, he raised his siege, in purpose to haue incountered with his enimies: but the Scots aduertised of his purpose, returned with all their prisoners and spoile
by Stanemoore, and so through Gilsland, and the west marches, withdrew home into their
countrie. About the feast of All saints, when the inhabitants of the north parts had got in
their haruest, so that their barnes were now stuffed with corne, of the which prouision they
were to liue all the y&eacute;ere after, the Scots vnder the conduct of the said two capteins, the earle
<note place="marg">The Scots inuade England.</note>
of Murrey, and the lord Dowglasse, entered into England, and burnt the countrie of Gilsland,
taking away both such people as they tooke prisoners, and also all the cattell which they might
meet with, and so kept vpon their iournie till they came to Burgh vnder Stanemoore, 
<note place="marg">Burgh vnder Stanemoore.</note>
destroieng all afore them, &amp; then returning through Westmerland, practised the like mischiefe
there, in burning vp houses and come in all places where they came, as they had doone before in Gilsland. And finallie passing through Cumberland with the like hauocke, at length
they drew home into their owne countrie, with no small number of prisoners, and plentie of
great riches which they had got in that iournie. [And the souldiers going backe againe

at Lieth to go vnto Edenburgh) was constreined to returne for lacke of vittels.]</p>

Robert hauing no trouble, neither within his realme nor without, caused a parlement to be

they held their lands. The lords after long aduisement taken herein, at length pulled out
their swoords all at once, declaring that they had none other euidence nor charter to shew for
the tenure of their lands. King Robert was somewhat amazed at this sight, and tooke no
small indignation therewith, but yet he dissembled for the time, and commended them for
their noble hearts and valiant stomachs: neuerthelesse, he purposed to be reuenged of their

proud presumptions, when more opportunitie of time serued thereto. Sundrie of the nobles
<note place="marg">Conspiracie of the lords against king Robert.</note>
perceiuing that the king bare an inward grudge towards them for this matter, deuised amongst
themselues how to deliuer him into king Edwards hands, so to auoid all danger that right
follow of his displeasure conceiued thus against them. For the accomplishment of this their
treasonable practise, they made a bond in writing, confirmed with their hands and seales betwixt them, &amp; minded to send the same into England vnto king Edward. But king Robert
hauing some inkeling of this their purpose, caused diligent watch to be laid by the way
for such as should passe into England from them with the said bond, insomuch that in
the end a palmer or pilgrime was apprehended which had the bond, and other writings
<note place="marg">A palmer taken with writings on him.</note>
inclosed within his pilgrims staffe.</p>
<p>King Robert vnderstanding by these writings all the manner of the treason, and what they
were that had consented to the same, hastilie sent for the whole number of them, as though
there had beene some matter in hand wherein he wished to haue their aduise. They were no
sooner come, but streightwaies calling them before him, he questioned with them whether they
knew their owne hands and seales, and immediatlie therewith shewed the writings, which
were found in the palmers staffe: and because they could not denie their owne act, they were
committed to ward within sundrie castels, till he had taken further aduise in the matter. 
<note place="marg">The lords that had conspired, are committed to ward.</note>
Incontinentlie after, he went to Berwike, and there arrested the capteine of the towne, named sir
William Soulis, and caused him to be conueied to Perth (committing the said William Souils
(as saith Io. Maior) with the countesse of Straherne, to perpetuall prison) where shorlie
after he called an assemblie of all the estates of the realme. This was called the blacke
<note place="marg">The black parlement.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1320.</date></note>
parlement, kept in the y&eacute;ere after the incarnation of our Sauiour 1320. In this parlement,
at the beginning thereof, was Dauid Abernethie, the sisters sonne of king Robert, accused as
partie to the treason aforesaid, though being laboured vnto by the rest of the conspirators to
ioine with them therein, he refused so to doo, but yet for that he did not vtter the thing, but
concealed it with them, he was condemned &amp; lost his head, the people sore lamenting his 
<note place="marg">Dauid Abernethie loseth his head.</note>
mishap, for the great valiancie which was knowne to be in him, hauing serued honorablie manie
yeeres before against the Saracens, and other miscreants in the parties of beyond the seas,
where he was called the flower of chiualrie.</p>
<p>In d&eacute;ed the king himselfe would gladlie haue saued his life, but for that he minded to doo
iustice on the residue, and finding no man to make sute for him, he permitted the execution
to proc&eacute;ed against him. On the morrow after, he caused all the residue of the traitors to be
<note place="marg">Among other were these, Gilbert de Malet, Iohn Cogi knights, and Richard Bron a notable warriour.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Iohn Maior.</emph></note>
brought foorth to iudgement, and sentence being giuen against them, he commanded without
delaie that they should be executed. Then came diuerse and sundrie persons in most humble
wise to make sute for pardon to the king for their friends and kinsmen: but he made them
plaine answer, that there was none to be found that would make intercession for the sauing
of his kinsmans life the day before, when he was led to execution, that had offended nothing
so grieuouslie, in comparison of them for whome they now made sute; and therfore he bad
them be contented, for they should assuredlie haue according to that which they had deserued.
And therewith were the officers commanded to make hast with the execution, which was
<note place="marg">Execution without respit.</note>
doone incontinentlie without anie further respit.</p>
<p>There were some that were accused to be partakers in this treason, but yet for that no euident proofes could be produced against them, they were dismissed, as Walter Maxwell, with
Walter Berclaie shiriffe of Aberdene, Patrike Graim, Hameline Neidrinton, and Eustace
Rathre, knights; besides eight others. But yet the countesse of Straherne &amp; William de
Soulis were condemned to perpetuall prison. The earle of Buchquhanes lands, who suffered
at that present, were diuided into two parts, the one being giuen to William Haie that was
made constable of the realme in place of Iohn Quincie, who likewise suffered at the same
time; and the other part was giuen vnto William Reth, togither with the office of the stewardship of the realme. About the same time the king of England by complaint made to the
pope, purchased that a legat was sent from the s&eacute;e apostolike into Scotland, to admonish king
<note place="marg">A legat sent from rome to the Scots.</note>
Robert to ceasse from further disquieting the realme of England, by such cruell inuasions, as

were surmised that he wrongfullie exercised against the same realme. But answer was made
<note place="marg">The answer made to the legat.</note>
h&eacute;erevnto by the king, and other the nobles of the realme of Scotland, that all the world might
well vnderstand that the whole occasion of all the trouble which had chanced betwixt
the two realmes of England and Scotland, did onelie proc&eacute;ed of the couetous desire in the
Englishmen, s&eacute;eking to conquer that realme without anie iust claime or title: and therefore
they thought it reason first to suppresse the loftie stomachs of the Englishmen; and then
if there were anie thing woorthie to be reformed on their behalfes, they would be contented to
stand vnto the order of the popes authoritie therein. Thus was the legat dispatched home,
without other effect of his errand [sauing (as saith Buchanan) he curssed and interdicted the
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
Scots and Scotland.]</p>
<p>Shortlie after, king Robert entered with an armie into England, and wasted the countrie

before him, till he came to the recrosse, which standeth vpon Stanemoore. Howbeit it should
s&eacute;eme by that which Richard Southwell writeth h&eacute;ereof, that king Robert was not present
himselfe in person in this iournie, but that he appointed the earle of Murrey to be his lieutenant,
who with an armie, after the feast of the Epiphanie entered into England, and comming to
Darington, staied there for a season, whilest the lord Iames Dowglasse, and the lord Steward
of Scotland went abroad to harrie and spoile the countrie on ech side, the one of them passing
foorth towards Hartilpoole and Cliueland, and the other towards Richmond. The 
<note place="marg">Richmondshire redeemed from spoile with a summe of monie.</note>
inhabitants of Richmondshire, hauing no capteine amongest them to defend their countrie from
that grieuous inuasion of the enimie, gaue a great summe of monie in like manner, as at other
times they had doone, to haue their countrie spared from fier and spoile.</p>
<p>The Scots taried at this time about 15 daies within England, and in the end returned without battell. For when the knights of the north countries repared vnto the duke of Lancaster
<note place="marg">The duke of Lancasters disloialtie.</note>
then lieng at Pomfret, and offered to go into the field with him against the Scots, he would
not once stirre his foot, by reason of the discord that was depending betwixt him and king
Edward: but howsoeuer the matter went, king Edward sore grieued in his mind with such
inuasion made by his enimies the Scots, he gaue order to leauie an armie of an hundred thousand men, what on horssebacke and on foot (as the report went) appointing them to be readie to enter into Scotland at Lammias next: whereof king Robert being aduertised, ment to
<note place="marg">King Robert inuadeth England.</note>
preuent him, and thervpon in the octaues of the Natiuitie of saint Iohn Baptist, he entered
into England with an armie n&eacute;ere to Carleill, and burnt a manor place that sometime belonged
to him at Rosse, and Allerdale, and spoiled the monasterie of Holme, notwithstanding his
<note place="marg">The abbeie of Holme burnt.</note>
fathers corps was there interred.</p>
<p>From thence he marched forward, destroieng and spoiling the countrie of Copland, and so
k&eacute;eping vpon his iournie, passed Doden sands, towards the abbeie of Fourneis: but the
<note place="marg">Fourneis abbeie.</note>
abbat m&eacute;eting him on the waie, red&eacute;emed his lands from spoile, and brought king Robert to
his house, and made to him great ch&eacute;ere: but yet the Scots could not hold their hands from
burning and spoiling diuerse places; and marching forward vnto Cartmele beyond Leuin
<note place="marg">Leuin sands.</note>
sands, burnt and spoiled all the countrie about, except a priorie of blacke canons which stood
there. Passing from thence they came to Lancaster, which towne they also burnt, saue onelie
<note place="marg">The towne of Lancaster burnt.</note>
the priorie of blacke moonks, and a house of preaching friers. H&eacute;ere came to them the earle
of Murrey, and the lord Iames Dowglasse with an other armie, wherevpon marching further
southwards, they came to Preston in Anderneis, and burnt that towne also, the house of friers
<note place="marg">Preston in Anderneis burnt.</note>
minors onelie excepted.</p>
<p>And thus being foure score miles within England from their owne borders, they returned
homewards with all their prisoners, cattell, and other boodes which they had got in that iournie,
comming to Carleill on the &eacute;eue of saint Margaret, and lodging about that towne the space of
fiue daies, they wasted and destroied the come, &amp; all other things that came within their reach.
Which doone, on saint Iames euen they entred into Scotland againe, hauing b&eacute;ene within
England at this time thr&eacute;e weekes and thr&eacute;e daies. Immediatlie heerevpon, to wit, about

he came to Edenburgh, through want of vittels and other necessarie prouision, he was constreined to returne home within the space of 15 daies. For king Robert aduertised of his
comming, had caused all the come and cattell in the countrie to be conueied out of the waie
into certeine forts, wherevnto the Englishmen might not come to get it into their hands, &amp; so
to relieue themselues therewith. But in their returning homeward, somewhat to reuenge their
displeasures, they spoiled and burnt the abbeies of Melrose, and Driburgh, with diuerse other

<p>In reuenge heereof, king Robert shortlie after entred with a puissant armie into England
spoiling &amp; wasting the countrie, till he came almost to Yorke. At length, hearing that king
Edward was comming towards him with an armie, he chose a plot of round betwixt the abbeie of Biland and saint Sauiour, there to abide battell; which king Edward refused not to
giue, though in the end he was put to flight with his whole power, and chased with great
slaughter both of Englishmen and Normans, which were there in his aid. Diuerse also of
the nobilitie were taken prisoners, as Iohn de Britaine earle of Richmond, and Henrie Sowlie,
with others. This battell was fought in the y&eacute;ere of our Sauiour 1323, 15 daies after the feast
of saint Michaell the archangell. King Edward lieng the same time at the abbeie of Riuale,
aduertised of this ouerthrow, fled and got him into Yorke, leauing his plate and much other
stuffe behind him for want of cariage in that his sudden departure, which the Scots comming
thither found, and tooke awaie with them. And from thence they passed foorth into 
<note place="marg">Yorkeswold wasted by Scots.</note>
Yorkeswold, spoiling and wasting the countriemen vnto Beuerleie, which towne for a summe of
monie they were contented to spare, and so then they returned homewards, entering againe
into Scotland on All soules day, which is the second of Nouember, after they had remained
within England at that time the space of a moneth and foure daies.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, king Robert sent an ambassador to the French king [to pacifie him offended

Scotland and France, which was accomplished with this new condition added to the former
articles, that if it chanced that succession failed touching the inheritance of the crowne of
either realme, so that a doubt should rise, who ought by right to inioy the same, the claime
and title thereof should be tried and decided by the nobles of both the realmes; and further,
that they should not onelie remooue and exclude all such as went about wrongfullie to vsurpe
the crowne, but also to defend and mainteine the true inheritor to the vttermost of their powers.
In confirmation of this couenant, both the kings receiued the sacrament. And for further ratifieng of it, they made a prouiso, that whereas (then) they had the popes consent h&eacute;ereto, 
<note place="marg">A prouiso.</note>
neither he, nor anie of his successors h&eacute;ereafter should dispense with them for the breaking

<note place="marg"><emph>Ri. Southwell.</emph></note>
commissioners from the two kings of England and Scotland, vnto Newcastell, there to treate of
some agr&eacute;ement of peace. For the king of England came Amerie de Valence earle of Penbroke, the lord Hugh Spenser the yoonger, and foure other persons sufficientlie authorised.
And for the king of Scots came the bishop of saint Andrewes, Thomas Randall earle of Murrey, and foure other persons likewise of good calling. After much talke, in the end they
agr&eacute;ed vpon a truce to indure for 13 y&eacute;eres, which was proclamed in both realmes about the

descended of noble linage, called Hamton, chanced for speaking certeine woords in commendation of king Robert, to fall at variance with one of king Edwards priuie chamber,
named Iohn Spenser; insomuch that fighting togither about the same woords, Hammons
hap was to slea this Spenser, &amp; therevpon knowing there was no waie but death, if he
should hap to be caught, he fled with all speed into Scotland, where he was receiued of
the king in most friendlie wise, and had giuen to him for the maintenance of his estate like a
gentleman, the lands of Cadzow [which (as saith Buchanan) he called by the name of Hamilton.]</p>

kept vntill the comming of qu&eacute;ene Isabell against hir husband Edward the second, at what
time he deliuered the same into the hands of the said queene, and returned into Scotland.]</p>
<p>In the meane time, Edward king of England being ruled altogither by two of the Spensers,
as Hugh the father and Hugh the sonne, ran so farre into the hatred of his people, as
well the nobles as commons, that in the end he was deposed of all kinglie authoritie,

in the y&eacute;ere 1326. In the night of the same day in which he receiued the crowne, the Scots
ment to haue stolne the castell of Norham by scaling, and they went so cunninglie about
their purpose, that they were to the number of 16 of them got aloft on the wals: but the
capteine of this castle Robert Maners being warned aforehand of their comming by one of
his souldiers that was a Scotishman borne, suddenlie assailed them, slue nine or ten of
them, and tooke fiue prisoners aliue, but sore wounded, so as this misfortune falling to them
in the beginning of king Edward the third his reigne, might haue beene a forwarning of
their losses to follow in the daies of his gouernement.</p>
<p>Whilest these things were a dooing in England, king Robert though he might s&eacute;eme to
haue title iust inough to the crowne of Scotland, which he had possessed now not onliy by
rightfull conquest but also by lawfull interest of inheritance for a certeine number of y&eacute;eres,
by consent of all the estates of the realme; yet to the end to put awaie all doubts, and to
conclude the succession of the Balioll from all claime, which heereafter they might pretend
to the crowne of Scotland, he sent sir Iames Dowglasse into France vnto the lord Iohn
<note place="marg">Iames Dowglasse sent into France to the Balioll.</note>

he might s&eacute;ems to had to the crowne of Scotland, as well for himselfe as his heires &amp;
successors for euer, to king Robert le Bruse, and his heires. In consideration of which resignation, he offered faire lands and rents to him to be appointed foorth in Scotland.</p>
<p>The Balioll being now sore worne with age, and thereto blind of bodilie sight, lightlie
consented vnto this motion, considering (as he said) he tooke it to be the ordinance of
almightie God, that king Robert should inioy the gouernement of the Scotish kingdome, as
most woorthie and able thereto, hauing deliuered the same, and defended it most valiantlie
from the hands of most cruell enimies. He called therefore his friends and kinsmen togither, in the presence of whome he wholie resigned vnto king Robert and his heires, all

the returne of sir Iames Dowglasse foorth of France, with so good expedition and dispatch
of that businesse wherabout he was sent, king Robert verie ioifull thereof, assembled a

crowne. All the lords at the same time were sworne to mainteine this ordinance.</p>
<p>In the meane while, king Edward the third sent vnto king Robert for peace, but forsomuch
as it was perceiued to be but a coloured pretense, no conclusion thereof insued, but preparation

things touching the common-wealth, and other the affaires of the realme vnto Thomas Randall, earle of Murrey, and to the lord Iames Dowglasse, two capteins, for their high prowesse
and noble valiancie in those daies greatlie renowmed. These two hardie chiefteins assembling an armie of twentie thousand men, or (as some writers haue) 25 thousand, entered
with the same into Northumberland, wasting &amp; spoiling the countrie on ech side. [And
incountring with an assemblie of the English at Darlington, there siue manie of them, and
put the rest to flight.] Against whome came king Edward with an armie of an hundred
thousand men: of the which number there were (as Froissard saith) eight thousand horssemen, and 24 thousand archers. At their comming into Northumberland, they might well
perceiue by the smoke of the fiers, which the Scots made in burning of villages, houses,
and townes, where the enimies were: but yet because they taried not long in a place, but
passed on without soiorning here or there, the Englishmen might not come n&eacute;ere to fight
with them.</p>
<p>King Edward therefore was counselled to draw towards Scotland, that lieng betwixt them
and home, he might haue them at some aduantage as they should returne, which was
thought should be shortlie, as well for lacke of vittels, as also to defend their owne borders,
when they heard once that the English armie drew that waies foorth. But comming to
the riuer of Tine, through abundance of raine (latelie fallen) the streame was so risen, that
neither horase nor man might passe, so that the armie was constreined to incampe there
for the space of thr&eacute;e daies, in great scarsitie of vittels, till they were faine to send vnto
Newcastell (which was distant from thence 26 miles) and to Carleill (which was about
22. miles thence) for prouision, which was sent them from those places in great plentie,
In the meane time were thus certeine light horssemen sent abroad into the countrie, to
vnderstand where the Scots were, and to view their dooings. [Vpon proclamation before
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
made by the king (that who so could bring him word where the Scots were harbored, should
haue a hundred pounds of y&eacute;erelie reuenues in recompense for the same; Thomas Rokesbeie after diligent search, brought word to the king thereof:] for those which were sent,
finding where the Scots were incamped, vpon the top of a mounteine, not past sixe miles
<note place="marg">The Scots are incamped on a hill.</note>
from the English campe, returned backe to king Edward, and declared what they had s&eacute;ene
and learned of the enimies dooings.</p>
<p>King Edward right ioifull of the news, causeth his armie to be diuided into thr&eacute;e battels,
and foorthwith marcheth on towards the place where his enimies laie. And comming about
noone daies within sight of the Scots, he perceiued at length that the place which they kept
was so strong, what with the heigth of the ground, &amp; thereto defended on the one side
with the course of a riuer, that by no means they might be assailed without great and manifest danger. The Englishmen in the end thought it best to choose foorth a place to 
<note place="marg">The Englishmen sent to the Scots.</note>
incampe in for that night, and so doing, sent an herald at armes vnto the Scots, requiring
them to come downe vnto some euen ground where battell might be giuen; but the Scots
refused so to doo, alledging that sith the Englishmen were three to one in number, it was
<note place="marg">The answer of the Scots.</note>
no reason to will them to forsake their ground of aduantage which they had taken and
chosen for their owne defense.</p>
<p>Thus were they incamped n&eacute;ere togither either in sight of other for the space of thr&eacute;e
nights, euerie day shewing themselues in order of battell, without breaking their arraie,
except certeine of the horssemen, which on either part now and then came foorth and
fell in skirmish, so that sometimes a man might haue seene good emptieng of saddles
betwixt them. On the fourth day in the morning, when the Englishmen beheld the hill
<note place="marg">The Scots dislodge.</note>
where the Scots had lien the night before, they perceiued how they were gone, and therevpon sending foorth light horssemen to trie out which way they had taken, word was
brought how they were but remoued to an other hill a little off, lieng fast by the same riuer,
and there lay incamped more stronglie than before. Incontinentlie herevpon, king Edward

with their power were now lodged. At length, after that both the armies had lien thus a
good space the one ouer against the other, Iames Dowglasse tooke aduise with himselfe to
exploit a right hardie enterprise.</p>
<p>He chose foorth two hundred of perfect good horssemen, mounted vpon verie swift and
readie geldings, with the which in the night season he passed sillie by the English watch,
<note place="marg">An enterprise exploited by sir Iames Dowglasse.</note>
that he was not once descried by amie of them, till he was entered into their campe, where,
by the noise of the moouing of the horsse f&eacute;et, some chanced to awake that lay asl&eacute;epe
But yet yer the alarme were raised to anie purpose, the Scots thus led by Dowglas had
persed through, euen vnto the kings tent, and cut two cords of the same in sunder, so
that the king was in no small danger to haue beene slaine, had not the Scots withdrawen the
sooner for doubt of being inclosed with their enimies as now raised on each side to come
to his succors, but Dowglasse yet returned in safetie with his number backe againe to the
Scotish campe, hauing slaine (as some books report) thr&eacute;e hundred Englishmen at this
brunt. The Englishmen warned hereby, tooke better heed after to their watch.</p>
<p>These armies lay thus one against an other for the space of eight&eacute;ene daies, till at length
<note place="marg">The Scots secretlie returne home to their countrie.</note>
the Scots priuilie in the night conueied themselues away, and returned home in most sp&eacute;edie
wise, supposing they had doone sufficientlie inough for that time. It chanced that in the
euening, before the Scots went thus their waies, there was a Scot taken by the English
watch, who being brought before the king, confessed that there was commandement giuen
through the Scotish campe, that euerie man should be readie with his armor and weapon
to follow the standard of Dowglasse at a certeine houre the same night, but whither they
intended to go, it was vnknowne, saue onelie amongest the capteins. Herevpon the English
doubting least the Scots minded to giue them a camisado that night, placed themselues in
order of battell, and so stood till the next morning readie to haue receiued them, if they
had come. The Scots also made great fires within their campe, that they might s&eacute;e about
them. In the breake of the day, there were two Scotish trumpeters taken by the English scouts,
the which being brought before the king, declared that the Scotish armie was broken vp
and returned, and further shewed how they were appointed thus to declare vnto him, hauing
suffered themselues to be taken for the same intent. As soone as the Englishmen were
aduertised that the Scots were thus departed, they hasted to the place where they had lien
incamped, in hope to haue found some riches, which for hast they had left behind them:
but at their comming thither, they found nothing, but 20000 paires of hieland shooes,
which are made of the gr&eacute;ene hides of beasts vntanned. Also they found three hundred
hides of sauage beasts set vpon stakes in stead of caldrons, therein to seeth their meat.
Moreouer, they had left behind them fiue hundred dead carcasses of beasts &amp; sh&eacute;epe, which
for that they could not driue them away, they killed, to the end the Englishmen should
haue no game by them. There were likewise found fiue Englishmen with their legs
broken, &amp; bound naked vnto tr&eacute;es, which were quicklie loosed and committed to the cure
of surgians. The enimies being thus departed, king Edward by aduise of his councell
<note place="marg">King Edward breaketh vp his campe.</note>
brake vp his campe, and returned to London, supposing it but lost labour to trauell his
people anie further at that time.</p>
<p>In this yeare died Walter Steward, father to Robert Steward, that was after king of

Iohn Clapauen, and Malisius de Dunbar, with diuerse other of the Scotish nobilitie. In

for the conclusion of a peace, which was accorded in this wise: that K. Edward should renounce all his right &amp; claime which he had or might haue to the crowne of Scotland,
in declaring it fr&eacute;e as it was in time of king Alexander the third, vnder these conditions,
that Northumberland should be admitted for the marches of Scotland on the east part,

to king Edward thirtie thousand marks sterling. And for the more suertie and ratification
of this finall agr&eacute;ement and peace betwixt the two nations, it was concluded that lane the
sister of king Edward should be coupled in mariage with Dauid Bruse the prince of Scotland.</p>
<p>All which articles were put in writing, wherevnto all the seals of the great lords within
both the realms were set in most substantiall wise. The solemnization of the mariage
before remembred was kept at Berwike within a while after, on the eight&eacute;enth day of Iulie,
in the presence of a great number of the nobilitie, both of England and Scotland. King
Robert liued not past tweiue moneths after this mariage, departing out of this life at Caroros
the seuenth day of Iulie, in the yeare of our Lord 1329. In the latter end of his daies,
he was gr&eacute;euouslie vexed with a leprosie, which thus finallie made an end of him, in the
twentie fourth yeare of his reigne, being one of the most valiant princes knowen in anie part
<note place="marg">King Robert tasted both prosperous and aduerse fortune.</note>
of the whole world in those his daies, hauing felt in his time the force of either fortune: for in
the beginning of his reigne, such storms of aduersitie surrounded him on each side, that
if his constant manhood had not b&eacute;ene the greater, it might haue brought him in despaire
of all recouerie: for beside sundrie discomfitures, which he receiued at the hands of the
enimies, with losse of all his brethren (his brother Edward onlie excepted) the most part
of all the lords of Scotland were against him, and aided his aduersaries to the vitermost of
his* power: yet he nothing discouraged herewith, ceassed not to imploy all industrious
<note place="marg">[* <emph>Sic.</emph>]</note>
means to deliuer his countrie from the yoke of seruile bondage (which he bel&eacute;eued would
succ&eacute;ed by the gouernment of the English kings) till at length (as it were in despite of all
former chances) he atteined the effect of his whole indeuors, so much the more to his
praise, as he had found the hinderance and difficultie great in bringing the same fullie to
passe.</p>
<p>His fame therefore did spread hugelie, not onelie amongst his owne people, but also
<note place="marg">The fame of king Robert.</note>
amongst strangers, insomuch that his due praise was not wanting, no not euen amongst
and in the midst of his verie enimies. For (as it is said) on a time it chanced that king

<note place="marg">A question proponed to an English herald by king Edward the third.</note>
Edward the third, sitting at a banket amongst his nobles, fell in talke with them of warlike
enterprises, and of such notable capteins as had excelled in knowledge in that behalfe. At
length, after much reasoning to and fro, he proponed this question to the king of heralds,
that as then stood by, commanding him to declare which were the thr&eacute;e most worthie &amp;
valiant capteins that he had knowne in all his daies. The herald aduising with himselfe of
this matter, staied a space, in which meane while all the companie were quiet, longing to
heare his answere therein, both for that they knew his skill was such as was able best to
giue sentence in such a matter; and againe, for that manie of them thought h&eacute;e would
haue numbred some of those that were there present amongst those three. But the herald
did not onelie know all the noble men within the realme of England, but also all such
strangers as had in anie wise excelled in Martiall prowesse, hauing all their acts and valiant
dooings in fresh memorie, and therevpon boldlie vttered his mind as followeth.</p>
<p>"The first, most woorthie and valiant chiefteine (said he) that hath liued in these our
<note place="marg">The heralds answer to the question.</note>
daies, was Henrie the emperour: for he subdued thr&eacute;e kings and thr&eacute;e realmes, and mainteined his imperiall estate and prosperous felicitie to his liues end. The second, was sir
Giles of Argentine, who in thr&eacute;e sundrie battels against the Saracens get the victorie, &amp; slue
two of their principall capteins with his owne hands. The third (if vnder your graces correction I may praise the enimie) I must iudge to be Robert Bruse king of Scotland."
whom the herald had no sooner named, but all those that were present, with scornfull
<note place="marg">The herald is scorned.</note>
laughter began to ieast at the heralds presumption, for that he durst so maiapertlie in the
kings presence honor the enimie with so high praise. At length, at the heralds request,
the king commanded them to be still. The herald then began againe thus: "I bes&eacute;ech
<note place="marg">The heralds excuse.</note>
our highnesse (said he) if I haue ought offended, to take my woords in good part: for

<pb n="361"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"361"</fw>-->

I haue beene euer of this opinion, that the truth should in euerie case be vttered, receiued,
<note place="marg">The heralds opinion.</note>
and allowed in your presence; namelie, where your highnesse commandeth anie man to
declare the same. This one thing therefore I shall desire you to consider, that if a man
must n&eacute;eds be vanquished, it is lesse dishonor to be vanquished of him that is knowne for
a right valiant personage, than of him that is but a coward. Moreouer, to shew plainelie
vnto your grace, how much I est&eacute;eme the valiancie of king Robert (whome I perceiue
some here may not abide to haue numbred with the two former most valiant capteins) if
truth might appeare, I durst be bold to preferre him with good cause before them both:
for the valiant acts atchiued by Henrie the emperour may be ascribed rather to the 
<note place="marg">The opinion of the herald concerning king Roberts valiancie.</note>
wisedome of his councellors, than to his owne valiantnesse and prudence: but contrarilie, king
Robert being confined out of his countrie, and destitute of friends and all conuenient aid,
recouered the realme of Scotland, by his singular manhood, out of the hands of your
noble father, and established it with such tranquillitie, that he appeared more terrible to
his enimies of England, than euer they had b&eacute;ene afore to his subiects of Scotland."
&para; These or the like words vttered by the herald, were well allowed of the king, and
stopped the mouths of them that tooke the matter so strangelie at the first.</p>
<p>But now to returne to the purpose. King Robert a little before the time of his death,
called togither into the chamber where he laie, the chiefest p&eacute;eres of his realme, and there
in presence of them all, committed vnto them the gouernment of his sonne Dauid, a child
as then not past seuen y&eacute;eres of age. He also aduised them of sundrie things touching the
rule of the realme after his decease, which he perceiued was at hand. And first he counselled them, that in no wise they should at anie time make an absolute lord ouer the Iles,
<note place="marg">The aduise giuen by king Robert vnto his nobles before his deceasse.</note>
bicause the people of the same are of nature vnstedfast, and soone seduced and brought to
mooue rebellion against the king, into the which being once fallen, they are not easilie
reduced to their due obedience againe, by reason their countries are of such strength, that
they cannot be approched but by sea, as inuironed with the same. Secondarilie, he aduised
them neuer to appoint anie set battell with the Englishmen, nor to ieopard the realme vpon
the chance of one field: but rather to resist and k&eacute;epe them off from indamaging their
countrie, by often skirmishing, &amp; cutting them off at streicts &amp; places of aduantage, to the
intent that if the Scots be discomfited, they may haue some power yet reserued to make
new resistance. Thirdlie, he forbad them in anie wise to make any long peace with England; for naturallie men wax dull and slouthfull by long rest and quietnes, so that after
long peace, through lacke of vse and exercise of armes, men are not able to susteine anie
great paines or trauell.</p>
<p>Moreouer, he alledged, how the Englishmen would continue in peace no longer than
there wanted oportunitie and conuenient occasion for them to attempt the warres: and
therefore he iudged it best, that the Scots should neuer conclude anie perpetuall peace with
them, nor take anie truce longer than for thr&eacute;e or foure y&eacute;eres at the most. He willed
them further, to consider one thing, that when their appeared least occasion of warres with
England, then they ought to be most circumspect, least peraduenture their enimies should
come at vnwares, and find them vnprouided for timelie resistance. Herevnto he desired them,
<note place="marg">His desire to haue his heart borne to the holy sepulchre.</note>
that after his deceasse, they would choose some one of the most worthie capteins within the
whole realme, to beare his heart vnto lerusalem, and there to s&eacute;e it buried within the
temple, before the holie sepulchre of our Lord. For if he had not beene for a long space
hindered by vrgent businesse of warres at home, and lastlie preuented by death, he had
vowed to haue passed with an armie into the holie land, in defense of the christian faith,
against the Turkes and Saracens.</p>
<p>Herevpon when he was dead, the lords by one assent, appointed sir Iames Dowglasse to
<note place="marg">The cause why the Dowglasses beare the bloudie heart.</note>
take this enterprise in hand, who willinglie obeied their order, as he that had euer during the
life of king Robert, serued most faithfullie the bodie wherein the same heart was inclosed,

few words) to be: that he was euerie way a most woorthie person, and that there were
few to be found (from the former heroicall daies) equall vnto him in all kinds of vertue.
For as he was in battell most valiant, so was he in peace most temperate &amp; iust. And
<note place="marg">There is no bodie but hath his shadow, no rose but hath his pricke.</note>
though his vndiuided good successe and perpetuall course of victories (after that fortune was
once satisfied or rather weried with his misfortunes) were verie great, yet he s&eacute;emeth to
Buchanan to be farre more woonde; full in his aduerse fortune: whose valure of mind was
such, that it could not be broken (no not so much as weakened) by so manie euils as happened vnto him at one time: whose singular constancie appeared by the captiuitie of his
wife, and the death of his valiant brethren. And besides that, his friends were at one
time vexed with all kind of calamities, and they which escaped death, were banished with
the losse of their substance: he himselfe was not onelie spoiled of all his patrimonie,
but of the kingdome also, by the mightiest king of that age Edward the first, king of
England, a man most readie in counsell, and of dispatch of his affaires as well in warre
as peace. Yea, so farre was this Bruse oppressed at one time with all these kinds of
euils, that he was driuen into extreame pouertie. In all which misfortunes he neuer
<note place="marg">Hyperbolicall commendations.</note>
doubted of the recouerie of the kingdome, neither did or said anie thing vnbeseeming the
noble mind of a king, for he offered no violent hands to himselfe, as did the late Cato and
Marcus Brutus, neither with Marius did he pursue his enimies with continuall hatred. For
when he had recouered his former estate, he so liued with them that most occasioned his
labour and trouble, that he rather remembred himselfe to be a king ouer them, and not an
enimie vnto them. To conclude, he did not so forsake himselfe towards his end (when
a grieuous disease added troubles to age) but that he confirmed and established the present
estate of the kingdome, and prouided for the quiet of posteritie, whereby his subiects did not
so much lament his death, as that they were depriued of so iust a king and godlie father.)</p>
<p>Sir Iames Dowglasse then chosen as most worthie to passe with king Roberts heart vnto
the holie land, closed the same in a case of gold, imbalmed with sweet spices, &amp; right pretious ointments. And herewith hauing in his companie a number of nobles, and gentlemen,
amongst whom sir William Sinclare and sir Robert Logan were chiefe, he passed foorth
till he came to the citie of Ierusalem, where he buried the heart aforesaid, with all reuerence
and solemnitie that he might deuise. This doone, he resorted with such number as he had
<note place="marg">The valiancie of Iames Dowglasse shewd against the Turkes.</note>
brought thither with him, vnto such other christian princes as at the same time were
gathered with great puissance, from sundrie parts of christendome to war with the Turks,
and there in companie with them, he did so noble seruice against the common enimies of
our religion, that by his often victories he wan great honor to the christian name. At
length, hauing accomplished his charge in those parties, with no lesse fame and glorie than
princelie magnificence, he tooke the seas to haue returned home into Scotland: but
<note place="marg">Iames Dowglas commeth on land in Spaine.</note>
by force of contrarie winds he was driuen on the coast of Spaine, landing there vpon the
borders of Granado, where at the same time he found the king of Aragon, readie to make
warres against the Saracens that inhabited in those parties.</p>
<p>The Dowglasse, to make his manhood and prowesse the more knowne in all parts where
he came, offered the king of Aragon to serue vnder him in those warres against the infidels,
and so fought at sundrie times in his support against the enimies, with prosperous successe,
till at length hauing too much confidence in fortunes fauour (which hath brought so
manie noble men to their deaths) h&eacute;e waxed negligent, and tooke small regard of dangers
that might insue, so that in the end he was inclosed by an ambush laid for him by the
enimies, and there slaine amongst them, with all such as he had about him. This was the

had gotten the victorie 57 sundrie times in fight against the Englishmen, and 13 times
against the Turkes, as it is written at length (saith Bellenden) in Scotichronicon. He
might haue beene right necessarie for the defense of Scotland, if his chance had b&eacute;ene to
haue returned home in safetie. He ended his life in maner (as is before mentioned) on the

During the time of his minoritie, earle Thomas Randall was ordeined gouernor of the realme,
who for the space of foure y&eacute;eres in the latter end of K. Roberts reigne, had the whole administration of things committed to his charge by the same king, for that by reason of sicknesse
he was not able to attend the same himselfe. This earle Thomas then being elected gouernor
by the generall consent of all the nobles of the realme, considered with himselfe, how necessarie it was for the people to continue in peace, till they had somewhat recouered their hinderance &amp; losses chanced to them by the former wars. He addressed therefore certeine 
<note place="marg">Ambassadors sent into England.</note>
ambassadors immediatlie after the death of king Robert, vnto the king of England, to require a new
confirmation of the peace betwixt both the realmes for a season. These ambassadours found

to be restored againe, or else to paie for it on his owne pursse. Finallie, such punishment was
<note place="marg">Punishment of th&eacute;eues.</note>
exercised against th&eacute;eues in all places, that both theft and pilfering were quite suppressed, and
the realme brought to more tranquillitie than euer it was in anie kings daies before.
Manie insolent and misruled persons were tamed by his seuere clastisement and iustice.
Also that vertue might b&eacute;e cherished within the realme, he commanded that no vagabund
<note place="marg">A laudable ordinance against vagarant persons.</note>
or idle person should be receiued into anie towne or place, except they had some craft or
science wherewith to get their liuings. By this meanes he purged the realme of Scotland of
manie idle &amp; slouthfull roges and vagabunds.</p>
<p>It is said, that during the time whilest such streict punishment was exercised against offendors, by the ministers of the lawes thereto by him authorised and assigned: it fortuned that a
earle of the countrie, bicause he durst not steale other mens goods, stole his owne plow irons,
that he might haue the value of them recompensed to him by the shiriffe: neuerthelesse, such
earnest diligence was vsed in the search and triall, who had the plow irons, that finallie the
truth came to light, wherevpon for his craftie falsehood the partie giltie was hanged, as he
<note place="marg">Vpright iustice.</note>
had well deserued. The gouernor himselfe, for that he saw how hard it was to reduce them
that had b&eacute;ene brought vp in slouthfull loitering, vnto honest exercise, held euer about him a
gard of warlike persons, that h&eacute;e might the more easilie oppresse all stubborne offendors,
which would not submit themselues to his commandements. Those that appeared before

<p>Others that refused to obeie, were pursued with his gard, and hanged euer as they were

<note place="marg">K. Edward enuieth the felicitie of the Scots.</note>
no rebellion was heard of within the realme of Scotland manie yeres after, so that such
tranquilitie folowed, that not onelie theeues and loitering lubbers were daunted, but the
realme also aduanced in wealth and riches, to the great terror of all the foes and enimies
thereof. King Edward aduertised of this great felicitie chanced to the Scots by this meanes,
began to enuie the same, and imagined with himselfe, that if earle Thomas, the author
of the same felicitie were dispatched out of the way, it should not onelie impeach the proc&eacute;eding of so great wealth to the Scots, but also make for the suertie of the realme of England: for the singular manhood and high prowesse of this earle was by him and other his nobles sore suspected.</p>
<p>He thought good therefore to attempt the thing by sleight, which might not be doone by
<note place="marg">K. Edwards purpose to destroie earle Thomas (as the Scots doo write.) But this is a kind of practise amongst men to forge slanderous reports to bring princes in contempt.</note>
force, that afterwards the realme of Scotland might be the more inf&eacute;ebled, and as it were made
open to receiue displeasure at his hands. For king Dauid was yoong, and manie of his nobles
bare small good will either towards him, or his house, for the slaughter of their fathers and
friends in the blacke parlement. Herevpon he deuised, which way he might best destroie
earle Thomas, the onlie confounder of all his imagined hope, as to atchiue anie luckie enterprise against the Scots. At length he deuised to dispatch him by poison: and after he had
long debated by whome he might worke that feat: finallie he found none so fit for his purpose,
as a moonke of the order and facultie of those, that wandering from place to place, can with
dissembling visage say that thing with mouth, which they neuer thought in heart: for oftentimes men of that order, put no difference betwixt shame and honestie, cloking their execrable
wickednesse vnder the feined shadow of their hypocriricall cowles.</p>
<p>This moonke, fullie instructed in that wherabout he was sent, came into Scotland, and
<note place="marg">A moonke sent into Scotl&amacr;d to poison the gouernor.</note>

<note place="marg">The fittest instrument to bring such a thing to passe.</note>
feining himselfe to be a physician, got credit within a while amongst the people, to be a man
of most excellent knowledge, for he had a companion with him, that being made priuie to the
matter, set foorth his cunning and practise to the vttermost, declaring what notable and most
desperat cures he had taken in hand, and made the patients perfectlie whole of the same, where
all other had quite giuen them ouer: namelie he bruted it abroad, that for healing of the stone
and grauell, his like was not to be found in all christendome, as euidentlie had appeared by
cures which he had shewed vpon sundrie noble men, both in England and France. This
he spake, for that it was knowne, how the lord gouernor was sore vexed with that disease,
hoping by this meanes to haue him in cure, that he might thereby the more easilie worke his
diuelish enterprise.</p>
<p>And euen according to his desire it came to passe: for being taken for such a man as he
was named to be, he was sent for to the gouernour, and comming before him, he handeled the
matter so with woords, that the gouernour was contented he should take him in hand, which he
did with such wicked intention, that persuading him to keepe such diet as he prescribed, and
h&eacute;erewith to take such sirrups &amp; other things as he would giue him, at length he most 
<note place="marg">The gouernor is poisoned.</note>
traitorouslie poisoned him in deed. The venem was of such mixture, as would not slea him out of
hand, but by little and little waste his entrails, that the moonke might haue leasure to escape
home into England, yer it were perceiued what he had doone. He therefore after he had mimistred his wicked poison, found meanes to conueie himselfe out of the waie, and returned
<note place="marg">The moonke fl&eacute;eth.</note>
most sp&eacute;edilie into England, informing king Edward how he had delt. The gouernor f&eacute;eling
himselfe tormented dailie woorse and woorse in his stomach and wombe, and hearing that the
moonke was gone, and minded not to returne to him againe, he began to doubt the matter,
and shortlie after learned by physicians that he was poisoned, and that the venem had taken
such hold within his bowels, that it was not possible to remooue it.</p>

<p>In the meane time was king Edward come with an armie to the borders, purposing to 
<note place="marg">K. Edward his purpose to inuade Scotland.</note>
inuade Scotland, for that he thought how the gouernour was either dead, or at the verie point of
death, and therefore he was in hope, that comming in time of the trouble vpon his death
into Scotland, he should fina occasion to atchiue some enterprise, highlie to his aduantage.
But the gouernour aduertised heereof, raised a power, and though he were not able either to

<note place="marg">An herald sent to the gouernour.</note>
ride or go, yet he caused himselfe to be caried foorth in an horsselitter. King Edward hearing
that the gouernour was comming towards him with an armie, &amp; that himselfe in person quite
contrarie to his expectation, he sent an herald vnto him for meane of communication of some
peace, as was outwardlie pretended, though nothing else was ment but that he should espie
how all things in the Scotish campe stood. The gouernour hearing of this heralds comming,
arraied himselfe in his best apparell, that it might app&eacute;ere he was rather recouered of his infirmitie, than otherwise weake and f&eacute;eble thorough his disease, and then causing the herald to be
brought before him, where he was set in a chaire, to heare what his message was, which consisting in certeine demands not greatlie agreeable to reason, the gouernour with bold countenance answered, that he trusted within short time to make it knowne, what right the 
<note place="marg">The gouernours answer to the herald.</note>
Englishmen had to mooue such vnreasonable requests, and thus dispatching the herald, he
gaue him all such gorgeous and rich apparell as he ware at the same time when he thus talked with him.</p>
<p>King Edward at the returne of the herald, not perceiuing otherwise by his report, but that
the gouernor was in health, he returned immediatlie with his armie into England, and licencing
euerie man to depart to his home, laid hands on the moonke, and as one that had dissembled
<note place="marg">The moonke is burnt.</note>
with his prince (for so he tooke it) caused him to be burnt for his vntruth. Thas was the
wretch righteouslie recompensed, as he had most iustlie deserued. In the meane time, the
gouernour returning homewards, through force of the venem still increasing, deceassed at Muscleburgh, and was buried at Dunfirmling, in the y&eacute;ere of our redemption 1331. [He left

<p>After his deceasse, by common consent of the three estates of the realme in councell 
<note place="marg">The gouernours chosen to rule Scotland.</note>
assembled, Patrike earle of March, and Dauid earle of Mar were chosen gouernors, the first: that is
to say, the earle of March) had the charge of that part of the realme which lieth on the south
side of the Forth, and the other (that is to say, the earle of Mar) was appointed to gouerne all
that on the north side. Shortlie after rose great trouble in Scotland by meanes of Edward
Balioll, the sonne of Iohn Balioll before remembred, as thus: It chanced there was one 
<note place="marg">Twinam Lorison.</note>
Twinam Lorison, a gentleman borne, but spotted with vile conditions, as adulterie, and diuerse
other, for the which being put vnder censures of the church by the officall of Glascow: he
tooke at length the same officiall as he was going toward the towne of Aire, and held him in
captiuitie, till he had paied two hundred pounds for his deliuerance. But this iniurie remained
not long vnpunished: for sir Iames Dowglasse, before his passage to the holie land, would not
suffer him to rest, till he had constreined him to fl&eacute;e into England for his more safegard.</p>
<p>At his comming into England, he met with Dauid Cumin earle of Atholl, and manie other
<note place="marg">Scotish lords banished into England.</note>
Scotishmen, which were banished in times past by king Robert, for that they assisted the king
of England against him. These persons being driuen out of the realme, and confederat altogither in one band, remained in England long time after, euer trusting to s&eacute;e some occasion
offered, whereby they might one day returne againe into their owne natiue countrie. And
now, hearing that earle Thomas Randall the gouernour was deceassed, this Twinam Lorison
<note place="marg">Twinam Lorison sent vnto Edward Balioll.</note>
in name of them all was sent ouer into France to persuade Edward Balioll to attempt the recouerie of the crowne and realme of Scotland, as the rightfull heritage of his father, and descended vnto him as lawfull and rightfull heire. Though the Balioll had no regard to make anie
claime at all to the crowne of Scotland before this time, yet through the pithie persuasions of
the earnest messenger, declaring how easiea matter it were for him to atchiue, considering the
aid which he should haue in England, both at the kings hands, and also by the Scotishmen

towards the atteining of the crowne of Scotland, which if he might bring to passe with pro perous successe, he promised to hold the same of him and his successors as superior lords thereof.
King Edward gladlie vpon that condition, condescended to his request, notwithstanding the
aliance contracted with king Dauid, by the mariage of him with his sister. Heerewith he appointed foorth six thousand men well apparelled and araied for the warre, to passe by sea with
the Balioll, and other the confederats into Scotland, trusting that vpon their arriuall there,
they should find no small number of friends to assist them. For beside the Balioll, there was
the lord Henrie Beaumount a Frenchman, who had maried the earle of Buchquhanes daughter
and heire: also the earles of Atholl &amp; Angus [the lords Persie and Wake, Richard Talbot,
Henrie Ferres, Iohn Mowbraie] &amp; other Scotish lords such as were banished Scotland, when
K. Robert le Bruse recouered it out of the Englishmens hands. These were appointed to go
with the Balioll to assist him in that enterprise: and likewise the lord Stafford, and diuerse
other English capteins, wherevpon when all their prouision was once readie, with the number
appointed them by king Edward, and a few others, they got them a shipboord, and sailing

<note place="marg">Alexander Seiton is slaine.</note>
foorth by the coast till they entered into the Forth, at length they came on land n&eacute;ere the
towne of Kingorne, and shortlie after, incountring with Alexander Seiton, they slue him, and
put his folkes to flight.</p>
<p>Balioll verie ioifull of this happie successe, came with his people to Perth, otherwise called
S. Iohns towne, whereof the earles of Mar and March being aduertised, they raised two mightie
<note place="marg">The earles of Mar and March gather their people.</note>
armies, and hasted toward the enimies, not as though they should haue to doo with men of
warre, but to chastise a number of th&eacute;eues and robbers that were come out of England. Yet at
length they concluded to ioine both togither in Stratherne, that they might iointlie set vpon
their enimies both at once. The Balioll s&eacute;eing the matter brought so far foorth, that no feare
of death nor starting-hole by flight might auaile him, boldlie came forward, and pitched downe
his tents at Duplin n&eacute;ere to the water of Erne, trusting that if his armie would stand to it, and
<note place="marg">Edward Balioll at Duplin.</note>
fight with manlike constancie, he should weild his enimies well inough, notwithstanding their
huge number. The same night came the earle of Mar with his power, and incamped with the
same within sight of the English armie, but the earle of March lodged about fiue miles from
thence, at Othirardour.</p>
<p>The Scots that were with the earle of Mar, hauing knowledge of the small number of their
enimies, made no accounts of them, so that they neither tooke h&eacute;ed to their watch, nor to anie
<note place="marg">The negligence of the Scots.</note>
other order for defense of themselues, but fell to singing, dansing, reuelling, and drinking, in
most dissolute manner. The Balioll taking occasion h&eacute;ereof, determined to assaile them the
same night in their campe; and therevpon causing his people to make them readie to accomplish that enterprise, in the dead of the night he issued foorth of his campe, and comming vnto
the water of Erne, passeth the same by the foord, where one Andrew Murrey of Tullibard had
pight a stake of set purpose, in midst of the streame, to shew them the waie. Thus hauing
got all his armie ouer the water, without anie noise or din, so secretlie as might be deuised, he
entered the campe of his enimies, and brake through till he came to the tent of the earle of
Mar, the Scots generall, before he was once descried. H&eacute;ere at the first was the earle himselfe

murdering the Scots as then buried in sl&eacute;epe without all defense. And therevpon followed so
cruell slaughter, that nothing was heard but grunting and groning of people, as they lay on
heapes readie to die, weltering togither in their owne bloud. And if it had not b&eacute;ene that

straightwaies vnto Perth (otherwise called saint Iohns towne) and giuing assalt thereto,

quickelie entered it by force, without anie great resistance. The earle of March that lodged (as is
said) the same night that the battell was fought, not past flue miles off, hearing what had
chanced both in the battell and towne, came with his people arraied in good and perfect order
vnto Perth aforesaid, to besiege the Englishmen with Edward Balioll and other as then within

<p>Whereof when they of Galloway had aduertisement, because the king was their speciall

Makeswell, and inuaded the lands of those Scotishmen that had thus besieged their lord king
Edward Balioll, and by that means constreined the aduersaries to leuie their siege. Wherevpon earle Patrike and the new earle of Murrey, with the lord Andrew de Murrey, and the

The earle with his wife and children were sent to the castell of Kildrummie, there to remaine
vnder safe keeping; but Andrew Murrey for his treason afore committed, was beheadded.
The towne being thus woone, was deliuered to the k&eacute;eping of Iohn Lindseie. But Buchan. out

side, sent Iohn Randoll earle of Murrey into France vnto king Dauid, that by his means they
might purchase some aid of the French king to defend the realme from the force of the enimies.
In the meane time the king of England besieged Berwike both by sea and land,

notwithstanding such as were within it defended the towne so manfullie that he got but small gaines by

manie proper feats of armes were atchiued with variable fortune.</p>

<p>William Seiton bastard sonne to the capteine of the towne was taken prisoner, and his bastard brother, as he assailed the English ships one night ouer-fiercelie, was drowned by mischance in the sea. At length, when they within the towne began to want vittels, the

the space of 6 daies, if no succour came in the meane time to resist his siege, the towne
should be deliuered into his hands at the end of that terme; and for the assurance thereof, he
was contented that his eldest sonne and heire Thomas Seiton should remaine with the said
king in hostage. Whilest things passed thus at Berwike, the nobles of Scotland by common

Archembald Dowglasse raising a mightie armie of Scotishmen entered with the same into the
borders of England, so to withdraw king Edward from the siege of Berwike to defend his
owne lands from burning and spoiling. But king Edward aduertised hereof, deuised an
other shift; for immediatlie sending a messenger to sir Alexander Seiton capteine of the
towne, he certified him plainelie, that vnlesse he rendered the towne forthwith into his hands,
both his sonnes which he had with him, the one as hostage, and the other as prisoner, should
be without further delay hanged on a gibbet there in sight afore his owne face.</p>
<p>Sir Alexander Seiton hereto answered, that as yet the terme of the truce was not expired, &amp;
therefore desired the king either to obserue the couenants, or else to deliuer the pledges,
that he might be at his aduantage: but king Edward (as saith the Scotish chronicle) immediatlie caused a paire of gallows to be raised before the towne, and both the sonnes of sir
Alexander to be led thither, to suffer on the same without further respit. Sir Alexander
Seiton beholding that pitifull sight, and weieng with himselfe, that he might sane the liues of
those innocent creatures, if he would, was brought into great perplexitie of mind: the naturall affection and compassion which he bare towards his sonnes mouing him to haue

rendered the towne on the one side, and the dutie with faith promised to his king and countrie restraining him from all such resolution on the other. But in the end, the tender regard he had
to saue the liues of his sonnes, had ouercome him, and caused him to haue rendered the towne
into his enimies hand, had not his wife and mother to his said sonnes, exhorted him most
<note place="marg">The manlie stomach of Alexander Seitons wife.</note>
earnestlie to the contrarie, alleging that such reproch and dishonor should redound vnto them,
and their posteritie, if through their fault the towne were traitorouslie deliuered into the enimies hand, that from thenceforth they should be infamed for euer: and as for the death of
their sonnes, it was not to be counted a losse, for by this kind of death, they should win immortall name, &amp; leaue to their parents the high honor and renowme of faithfull &amp; loiall
subiects. Againe they were yoong inough to beget and bring foorth new children, where
they should be neuer able to recouer honor once lost; if by deliuering the towne into the

armie, fullie resolued to giue him battell, as well to reuenge the displeasure for the death of the
said gentlemen, as to deliuer the towne of Berwike from further danger of the enimies force.</p>
<p>Yet were there sundrie prudent councellors in the Scotish armie, that for diuers respects aduised him in no wise to fight with the enimies at that present, considering the huge number of
practised souldiers which they had amongest them, and the want of skilfull warriours on his
side, hauing few with him saue yoongmen, and such as lacked experience in the wars, for that
they had b&eacute;ene but little trained therein. Notwithstanding, he himselfe was of contrarie opinion, iudging that the good willes and desire which his people had to fight with the Englishmen,
should supplie their lacke of skill: and therevpon determining to trie the chance of battell
with them, commanded his armie to refresh themselues with meat, drinke, and sl&eacute;epe for
that night, and to prouide themselues readie for battell on the next morning. In the breake
of the day he arraied his people in order of battell. The vauntgard was giuen to Hugh, lord

ioined himselfe with Andrew Murrey gouernor of Scotland (for Dauid Bruse) hauing a
little before ransomed himselfe, with a great masse of monie out of the Englishmens hands.

England, came to him to Newcastell vpon Tine, who returning homeward, was grieuouslie
wounded of the people of Northumberland, for couetousnes, to haue robbed him of such
monie as K. Edward had liberallie bestowed vpon him.)</p>
<p>Not long after this, Edward Balioll came to Rainfrew, and there receiuing the people
<note place="marg">The castels of Rothsaie and Dunnone deliuered to the Balioll.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
into his obeisance, had the keies of the castell of Rothsaie and Dunnone, brought vnto him
by sir Alane Lile shiriffe of Bute [at what time the king gaue to him the k&eacute;eping of the
castell of Rothsaie, hauing before made him shiriffe.] Thus did the Balioll increase in
puissance, by such confluence of people as dailie submitted themselues vnto him, &amp; he
inriched them liberallie with lands and goods still as they came to him, thereby to win there
good wils. He sought by all meanes possible to haue gotten Robert Steward into his
<note place="marg">Robert Steward.</note>
hands, as the person whome he knew to haue most right, next vnto king Dauid, to the
crowne of Scotland: but through the diligent foresight of his friends, this Robert Steward
being about the age of fift&eacute;ene y&eacute;eres, was conueied [with bote and horsse, by the belpe
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
of William Hariot and Iohn Gilbert] to the castell of Dunbreton, where he was ioifullie
receiued by Malcolme Fleming the capteine.</p>
<p>The Balioll being sore offended, that such castels as were kept by his enimies, were so
great an impediment to his interprises, by succouring and relieuing his aduersaries to make
warres against him, he got togither an armie, and the next y&eacute;ere laid siege to the castell of
<note place="marg">Lochleuin besieged.</note>
Lochleuin: but perceiuing that this castell might not be woone without long siege, he
appointed sir-lohn Striueling to continue the siege with a great power of men, vntill the
castell were yeelded. There were left also with him, Michaell Hariot, Dauid Vemis, and
Richard Maleuill, with diuerse other. These capteins aduising the place and site of the
castell, lodged themselues within the churchyard of saint Serfe, beside Kinrosse, making
bastiles and other defenses within the same, for their more safegard. Within the castell
were two valiant capteins to defend it, the one named Alane Vepont and Iames Lambie,
<note place="marg">Alane Vep&omacr;t and Iames Lambie capteins of Lochleuin.</note>
citizens of saint Andrews.</p>
<p>The enimies assaied all the meanes that might be deuised to haue woone this castell, but
all was in vaine. At length, they deuised a subtill sleight, whereby to compasse their intent, on this wise. They went about to dam vp the mouth of the riuer where it issueth
<note place="marg">A deuise to drowne the castell.</note>
out of the Loch, with earth, tr&eacute;es, &amp; stones, that the water being so kept in, might rise
to such an height, that it should ouerflow the castell, and so drowne all the people within
it. And to cause the Loch to swell more speedilie, they turned the course of diuerse riuers
and brookes in the countrie thereabouts, and brought them into the same Loch. It chanced
at the same time, that sir Iohn Striueling capteine of the siege, with a great part of the
armie, went vnto Dunfirmling for deuotion sake, to visit the shrine of saint Margaret, sometime qu&eacute;ene of Scotland. Whereof Alane Vepont then capteine of the castell, hauing vnderstanding, about midnight prepared three botes, and taking certeine souldiers with him,

rowed foorth to the head of the dam or water, and there, with such engins as he had deuised for the purpose, assaied to boare through and make a hole in the banke or rampire
that kept vp the water, which when they had brought to passe, they returned quickelie
againe to the castell.</p>
<p>The water hauing once gotten an issue, within a while ware the hole so large, that
entering with more violence, it finallie brake downe the banke, and rushed foorth with such
an huge streame, that it bare downe all afore it, drowning vp the bastils and tents of them
<note place="marg">The bastiles and tents of them that lay at siege drowned.</note>
that lay at siege there, and caried the same with men and all downe into the d&eacute;epe sea, they
were so suddenlie taken, yer they could make anie shift to escape. Alane Vepont, when
the water was fallen to the old marke, issued foorth of the castell, &amp; setting vpon those that
had escaped the danger of the water, slue part of them, and put the remnant to flight.
Iohn Striueling hearing the mischiefe that had happened to his folks, returned to the siege,
and made a vow neuer to depart from thence, till he had taken the castell, and slaine all
them within it. But yet, after he had laine there a long time, and saw it was not possible
to win that fortresse, he was constreined to raise his siege, and to go his waies, after he had
lost thereat no small number of his people. This siege of Lochleuin chanced in the Lent
season, in the y&eacute;ere 1335.</p>

<p>In the y&eacute;ere following, king Edward prepared an armie both by sea and land, to enter into

the Forth: but by a sore tempest manie of those vessels perished betwixt Inchketh and the
North land. He himselfe hauing the Balioll in his companie, with fiftie thousand men,
came by land vnto Glascow, and perceiuing there was little for him to doo, for that no rebellion greatlie anie where appeared, he returned backe againe into England with the Balioll,
and left Dauid Cumin earle of Atholl gouernor in his roome, to subdue the residue of the
rebels, and to win those strengths, which as yet were defended against him. Dauid Cumin

left thus to be gouernor in Scotland, tooke vpon him the rule in name both of the king of
England, and also of the Balioll, and seized into his hands all those lands in Murrey and
Buchquhane, which perteined to Robert Steward, confiscating all the goods of such the inhabitants, as would not be sworne vnto him. [Who notwithstanding that hee was of such
great authoritie in Scotland, of credit with both kings, Edward of England, &amp; Edward of
Scotland, and of exc&eacute;eding great possessions of his owne, would yet neuer vsurpe anie
superioritie to him himselfe in stile, but passed all the grants and writings in the name of
Edward king of England, and of Balioll king of Scots. At what time none would publikelie
professe him a subiect to Dauid Bruse, but boies, who in their plaies &amp; games would alwaies
call their king, Dauid Bruse.]</p>
<p>Incontinentlie h&eacute;erevpon, Robert Steward assembled his friends by the helpe of Dungall
Campbell of Lochquhow, and suddenlie tooke the castell of Dunnone, sleaing all the

came with 400 men, and by the testimonie of Buch. was a man of great power in Argile.]
The commons of Bute and Arrane, glad of this prosperous beginning, assembled togither to
the number of foure hundred persons, and set forward, that they might come to support

alies [as Godfrie Rosse, and others] came into Clidesdaie, Ranfrew, Kile, Cunningham
and Aire, which togither with Ros and Murrey, they reduced to the obeisance of king

went vnto Aberden, and there learning where he soiorned, made thither with all sp&eacute;ed;

Dauid, and exhorting him to be as diligent in reconciling the people vnto king Dauid, as

time reuolted from the king of England, submitting themselues to king Dauid, as Aiexander
Ramsay, a verie skillfull warrior, Laurence Presion, Iohn Herring, and Iohn Haliburton

a strong armie, gathered of such as were wearied by the English gouernement, whereat
Dauid Cumin (being feared with the sudden assemblie) fled for his safetie, whome they
egerlie pursued, and taking him (being then beset in a narrow streict, and oppressed with
penurie of all things) they compelled him to y&eacute;eld (without anie more circumstances) to
their faction, who then swearing fealtie to Dauid Bruse, was permitted to depart vpon his
promise: wherevnto they gaue such faith, that they left him deputie for them. At what
time he did not faintlie dissemble the fauouring &amp; defending of the part of Bruse. In the
meane time, Randolph returned into Louthian, and ioined himselfe with his old friend
William Dowglasse latelie returned out of England, &amp; now with great slaughters of his
enimies egerlie reuenged the long lothsomnesse of his imprisonment: to whome also to
make their partie the stronger, came Andrew Murrey, which was taken at Bokesborowe.
Wherefore these gouernours sufficientlie garded with the nobilitie, appointed a parlement at
Perth, in the kalends of Aprill. Whither when the nobles came, there could not be anie

thing performed, by reason of the secret hartburning harbored in the bosoms of William
Dowglasse, and Dauid Cumin earle of Atholl: the cause whereof was pretended to be, in
that Dowglasse did obiect vnto Cumin, that it was by his meanes, that he was no sooner deliuered out of prison from the English: amongst which nobilitie, Steward fauored Cumin,
and almost all the other tooke part with Dowglasse. Which dissention amongst the nobilitie, was occasioned for suspect which they had of the Cumins comming to that place with
so great a traine: for he brought thither such number of his friends and followers, that he
was a terror to all the rest of the assemblie, to the increase of which suspicion, they further
ioined a conceit they had of Cumins great and changeable wit, his aspiring mind, and certeine rumors spred abroad of the comming of the English, with whome no man did doubt,

the Scotish writers wronglie name the duke of Gelderland) came into England with an
<note place="marg">Not the duke of Gelderland but Namure named Guy.</note>
armie, and purposing to passe thorough Scotland vnto the place where king Edward lay in
campe, to come to his aid, was discomfited on the Burrowe moore, beside Edenburgh, by
the power of the gouernours and others, which were there assembled against him. There
died manie on both parts in the fight (as Iohn Fourdon writeth) for the strangers fought
<note place="marg"><emph>Iohn Fourdon.</emph></note>
verie valiantlie: insomuch that if William Dowglasse, with diuerse other, had not come
<note place="marg">William Dowglasse commeth to the succour of the Scots.</note>
downe from Pictland hils to the aid of the Scots, whilest they were thus fighting, the
strangers that day had woone the victorie. But now discouraged with the sudden comming
of this fresh aid to their aduersaries, they began to giue place, and drew towards Edenburgh: neuerthelesse k&eacute;eping themselues in order of battell, they fought still: and at length
comming to Edenburgh, they were driuen vp thorough the friers street, and so by an other
street, called saint Marie Wind, where one sir Dauid de Anand, a verie valiant knight
<note place="marg">Dauid de Anand a Scotish knight.</note>
chanced to be wounded by one of the enimies, by reason whereof he was so kindled in
wrathfull desire to be reuenged, that with an axe which he had in his hand, he gaue his
aduersarie (that had hurt him) such a blow on the shoulder, that he claue him downe
<note place="marg">Hyperbole.</note>
togither with his horsse, that the axe staied not till it light vpon the verie hard pauement,
so as the print of that violent stroke remained to be s&eacute;ene a long time after in one of the
stones of the same pauement.</p>
<p>The strangers still retiring, and manfullie defending themselues, at length got to the hill
where Edenburgh castle standeth, and there slue their horsses, making as it were a rampier
of their carcasses, so to defend themselues from the force of their enimies: but being inuironed by the Scots on ech side all that night, and hauing neither meate nor drinke wherewith to susteine their languishing bodies, the which beside hunger and thirst, were sore
tormented with cold also, and want of conuenient lodging, they y&eacute;elded themselues the next
day, with condition to haue their liues saued. When the spoile of the field (where they
first ioined) was gathered, amongst the dead bodies there was found a woman of. an huge
<note place="marg">A woman of manlike force and stature.</note>
stature, who in the beginning of the battell stept foorth before hir companie, and incountering in singular fight with an esquire of Scotland, named Richard Shaw, she ouerthrew
him, and afterwards beating downe hir enimies on ech side, long it was yer she might
be ouerthrowne, which chanced not before she was inuironed about on ech side with hir
enimies.</p>
<p>The earle of Namure hauing y&eacute;elded himselfe into the hands of the gouernours, was
verie courteouslie vsed, the earle of Murrey not onelie rendering vnto him all his goods, but
also granting him licence to depart: and for his more suertie, he went himselfe in person
with him to the borders, to s&eacute;e him safe deliuered out of all dangers. But by a ambush

Dauid Cumin earle of Atholl, hearing that the earle of Murrey one of the gouernours was

with him, for doubt least when he had recouered the whole gouernement of the realme,
he should shrinke awaie from him. The earle of Atholl hauing now regained his former
authoritie, began to exercise great crueltie against all those that were enimies to the Balioll.</p>
<p>The nobles of the contrarie faction (as Patrike Dunbar earle of March, Andrew Murrey,
&amp; William Dowglasse, with other) tooke great despite therat, and raising an armie to restreine his insolent dooings, came towards him, whereof he being aduertised (as then lieng
at siege before the castle of Kildrummie) rose and met them in the fields within the forrest
of Kilblaine, where he gaue them a sore battell, and had gone awaie with the victorie, had not

<note place="marg">The earle of Atholl is slaine.</note>
with Walter Bride, Robert Cumin, and a great number of other, both gentlemen and
commons. Sir Thomas Cumin was taken prisoner, &amp; beheaded the next day, being Newy&eacute;eres day. For the battell before mentioned was fought the last day of December (as
Fourdon noteth.) Who further saith, that the earle of Atholl had with him thr&eacute;e thousand
<note place="marg"><emph>Fourdon.</emph></note>
men against his aduersaries, which were not past eleuen hundred.</p>
<p>* This Dauid earle of Atholl was verie inconstant &amp; gr&eacute;edie of gouernment, who if he

had brought all the Scots to haue taken king Edwards part, would out of doubt, haue afterward contended with king Edward, and inuaded the kingdome of Scotland by violence;
he did most grieuouslie oppresse the giltlesse and poore people, and wickedlie ordered all
things after his own fansie, without reason.) Cumin earle of Atholl was slaine on this
wise: Andrew Murrey was chosen gouernour in place of the earle of Murrey, taken (as
<note place="marg">Andrew Murrey chosen gouernor.</note>
before is said) by the Englishmen. This Andrew Murrey in the beginning of his new
office, laid siege to the castle of Couper, with a mightie power of men, but hearing that
the Cumins made foule woorke in the north parts of the realme, against such as fauoured
<note place="marg">The Cumins put to flight.</note>
not the English part, he left that siege, and went against them, with whome incountering
in battell, he ouerthrew their armie, and put them all to flight.</p>
<p>At this bickering were slaine two of the Cumins, Robert and William, Thomas Caldar,
and diuerse other valiant men, though enimies for the time vnto the gouernour. This
victorie reduced all the north parts of Scotland vnto the obeisance of king Dauid. Few

it slaine, except Henrie Beaumont the capteine, who being sworne neuer to returne againe
into Scotland, was licenced by the gouernour to depart into England without anie interruption. After this, the gouernour came to the castle of Lochindoris, and laid siege to it,
where within was the countesse of Atholl, the wife of the late slaine earle Dauid. This
woman hauing knowledge aforehand, that hir house should be besieged, had sent vnto the
king of England and to Edward Balioll for succours.</p>
<p>The king of England now doubting least all the strengths in Scotland, kept by such as
were his friends, would be lost without recouerie, if the same were not the sooner rescued,
he raised an armie of fortie thousand men, and entering therewith into Scotland, came to

the castle of Lochindoris aforsaid. The Scots that lay there at siege, vpon knowledge had of
his comming towards them, brake vp, and departed from thence. H&eacute;erevpon, when he
had refreshed the hold with new men, munition, and vittels, he tooke the countesse foorth
with him, and passed with bloudie swoord thorough Murrey, euen to Elghine, and returning
by Mar, burnt the towne of Aberden. [Then he went to Striueling, where he stronglie

he made the castle stronger, in which he placed a valiant garrison: to this fort the lord
Berkeleie conueied vittels from Edenburgh, and in one night discomfited William Dowglasse
that lay in wait to intercept him. After which, king Edward did shortlie lose all the said
castels, which he had before with so great care fortified.] His nauie being on the sea at

the same time, entered into the Forth, and spoiling (as other had doone afore time) the church
of saint Colme, felt reuenge thereof shortlie after: for that ship (as they tell the tale) wherein
saint Colmes goods (for so they call them) were laden, soonke to the bottome of the sea, without force of anie tempest, or other apparant occasion.</p>
<p>The king of England at his comming to Perth, foorth of the north parts of Scotland, and
<note place="marg">The towne of Perth newlie fortified.</note>
finding the towne vnfortified, caused the same to be newlie fensed with wals and bulworks,
at the charges and onelie expenses of these six abbeies, Aberbrothoke, Couper, Lundoris,
Balmerinoch, Dunfirmling, &amp; saint Andrewes. Henrie Beaumont also, who contrarie to his
oth before taken, was now returned with king Edward into Scotland, was made capteine of
saint Andrewes. Also Henrie Ferrar was made capteine of the castle of Lucres, William
Montacute of Striueling,William Felton of Rockesburgh, and the k&eacute;eping of the towne of
Perth was committed vnto one Thomas Vthred. Whilest king Edward or lered things in
Scotland after this maner, his brother (surnamed by the Scotish writers Eltaam) came vnto
him at Perth, who in the west parts of Scotland had exercised much crueltie, as well against the
enimies of the Englishmen, as against those that were fauourers and friends vnto them, insomuch that passing through Galloway, Carike, Kile, and Cuningham, he put all to the fier and
<note place="marg">His crueltie.</note>
swoord that came in his waies. He burned the church of saint Bute, and a thousand persons
within it, which were fled thither for safegard of their liues. At his comming to Perth, he
found the king his brother within the church there, who being sore offended with him for
his misordered dooings, verie sharpelie reprooued him for the same: and forsomuch as he 
<note place="marg">K. Edward sleieth his brother Eltham.</note>
answered him somewhat frowardlie, he plucked foorth his swoord, and there thrust him through
the bodie, euen before the altar of saint Iohn, wishing that all such might perish on the same
wise, as put no difference betwixt friend and fo, place hallowed and vnhallowed; as being no
reason, that the church should be anie more refuge for him, than he had made it for other.</p>
<p>It may be, that king Edward slue some other man in this sort, as the Scots h&eacute;ere doo write:
but for the earle of Cornewall that was brother to king Edward, and surnamed Iohn of Eltham,
because he was borne at Eltham, it is nothing true that he was so made awaie, for he died of

<note place="marg">He winneth the castle of Kincleuin.</note>
a naturall infirmitie, as by our English writers it manifestlie app&eacute;ereth. But now to proc&eacute;ed
with the historie, as we find it written. Such things accomplished in Scotland (as before ye
haue heard) king Edward returned into England, &amp; left the Balioll behind him with a great
power of men at Perth. About the same time, Henrie Beaumont slue all such Scots as he
might lay hands on, that had beene at the battell of Kilbleine, where his coosine Dauid Cumin
was slaine. Moreouer now, after that king Edward was returned into England, Andrew
Murrey came foorth of the mounteins, into the which he was before withdrawen to esch
the furie of the Englishmen, and by the assistance of sundrie of the nobles of Scotland, he wan
the castle of Kincleuin, and rased it to the earth. Shortlie after he came into Mernes, and
there tooke the castle of Kilnesse, and likewise rased the same. Then passing forward, he
burned Dunnoter.</p>
<p>On the other part, the Englishmen made no lesse spoile and destruction on ech side where
they came, so that the Mernes, Angus, Stermond, and Gowrie through spoile, murther, &amp;

<note place="marg">The victorie of Andrew Murrey gotten at Panmore Henrie Mountfort slaine.</note>
other disgraces, chancing by continuall warre, were left in manner waste and desolat. At
length, this Andrew Murrey assembling a great power, with support of them of Murrey,
Mar, and Buchquhan, fought with his enimies at Panmore in Angus, where he obteined the
victorie with huge slaughter of Englishmen, and other his aduersaries. In this battell was slaine
Henrie Mountfort, who latelie before had b&eacute;ene sent by king Edward into Scotland to support
the Balioll, beside foure thousand others, the most part gentlemen: so that this ouerthrow
was verie displeasant to the king of England, hauing his side sore weakened thereby. After
the gaine of this victorie, Andrew Murrey passed thorough Fife &amp; Angus, ouerthrowing the
castle of Lucres, with all the other strengths of Fife, the castle of Couper onelie excepted.</p>

the towne. By meanes whereof, the Scots remooued and came to Clerkington, and the English came to Krethtowne not farre distant; betw&eacute;ene whome there was a great fight, and
manic slaine on both sides. But the victorie inclining (without anie great conquest) to neither partie, both armies parted: for the English went ouer Tweed, and the Scots feining that
they would go into England, lodged themselues at Galuschell. So that king Edward hearing
of such prosperous successe chancing to his aduersaries, sent incontinentlie two capteins with

<p>William Tailbois a man of notable prowes, hauing the conduct of the one of these armies,
was incountred by William Keith, and after the discomfiture of his people, being taken
prisoner, was kept in captiuitie till he paid two thousand marks for his ransome. The other
was led by Richard Mountfort with whome Laurence Preston and Robert Gordon met, and
giuing him battell, slue the same Richard with the most part of all his companie. About
the same time sir William Montacute earle of Salisburie, togither with the earle of Arundell
came into Scotland with a great power of men, and besieged the castell of Dunbar, lieng
at the same for the space of 22 w&eacute;eks. [At which battell also was king Edward, the earle
of Glocester, the lords Persie and Neuill, being in the yeare 1337, as saith <emph>Scala chron.</emph>]
Within the said castell was the countesse hir selfe, surnamed blacke Agnes of Dunbar, who
shewed such manlie defense, that no gaine was to be got anie waies forth at hir hands, so
that in the end they were constreined to raise their siege, and to depart without sp&eacute;ed of
their purpose. It is said, that this countesse vsed manie pleasant words in iesting and
tawnting at the enimies dooings, thereby the more to incourage hir souldiers.</p>
<p>One day it chanced that the Englishmen had deuised an engine called a sow, vnder

<note place="marg">A great dearth and also a death in Scotland.</note>
was such a dearth through all the bounds of Scotland, with such mortalitie of people, as a
greater had not lightlie b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene nor heard of. The cause of which mortalitie proc&eacute;eded (as was thought) for that the ground lay vntilled and not occupied, by reason of the
continuall warres before passed. [The marchers of England (that were left behind the

lords that went into Scotland) were discomfited at Preffen: where Robert Maners was taken,
with manie other prisoners, beside a multitude that were slaine, by reason of certeine displeasant words amongest them, which caused that they brake order, diuided themselues,
and fought in an inconuenient place.] All the souldiers that kept the castell of Couper, for
<note place="marg">The castell of Couper left void.</note>
lacke of vittels left the house void, and comming to the sea side, hired a ship to haue passed

so were cast away. About the same time the most part of all their strengths and fortresses
<note place="marg">The castell of Louthian in the hands of the Englishmen.</note>
in Louthian were kept by Englishmen.</p>
<p>The towne of Edenburgh was stuffed with a great number of souldiers, both Englishmen
and Scots. Amongest whome there was a Scot of a right stout stomach named Robert Pendergest; he, for that it was perceiued he loued but little the English nation, was euill intreated and vsed amongst them, in so much that on a day, hauing his head broken by the marshall named Thomas Knatoun, he ceassed not to s&eacute;eke some meane to be reuenged, till he
brought his purpose to passe, so that shortlie after he slue the said marshall, and afterward
to auoid the danger of death due for that fact, he got away, and came to William Dowglas,
whome he persuaded with all diligence to passe vnto Edenburgh, where he might find his enimies at some great aduantage, by reason of the slothfull negligence as then growne amongest
them. William Dowglas following this aduertisement, came secretlie on a night vnto the
foresaid towne, and slue foure hundred Englishmen snorting in sl&eacute;epe and dronkennesse, before they were able to make anie resistance.</p>

England entering into wars against France, was constreined to ceasse his pursute of the conquest
which he minded to make in Scotland, the which must n&eacute;eds haue come to full effect, if he
had followed his former purpose and intent. But to proc&eacute;ed, after the deceasse of Andrew
Murrey the gouernor, Robert Steward tooke all the charge on him for the gouernment of the

this time, by the high prowes and manlie valiancie of William Dowglas and other Scotish
capteins; and therefore in the reward of the good seruice shewed by the same William in
conquest of that countrie, he inioied the same afterward as his rightfull inheritance. [Henri
earle of Lancaster and Derbie, hearing of the valure of these two woorthie capteins, William Dowglas, and Alexander Ramseie, earnestlie desired to s&eacute;e them, and to trie their
strengths in iusting. Wherevpon, there was a day appointed therefore at Berwike by all the
said parties, where they me, with their complices prouided accordinglie. At what time a
certeine Englishman asked Peter Grame, if he would not refuse to iust with him, to whome
he answered, that he accepted the chalnge, but willed him first to dine well, because he
should that night sup in paradise. Which fell out accordinglie, for in running togither the
Englishman was slain.] The king of England mooued with high displeasure at these dooings,
sent a right valiant knight named sir Thomas Berkleie with a great power of men into

him battell at Blackeborne, where the Scots were discomfited and so beaten downe, that few

of them escaped, which were not either slaine or taken. Notwithstanding the two capteins
saued themselues by flight.</p>
<p>Not long after, William Dowglas fought with his enimies at the Cragings, where hauing
not past fortie men in his companie, he discomfited sir Iohn Striueling, who had with

fiue times in one day with sir Laurence Abernethie, principall capteine vnder the Balioll, and
being put to the woorse at foure of those times, at the fift he vanquished his enimies, and
tooke prisoner their capteine the said sir Laurence, who was sent to the castell of Dunbreton,

eftsoones the castell of Couper to the king of Englands vse, but by persuasion of this
William Dowglas, he rendered it vp againe, and departed with bag and bag gage. Those
Scots that had serued vnder him likewise, were content to forsake the king of Englands

the same ship to be to him againe restored, and with great thanks and liberall rewards giuen

Etrike, in a tempestuous time, he came backe againe to Melrosse, where Henrie earle of
Lancaster iusted with William Dowglasse (by couenant) in the kings sight. King Edward
taking a truce, departed from Melrosse, halfe ouercome with melancholie against those that

<note place="marg">A sore dearth.</note>
there was such a miserable dearth, both through England and Scotland, that the people
were driuen to eat the flesh of horsses, dogs, cats, and such like vnused kinds of meats, to
susteine their languishing liues withall, yea, insomuch that (as is said) there was a Scotishman, an vplandish felow named Tristicloke, spared not to steale children, and to kill women,
<note place="marg">Children eaten.</note>
on whose flesh he fed, as if he had b&eacute;ene a woolfe. Perth being once deliuered (as before
is said) to the gouernor, he went with his armie to Striueling, and besieging the castell,

Dowglas hauing acquaintance with one Walter Towers, [whom Buchanan called William

as though he were a merchant, and to offer wines to sell vnto the garison that kept Edenburgh castell. This Towers according to instructions thus giuen him, prouided him of all
<note place="marg">A policie.</note>
things necessarie for the purpose, &amp; so comming into the Forth with his ship, came on
land himselfe, and brought with him into Edenburgh two punchions of wine, which he
offered to sell vnto the steward of houshold to the capteine of the castell, who falling at a
price with him, appointed that he should bring them earlie in the morning vp to the castell,
that they might be receiued in. Towers hiring a cart ouer night, came with the punchions vp

gates opened, entred with his cart, and being come within the gates with it, he plucked
foorth a wedge or pin deuised of purpose, and immediatlie therewith the cart with the punchions fell downe, so stopping the entrie of the gates, that in no wise they might be shut
or closed againe.</p>
<p>The Dowglasse hauing in his companie William Bullocke, Walter Fraseir, and Iohn Sandlands, right valiant knights, with diuerse other hardie and bold personages, laie in couert
not far from the castell, &amp; hauing knowledge giuen him by sound of horne, or otherwise,

them thus open, first slue the porters, and after into the castell, within a while had dispatched all them within, and so became maisters of that fortres, within the which for capteine they left one William Dowglas, the bastard brother of the other William Dowglas, by
whose conduct chieflie, both this enterprise and diuers other were luckilie atchiued. Thus
was the realme of Scotland clearelie recouered out of the enimies hands, the Englishmen,
and all other that tooke part with the Balioll, constreined to auoid out of all the parts and

and arriued in Innerberuie, from whence with no small triumph they were conueied vnto
Perth. About the same time, Alexander Ramsey of Dalehouse, one of the most valiant
capteins knowne in those daies, gathering a great power of men, entered into England, and
hauing knowledge that the Englishmen were assembled, in purpose to giue him battell, laid
an ambush for them, and training them within danger thereof, by such a fierce and new
onset as he gaue vpon them, he put them out of order, and chased them most egerlie, killing
and slaieng a great number of them at his pleasure. Amongest the prisoners that were
taken, the earle of Salisburie (as the Scotish historie saieth) was one, and the capteine of
Rokesburgh another.</p>
<p>Sir Alexander Ramsey, perceiuing that the most part of the garrison of Rokesburgh were
either slaine, or taken in this last conflict, togither with their capteine, came hastilie thither,
and giuing a right fierce assault thereto, by fine force tooke it. Wherefore king Dauid in
recompense of his valiancie thus declared in his seruice, gaue vnto him the k&eacute;eping of this
castell, togither with the shirifwike of Tiuidale. Whereat William Dowglasse tooke such
displeasure, that seeking to be reuenged, he found meanes to apprehend this Alxander

where he remained in great miserie and lacke of food till he died. [About which time
by the said kind of death (as saith Buchanan) was William Bullocke slaine, by Dauid
Berkelie. The death of which two did draw Scotland into manie factions, and filled it with
seditions.]</p>
<p>King Dauid was sore mooued herewith, purposing to s&eacute;e such punishment doone
William Dowglasse for that rebellious attempt, as might serue for an example to all other
how they went about anie the like offense. Neuerthelesse, the Dowglasse kept him out of
the way amongst the mounteins and other desert places, till finallie Robert Steward and
other nobles purchased his pardon, so that at length he came into fauor againe, and had all
his lands and liuings restored vnto him, as well in Tiuidale as elsewhere.</p>

the former trouble of war, he called a parlement at the towne of Perth, where he rewarded
verie liberallie all such as had either done any notable seruice themselues, or had lose any
of their friends or parents in defense &amp; recouerie of the relme out of his aduersaries hands.
Among other, Hugh Boece had in recompense of his fathers slaughter at Duplin, the in
heritor &amp; ladie of the baronie of Balbrid giuen him in mariage, which baronie is yet possessed by the heires of the said Hugh.</p>
<p>Shortlie after vpon the breaking vp of this parlement, king Dauid raised a mightie armie,
<note place="marg">King Dauid inuadeth Northumberland.</note>
and entered with the same into Northumberland; but committing the whole charge to
Iohn Randolph erle of Murrey as lieutenant generall, he wold not that anie of his owne
banners should be spred and borne in all that voiage [although himselfe were there in 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
person, seruing secretlie, and would not be knowne in this iournie.] The most part of all
Northumberland was burnt and spoiled, for they remained there a moneth before they returned, conueieng awaie with them great riches, which they got abroad in all places where
they came. Shortlie after, he came with a new armie into England, causing his own
<note place="marg">King Dauid the second time inuadeth the English borders.</note>
standard to be caried afore him at that time, as he that tooke vpon him the whole gouernance
of that enterprise himselfe. The Englishmen withdrawing all their goods into strengths,
minded not to giue the Scots any set batell, but to take them euer at some aduantage, if
they straied abroad any where vnwarilie to fetch in booties. Neither were they altogither
disappointed of their hoped prey, for 5 Scotish knights, whose names were Steward,
<note place="marg">Fiue Scotish knights taken prisoners.</note>
Eglinton, Craggie, Boid, and Fullarton, pursuing their enimies on a time ouer fiercelie,
were taken prisoners, and after red&eacute;emed for great summes of monie. At length, king
Dauid perceiuing that he wasted but tine, returned into Scotland. But not long after he
went againe into England, in which iournie his people were so beaten with vehement stormes
<note place="marg">King Dauid the third time inuadeth England.</note>

<note place="marg">Foule weather.</note>
of raine and haile, that they had much adoo to saue themselues from perishing through the
vnmeasurable force of that so rigorous weather.</p>
<p>On the other side, the Englishmen that were gathered to resist against him, were in semblable maner n&eacute;ere hand destroied with the like rage of tempest. Herevpon king Dauid,
to the end that his enterprise should not s&eacute;eme altogither to want effect, ouerthrew sundrie
strong houses on the English borders, and so returned home without other damage either
doone or receiued. About the same time did Edward king of England besiege the towne
<note place="marg">Calis besieged.</note>
of Calis. The French king therfore deuising all waies possible whereby to saue that
towne, and to cause his aduersarie to raise his siege, sent ambassadors into Scotland, to 
<note place="marg">Ambassadors fr&omacr; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> French king into Scotland.</note>
require king Dauid, that with an armie he would enter into England, and doo what damage
he might vnto the Englishmen, to trie if by that meanes king Edward could be constreined
to leaue his siege, and to returne home for defense of his owne countrie and subiects. In
the meane time also (as I find in the Scotish chronicles) king Edward addressed his orators
<note place="marg">Ambassadors from the king of England into Scotland.</note>

<note place="marg">The king of Englands offers.</note>

<note place="marg">The Scots readie to helpe the French, &amp; hinder their neighbors the English.</note>
into Scotland, offering vnto king Dauid, vpon condition that peace might be had, to deliuer into his hands not onelie the towne of Berwike, but also Edward Balioll his old
aduersarie, for whose cause the warres had so long continued betwixt them.</p>
<p>These offers being proponed in councell, though some of the wiser sort gaue aduise that
in no condition they ought to be refused; yet the king himselfe (for loue that he had to
the French king with whome he had b&eacute;ene brought vp) and other of the nobles hauing
yoong heads, vpon desire to be reuenged of the Englishmen by practise of warres (wherevnto they were inclined) wold n&eacute;eds condescend to the French kings chargeable request,
&amp; refuse the king of Englands beneficiall offers. Wherevpon an armie was leuied, and 
<note place="marg">An armie raised to inuade England.</note>
solemne proclamation made, that all such as were able and fit to beare armour, should m&eacute;et
the king at a certeine day and place, which was to them in the same proclamation assigned.
The earle of Rosse therefore came with his people vnto Perth, and there made his musters
before the king: but in the night following he slue the lord of the Iles, with seuen of his
<note place="marg">The lord of the Iles slain by the earle of Rosse.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
kinsmen as they were in their beds, and therevpon fled, and got him with all speed againe

<p>King Dauid, though he was sore displeased herewith, and desired most earnestlie to haue
punished that heinous act; yet bicause he would not hinder his iournie, he let passe the
punishment therof till more conuenient opportunitie might serue thereto. [Notwithstanding
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
that William Dowglasse of Lidesdale did earnestlie persuade him, at that time to leaue the
lournie, and first to punish these turmoils at home, whereby all things might be quieted in
his absence.] At his comming to the borders, and before he entered into England, he made
<note place="marg">William Dowglasse created earle of Dowglasse.</note>
manie knights, to stirre them the rather to doo valiantlie; but first he created William
Dowglasse an earle, which William was sonne to Archembald Dowglasse, slaine before at
Halidon hill. There was vndoubtedlie a mightie power of the Scots assembled at that 
<note place="marg"><emph>Ri. Southwell.</emph></note>
present; insomuch as there was of earles, lords, knights, and gentlemen, to the number of
two thousand men of armes; and of such armed men as they called hoblers, set foorth by
<note place="marg">Two thousand men of armes, 20000 hoblers.</note>
the burrowes and good townes twentie thousand; beside the archers and other footmen;
so that they were at the least fortie thousand men in all, or (as some writers affirme) thr&eacute;e
score thousand.</p>
<p>King Dauid with that his puissant armie, the sixt of October entered Northumberland,

<note place="marg">The fort of Lidell.</note>
and comming to a fortresse not farre off from the borders called Lidell, they laie round
about that place for the space of thr&eacute;e daies, without giuing thereto anie assault: but the
fourth day they assailed it right fiercelie, and in the end entered by fine force, sleaing the
more part of all those which they found within the house. The capteine sir Walter Selbie
<note place="marg">Sir Walter Selbie beheaded by the Scots.</note>
was taken aliue, but immediatlie by king Dauid his commandement, had his head striken
off, and was not permitted to haue so much time as to make his confession, which he
instantlie desired to haue doone, but it would not be granted. From thence the armie remooued, and went vnto the abbie of Lauercost, which they spoiled; and that doone they
<note place="marg">Lauercost.</note>
departed, and passing by Naward castell, and the towne of Redpeth, kept on till they came
vnto the priorie of Hexham, which they sacked; but the towne was saued from fire by
commandement of king Dauid, who in this iournie appointed to preserue foure townes
onelie from burning; to wit, Hexham aforesaid, Corbridge, Darington, and Durham, to
the end he might in them lay vp such store of vittels, as he should prouide abroad in the
countrie, wherewith to susteine his armie during the time of his abiding in those parties.</p>
<p>From Hexham, where he laie thr&eacute;e daies, he marched to Ebchester, wasting and spoiling
<note place="marg">King Dauid lodged in the manor of Beaurepaire.</note>
the countrie on each hand, and after turned towards the wood of Beaurepaire; and comming thither, lodged himselfe in the manour, and set his people abroad into the countrie
to fetch in booties, &amp; to burne vp the townes and houses in all places where they came.
The spoile, waste, destruction, and slaughter which the Scots practised with fire and sword,
was woonderfull to heare, and incredible almost to be told, they spared neither yoong nor
old, church nor chappell: religious houses as well as other were consumed to ashes. The
abbeie of Durham, and all places thereabout (as the Scotish writers affirme) were spoiled
<note place="marg">The abbeie of Durham spoiled.</note>
and miserablie sacked, although it was said king Dauid was admonished in a dreame, that

these iniuries, raised a great power of men, and ioining the same with such bands of old
souldiers as king Edward had latelie sent ouer out of France for that purpose, first dispatched
an herald at armes vnto king Dauid, requiring him to staie from further inuading the
countrie, and to returne into Scotland, till some reasonable order for a finall peace might be
agr&eacute;ed vpon betwixt him and the king his maister: otherwise he should be sure to haue
battell to the vtterance within three daies after. King Dauid contemning this message, required his folks to make them readie to receiue their enimies if they came to assaile them,
and on the next morrow, he diuided his armie into thr&eacute;e battels. In the first was Robert
Steward prince of Scotland, and Patrike Dunbar earle of March: in the second were 
<note place="marg">The appointing of the Scotish battels.</note>

himselfe, with all the residue of the nobles. [Contrarie to the which Buchanan placeth
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
Dowglasse in the first, the king in the middle, and Steward in the third.]</p>
<p>In the morning earlie before the battell, the earle of Dowglasse departed from the armie
<note place="marg">The earle of Dowglas chased.</note>
to descrie the English host, and to vnderstand their force and order (if it were possible:)
but entring somwhat vnwarilie within danger of his enimies, he was chased, and that to
such disaduantage, that he lost fiftie, or rather fiue hundred (as some bookes haue) of
yoong gentlemen, and such other light horssemen as he tooke foorth with him, escaping
verie narrowlie himselfe also from being taken at the chase. In the meane season, the English host diuided likewise into thr&eacute;e battels, approched forward, and came within sight of
the Scotish armie. Wherevpon Dauid Graham with a wing of fiue hundred horssemen,
well appointed gaue a full charge on the skirts of the English archers, thinking to haue distressed them: but he was so sharpelie receiued and beaten with arrowes, that losing a great
<note place="marg">Dauid Graham driuen backe.</note>
number of his men, he was constreined to fl&eacute;e backe to the maine battell, and that not
without great danger of being taken in his flight by such as followed him.</p>
<p>These two discomfitures notwithstanding, the Scots rushed fiercelie vpon their enimies, &amp;
fought with great manhood a lorg season; but in the end, Robert Steward, and the earle
of March, perceiuing their people partlie to shrinke backe, caused the retreat to be sounded,
in hope to saue their men by withdrawing into some safer place: but this flieng backe of
the earle of March and Robert Steward, brought the discomfiture vpon all the residue of
<note place="marg">The cause of the ouerthrow.</note>
the Scots. For that battell of Englishmen that was first matched with them, came now with
such violence vpon the maine battell where king Dauid fought, that within a short while
after, the same was vtterlie discomfited and put to flight. In this businesse king Dauid
<note place="marg">The Scots discomfited.</note>
himselfe did in euerie point plaie the part of a most valiant chiefteine, incouraging his people
as well with woords as notable examples to doo their indeuours. Neither would he flie
after hee saw himselfe destitute of all conuenient aid, but still continued in earnest fight,
<note place="marg">King Dauid his valiancie.</note>
desiring nothing so much (as should appeare) as death, for that he thought nothing more
displeasant than life, after the slaughter of so manie of his nobles and liege people.</p>
<p>At length hauing his weapons striken out of his hands, one Iohn Copland came vnto
<note place="marg">King Dauid taken by Iohn Copland.</note>
him, and willed him to y&eacute;eld; but he with one of his fists gaue this Copland such a
blow on the mouth, that by force of the gantlet he strake out two of his t&eacute;eth before he did
y&eacute;eld vnto him. Which Copland is misnamed by Iohn Maior, and not onelie called Couptaunt, but also reported by him to be a Gascoigne, whereas it is euident by our histories,
that he was named Copland, and a meere Englishman. But to our purpose. The Scots
that fought in the rereward had no better successe than the other: for that battell was also
broken &amp; put to flight, with great slaughter as well of the nobles, as other commons, besides those that were taken. There were slaine in this dolorous conflict, the earle of

they call it) of holie rood house, was found vpon king Dauid, who bare it about him, in
trust that by vertue thereof he should be inuincible: but he was spoiled both of that and
all other his iewels which were found vpon him at the same time. This battell was striken

countrie, who gathering the preies, draue them in despite alongst the castle: wherevpon
Thomas Greie, capteine of Norham (sonne to Thomas Greie, that had b&eacute;ene thr&eacute;e times by
the Scots besieged in the said castle of Norham, in the reigne of king Edward the second)
s&eacute;eing the commons of England thus robbed (and d&eacute;eming it his part to defend his
countrie, friends, and their substance) issued foorth of Norham with few men more than
fiftie of the garrison of the castle, and a few of the common people vnexpert in matters
of war; who (not knowing of the secret ambush of the band which Patrike had laied in
wait behind Tw&eacute;ed) issued foorth to follow and recouer the preie: but being so farre gone
in chase of the enimie, as that he could not returne in safetie (because he was beset before
and behind with the 400 on the one side, &amp; the ambush laied by Tw&eacute;ed on the other side)
the said Greie and his companie (finding none other remedie but to hazard the successe)
forsooke their horsses, and on foot (standing to the extremitie) with a woonderfull courage
set vpon the Scots, whereof more were killed than of the English, but the Scots comming
so sore on the English (not able to resist) they began to flie, at what time Thomas Greie
(as before is declared) was taken prisoner.)</p>
<p>The earles of March, and Dowglasse, after the obteining of this victorie, came suddenlie
in the night season vnto the towne of Berwike, and raising vp ladders to the wals, wan the

towne, but not without losse of diuerse Scotish gentlemen, as Thomas Vaus, Andrew Scot
of Balwerie, Iohn Gordon, William Sinclare, Thomas Preston, and Alexander Mowbraie
knights. Of English were slaine Alexander Ogill capteine of the towne, Thomas Persie
brother to the earle of Northumberland, and Edward Greie, with others. Eugenie de
Garenteris with his Frenchmen did verie valiantlie beare himselfe in this enterprise, whome
Robert Steward the gouernour rewarding with great gifts, sent backe into France, commending him by letters vnto the French king, as he that had doone his dutie in euerie behalfe verie throughlie. The castle of B&eacute;rwike, notwithstanding that the towne was thus
woone, held foorth the Scots and Frenchmen, by reason whereof when an armie of Englishmen came to the succours thereof, they raced the wals, and burnt the houses of the towne,

the burgesses amazed, treated with him, and therevpon the towne of Berwike was redeliuered (against the minds of the Scots) to king Edward.) K. Edward himselfe being

receiued of the Balioll a full resignation of all his pretended right to the crowne of Scotland. [For there the 26 of lanuarie, the said Balioll hauing resigned (as before) all his
title to king Edward, alledged these causes: first, in consideration that the Scots were full
of rebellion; also, because he had no heire, nor anie verie n&eacute;ere of his linage: and for that
he was of K. Edwards blood of England, he knew not where to bestow it better than vpon
him. This Balioll is by no author (as Lesleus saith) placed in the catalog of the kings, as
well for that he bound himselfe (by homage) to the gouernement of England with an oth,
against the gouernement &amp; maiestie of Scotland: as for that being a tyrant, &amp; by force inuading the crowne, he continued not long in the same. In truth, I suppose he held it not
verie long, and that in continuall warre. But yet for that which I can see, he was crowned
king at Scone, 1332, as Lesleus himselfe, Buchanan, and all other authors doo agr&eacute;e.
Beside, he gouerned by him &amp; his agents vntill the y&eacute;ere of 1342, at what time he y&eacute;elded
his crowne to king Edward of England; which was the full part of ten yeares, after which
againe he recouered a good part of England. Wherefore it s&eacute;emeth strange to me, that
Rosse will not allow him a place in the catalog of kings, since Buchan maketh him the
nintie fourth king, and so placeth him vnder that title, and maketh Dauid Bruse (who
was crowned before Balioll, and gouerned after Baliols departing Scotland) the 98 king,

ment; in such sort, that both these writing at one time (but with diuers affections) cannot
agr&eacute;e on the number of their kings: one receiuing, &amp; the other reiecting him to be placed
in the catalog of their kings.] After this, king Edward passing foorth to Hadington,
spoiled and wasted the countrie by the way on each hand as he marched forward; and for
displeasure that his nauie on the sea (after the souldiers and mariners had b&eacute;ene on land,
and burned the church of our ladie in those parts called Whitekirke) had with force of a
<note place="marg">Whitekirke burnt.</note>
rigorous tempest beene sore shaken, and manie of the ships lost and drowned togither with
men and all, he fell into such a rage, that he caused all the buildings in those parts to be
burnt and spoiled, as well abbeis as all other churches and religious houses, as though he
minded (say the Scotish writers) to make warre both against God and all his saints. These
things chanced in the yeare 1355, after our common account, about the feast of the

<note place="marg">The battell of Poitiers.</note>
Drisdale were in like maner recouered by one Kirpatrike. In the same y&eacute;ere on the 20

besides. There was at this battell with king Iohn, the earle William Dowglas, &amp; to the
number of thr&eacute;e thousand Scots, hauing diuers knights and gentlemen to their capteins, of
whome there died in the same battell Andrew Steward, Robert Gordon, Andrew Holieburton, and Andrew Vaus, knights. The earle of Dowglas escaped with life and vntaken,
but Archembald Dowglas, son to sir Iames Dowglas slaine in Spaine, was taken prisoner;
<note place="marg">Archembald Dowglasse taken prisoner.</note>
albeit his taker suffered him to depart for a small ransome, by reason that William Ramsey

<note place="marg">Two kings prisoners in England at one time.</note>
betwixt them at meate in the feast of Christmasse, making (as the vse is amongst the Englishmen in that season) a great banket. And this he did (as is reported) to the intent
that the maner thereof might be bruted abroad to his high praise &amp; glorious fame. King
Dauid within certeine yeares after was conueied by the earle of Northampton vnto Berwike, where the most part of all the nobles of Scotland assembled togither to consult with
him tuching some agr&eacute;ement to be had for his ransome: but because they could grow to
no certeine point therein, he was brought backe againe to London, and there remained in
prison as before. In the meane time, Roger Kirpatrike was slaine by lames Lindseie, in a

castell where the said Iames dwelled, and receiued the said Roger as his ghest. This
Lindseie fled vpon the fact committed; but yet being apprehended and brought to the gouernor Robert Steward, he suffered death for that offense.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, that is to wit at Michaelmasse next insuing, after king Dauid had b&eacute;ene

to giue the tenth pennie of all their fruits &amp; reuenues towards the paiment of the kings ransome

councell, wherein (according to his promise made to the king of England before his deliuerance) he mooued the lords and barons of Scotland in a matter whereof he wished not to
haue of them anie towardlie answer, and that was this: Whether they could be contented,
that after his deceasse, the crowne of Scotland should be transferred vnto the king of Englands sonne, and to his lawfull heires? [Which thing Iohn Maior assigneth to the yeare

so long as anie of them were able to beare armour or weapon, they would neuer consent
thereto. King Dauid right ioifull to heare them at this point, thought himselfe discharged,
for that he was not bound to labor further in this sute, because his promise made to the

the said king of Scots aduanced William Ramseie to the earldome of Fife, by the means
of the wife of the said Ramseie, whom the king intirelie loued (as the report went.) The
right of which countie king Dauid affirmed to be iustlie in him (so that he might liberallie
giue it) as truelie vested in his possession by the forfeiture which Duncan sometime countie
of Fife had doone in K. Robert Bruses daies; in murthering of an esquier called Michaell
Beton, whome he miserablie slue in a riuer for extreame displeasure. Wherefore this
William Ramseie surmized that Duncan (to obteine pardon for his offense) did by indenture
make Robert Bruse K. of Scots his heire in reuersion, if he died without issue male.
Yet had this Duncan a daughter (by his wife the countesse of Glocester, and daughter to
the king of England) which was enterteined in England, and should haue b&eacute;ene sold to
Robert the seneschall of Scotland. But she (rather respecting the satisfieng of hir loue,
than the honor of hir estate, rather choosing to be a kings wife, than an earles ladie) tooke
to husband one William Felton, a knight in Northumberland, which (at the said time when
William Ramseie was made earle of Fife) challenged that earldome in the right of his wife,
daughter and heire to the said Duncan earle of Fife. But for anie thing that I can yet s&eacute;e,
the said Ramseie went away with the honor thereof.] After this appeasing of certeine rebels
that sought to trouble the quiet state of the realme, he purposed to haue gone to Ierusalem:

set his louing affection vpon Katharine Mortimer, a damsell of London (by reason of
familiar acquaintance with hir) that he could not forbeare hir companie, but (as it

highlie offended with the king therefore, procured one Richard de Hull, a vallect of
Scotland (in feining some matter vnto hir from the king, as being sent in message
by him) to find meanes to rid hir out of life, which he did so couertlie, and handeled the matter so cunninglie, that he suddenlie murthered hir riding from Melros to

<p>He had to wife at the time of his atteining to the crowne, Eufemie daughter to Hugh
earle of Rosse, by whome he had two sonnes, Walter and Dauid. But before he was

maried to hir, he kept one Elizabeth Mure in place of his wife, and had by hir thr&eacute;e
sonnes, Iohn, Robert, and Alexander, with diuerse daughters, of the which one was maried
to Iohn Dunbar erle of Murrey, and another to Iohn Leon lord of Glames. The earledome

of Murrey continued in possession of the Dunbars onelie during the life of this earle Iohn &amp;
his sonne, in whom the succession failed touching the name of the Dunbars, in the inioieng
of that earledome: for leauing a daughter behind him that was married to the Dowglas,
the same Dowglas came by that means to the said earledome of Murrey. King Robert
after his coronation made sundrie earles, lords, barons, and knights. Amongst other Iames
Lindsev of Glenneske was made earle of Crawford. His wife qu&eacute;ene Eufemie deceassed the

<note place="marg">Elizabeth the Mure maried to king Robert.</note>

wife of the said Robert died, whereby they (being now both at libertie) might renew their
owne old loue, and in wedlocke possesse that which before they inioied in adulterie.]</p>
<p>Not long after, by authoritie of a parlement assembled, he made his eldest sonne Iohn,

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
also two daughters by hir.] His eldest sonne Walter, begotten on Eufemie his first wife,
was made earle of Atholl, and lord of Brechin: his second sonne Dauid, begotten on the same
Eufemie, was made earle of Stratherne. The said Walter procured the slaughter of Iames
the first, for that he pretended a right to the crowne, as after shall appeare. Shortlie

for default of such heires to Alexander his third sonne, and to his heires male; and in default of them, to remaine to his sonne Walter, begotten on Eufemie his wife, &amp; to the heires
male of his bodie begotten: and if such succession failed, then it should descend vnto his

When Archembald Dowglasse had got knowledge that the same castell was vtterlie vnprouided both of men and vittels necessarie for the defense thereof, he assembled an armie togither, with the helpe of the earles of Dowglasse and Dunbar, who ioining with
him, inuironed the castell about with a strong siege, so that no succour could enter to
the reliefe of them within at anie hand. Heerevpon the capteine sir William Fetherston
<note place="marg">Sir William Fetherston.</note>

letting them to vnderstand in what danger he stood for lacke of men and vittels. The
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan.</emph></note>
wardens wrote to him againe, that he should doo his best for eight daies to hold out; and
if no succour came within that terme, then to doo as he should s&eacute;e cause. H&eacute;ere.
vpon sir William Fetherston requiring a truce of the Scotish lords for the space of
those eight daies, within which terme if no succour came to remooue their siege, he
would y&eacute;eld the castell vnto them, the liues and goods of them within saued. This
was granted, and the Scots ceassed further to annoy them within by assalts: and when
the ninth day was come, and no aid from England appeered, they receiued the castell
into their possession, according to the couenant. And so the Scots hauing thus woone
the castell of Lochmaben, raced it quite downe to the earth.</p>

foure hundred paire of white curets, foure hundred halfe long swoords, &amp; fiftie thousand
franks, to be giuen among the nobles of Scotland, accordinglie as king Robert should appoint and thinke expedient.</p>
<p>The admerall and other the nobles of France, being thus come into Scotland to make
warres on the Englishmen, were highlie feasted by the king and lords of the realme, as then
present with him; and when the earle of Dowglasse was once come, by common consent
of them all there assembled togither in councell, it was ordeined that an armie should be
raised with all sp&eacute;ed, that ioining with these Frenchmen they might passe immediatlie into
England. The earle of Fife sonne to king Robert was appointed to be generall of this

togither, amounted to the number of fiftie thousand men, the which entring into England,
tooke the castels of Warke, Fourd, and Cornewall. After this, by robbing and spoiling the
countrie betwixt Berwike and Newcastell, they did much hurt in all parts where they came;
but through continuall raine which fell as then in great abundance, they were constreined
to returne into Scotland, where they pitched downe their field n&eacute;ere to the castell of Rockesburgh, purposing to haue assaied the winning thereof: but forsomuch as they could not
agr&eacute;e in whose name it should be kept if it were woone, they left that enterprise. For the
Frenchmen required that if they wan it, that then it might be kept by them, in the name

countrie. At length they determined to lay siege vnto Carleill, but being called from thence
they returned into Scotland, and then (as some authors write) and not before, they laid
siege to Rocksburgh, and raised from thence within eight daies after, by reason of the
variance before alledged. At Allhallowentide next insuing, the Frenchmen returned into

but big of bone, a mightie personage, vpright and tall, valiant, courteous, amiable, full of
liberalitie, merrie, faithfull, and pleasant in companie, but herewith he was of such strength,
that whome soeuer he stroke either with mace, swoord, or speare, downe he went were he

Archembald being informed, got a conuenient power of men togither, by support of his
brother in law, Robert earle of Fife, and by licence of the king passed ouer with the same,
shipped in certeine vessels into Ireland, where being got on land, he laid siege to the towne
of Carlingford. The townesmen doubting to be taken by assault, purchased a truce for
certeine daies, promising to giue a great summe of monie to haue their towne saued: but
in the meane time, they assembled the number of eight hundred men, through helpe of an
other towne not farre off, called Doundalke, and ioining with them, they diuided themselues
into two parts. One part set vpon Robert Steward of Durisdeir, who hauing the conduct
of the earle of Fifes men, was gone abroad into the countrie to fetch in some preie: and
the other part assailed William Dowglas, that lay still afore the towne.</p>

was appointed to the guiding of the earles of Dowglas and March, hauing with them Iames

of the most able men that could be found amongest all the numbers, with the which he went
to Newcastell, to trie if by anie meanes he might take the towne. There was gathered into
Newcastell before his comming thither, the most part of all the chosen men from Yorke to
the borders, with the earle of Northumberland, who by reason of extreme age was not able
to sturre abroad (anie thing to purpose) himselfe, but he had with him two of his owne
sonnes, the one named Henrie, and the other Rafe, verie forward and lustie gentlemen.

the towne towards Scotland, and viewed the towne earnestie, which way he might best come
to giue assault to win it. Henrie Persie desirous to shew some proofe of his singular manhood, wherein he greatlie trusted, required to fight with the earle of Dowglasse man to
man; which request the earle granting, togither they ran, mounted on two great coursers with

sharpe groond speares at the vtterance. The earle of Dowglasse in this incounter bare himselfe so well, that in the end he droue the Persie out of his saddle. The Englishmen that
stood without the gates, made to the rescue, recouered him on foot, and brought him foorthwith backe into the towne. Incontinentlie hervpon, the earle of Dowglasse caused the
assault to be giuen, and filling the ditches with haie and fagots, came with ladders to the
wals: but the Englishmen so well defended themselues, that the Scots were beaten backe,
not without great losse and slaughter of their people.</p>
<p>&para; Froissard making mention of this enterprise thus made by the Scots, varieth somewhat
<note place="marg"><emph>Froissard</emph> some what varieth from the Scotish writers.</note>
from the Scotish writers in this place: for he speaketh nothing that the Dowglasse and the
Persie should thus run togither on horssebacke (as before is specified) but that in giuing
assault to the towne, it chanced, that as the Englishmen defended their barriers without the
gate, the Dowglas fortuned to be matched hand to hand with Henrie Persie, and there by
force plucked the Persies staffe from him, and in returning hoisted it vp on heigth, saieng,
he would carrie the same for his sake into Scotland: and the next day after, he raised his
campe and departed homewards towards the borders, &amp; comming to a place called 
<note place="marg">Dowglas incamped at Otterborne.</note>
Otterborne, about twelue or foureteene miles from Newcastell, pitched downe his tents there,
that his souldiors might take some rest, &amp; refresh themselues after their great trauell, for
they had not rested of all the day nor night before, nor to anie purpose, since their first entering into England.</p>

<note place="marg">Henrie Persie followed the Scots.</note>
nmumber of the countrie came, and entered into the towne the same night that followed the
day of the assault. Henrie Persie then perceiuing his number sufficient to fight with Dowglasse, set them in order of battell, &amp; determined to issue foorth vpon the Scots, and to
giue them an incounter: but when he vnderstood that they were gone homewards, he followed them with all sp&eacute;ed, for he would by no means that they should passe into Scotland
without battell, trusting to recouer the dishonor which he had susteined by losing his staffe
at the barriers before the gate of Newcastell. Earle Dowglasse aduertised that the enimies
<note place="marg">The Dowglasse exhorteth his men to fight manfullie.</note>

<note place="marg">The Persie with comfortable words incourageth his men.</note>
were comming to giue him battell, exhorted his people with few words to remember their
woonted manhood, that by gaining the victorie, they might win euerlasting fame and honor,
with safegard to themselues and their countrie. The Persie likewise for his part, incouraged
his men, willing them to fight manfullie in reuenge of their iniuries doone to them and
their friends by the Scots, and herewith commanding the trumpets to sound, he gaue the
onset fiercelie.</p>
<p>Here both the armies ioining togither, a right terrible incounter insued: but because the

night was at hand, before they began to ioine, through want of light to s&eacute;e what was to

companie as attended him, come to the rescue, by whome the fight was begun afresh. Herewith also came the earle of Dowglasse, and with a great mace in his hand laid such sore
strokes round about him, that none came within his reach, but downe he went.</p>
<p>*The said Dowglasse the yoonger, hauing with him Robert &amp; Simon Glendoure, was
(all which notwithstanding) most grieuouslie wounded, whom his friends (comming about to
succor) found then cast vpon the ground, next vnto whome lay one named Hart most
miserablie wounded also. At what time a priest (which had faithfullie assisted this 
<note place="marg">This priest was William archdeacon of Aberden, as saith <emph>Io. Maior lib.</emph> 6. <emph>cap.</emph> 3. &amp; <emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 7. <emph>pa.</emph> 263. calleth him William Loundie archdeacon of saint Andrews, kinsman to Dowglasse.</note>
Dowglasse in all distresse) did (now the bodie being faint and decaied) defend the same from
other hurt of the aduersarie. Dowglasse lieng in this estate, his neere friends (Iohn Lindseie,
Iohn and Walter Seintclere) came vnto him, demanding how he did. To whome he
stoutlie answered (as one whome the presence of death nothing dismaied) that he was verie
well; for said he, I doo not now die in my bed (by sluggish destinie) but in the field, as almost
all my ancestors haue doone. Wherefore, this shall be the last thing that I will require of
you; first to keepe my death most secret, secondlie that you suffer not my standard to be
throwne downe, and lastlie that you reuenge my death; the which if I may before hand by
your promise hope to be performed, I shall with more patience indure all other things.
Wherevpon they first seuered his bodie that it should not be knowen; then they erected
his standard, crieng (as the maner is) A Dowglasse a Dowglasse. At which voice, there

was so great a concursse of people, &amp; such a ioifull assault vpon the enimie; that forthwith they draue them from the place of the battell. For at the verie name of Dowglasse,
not onelie the common people, but Iohn earle of Murrey (supposing that the same side was
in distresse) prepared in all hast to succour them.]</p>
<p>Finallie, the whole number of the Scotishmen bare themselues so manfullie, that the Englishmen being broken and put to flight, were slaine &amp; borne down. The chase continued
till the breake of the day with killing and taking, as in such cases is euer s&eacute;ene, though the
more part in d&eacute;ed were taken with their liues saued after they once fell in the chase.
Amongest other, Rafe Persie and his brother Henrie, were taken by Keith, the marshall of
Scotland, somewhat before the Englishmen began to turne. [But Lesleus. lib. 7. pa. 263.
saith that Henrie Hotspur was taken by Montgomerie, who for his ransome did build the
castle of Pounune, which his heirs to this day doo inioy. There was also taken besides
the two Persies, diuers other men of name, as Robert Ogill, Thomas Halberke, Iohn Lilborne, William Wauchlut, Robert Heron, the baron of Hilton, Iohn Colwell, and Patrike
Louell knights. There were taken in all of Englishmen, to the number of a thousand and
fortie, and slaine what in the field and chase (as Froissard recounteth) aboue an eight&eacute;ene
hundred. [But Buchan. saith, there were 1840 slaine, 1000 wounded, and 1004 taken.)
But yet the Scotish writers themselues report a lesse number. Neither did this victorie
chance to the Scots without great losse and slaughter. For amongst other, the earle of
Dowglasse himselfe was thrise stricken through the bodie, and also wounded so mortallie
on the head, that being borne to his tent a little before the end of the battell, he died of
those hurts immediatlie after, to the great discomfort of all his armie, conceiuing more
dolorous griefe for the losse of so woorthie a chiefeteine, than ioy for the gaine of a great
victorie. His bodie was conueied vnto Melros, &amp; buried beside his father earle William in
the abbeie church there. And because this earle lames had no heircs of his bodie begotten,
his coosine Archembald Dowglas lord of Galloway succ&eacute;eded him in the earldome. The
house of the Hepborns (of the which this Patrike Hepborne that fought so valiantlie in this
battell at Otterborne did descend) arose in Scotland after this wise.</p>
<p>It chanced in the daies of king Dauid the third, there was an Englishman of that name
taken prisoner in Scotland, who by chance being in place where the earle of March was got
vpon a yoong gelding vnbroken, the which plaieng the vnrulie iade, in fetching and flinging
aloft, put the earle in great danger of his life; and when all other that were present there

and estimation. This battell of Otterborne was fought on saint Oswalds day, which is the
fift of August, in the yeare 1388.</p>
<p>* Amongst those that fled to the battell, was Matthew Redman gouernor of Berwike,
whom lames Lindseie (supposing by the beautie of his armor to be of the nobler sort) did
vehementlie follow by the space of thr&eacute;e miles. At the last, Redman perceiuing that he
was not by flight able to escape (and d&eacute;eming it better to hazzard his life, than otherwise
to be slaine without aduenture) allighted from his horsse to fight with his enimie on foot,
which Lindseie did accordinglie; in the end after a long conffict betw&eacute;ene them, the Englishman (being as saith Buchanan inferior to the Scot in armor &amp; weapon) did y&eacute;eld

<note place="marg">The bishop of Durham goeth towards the Scots, accompanied with Thomas Lindseie and Thomas Clifford.</note>
himselfe to his aduersarie. By whome (after that he had giuen an oth to returne at a certeine
day) he was permitted to go at libertie. Such in those daies was the humanitie amongest
the borderers, and both nations towards their prisoners, which to this day dooth continue
betweene the inhabitants of those places. But if anie doo not returne at the day appointed,
this punishment is set vpon him for a perpetuall disgrace. That in the assemblies of true
daies (to demand restitutions of things and iniuries doone by the one nation vnto the other)
they vse that he which complaineth himselfe to be deceiued by his prisoner (on his promise)
dooth carrie about a hand or gloue painted in a cloth vpon a long staffe or speare to be s&eacute;ene
of all men; the which is accounted a singular infamie to the deseruers thereof. For they
which haue so broken their faith, be euer after hated of their friends and acquaintance; for
which dishonestie, they will not affoord them good report or interteinment. Lindseie hauing
with this condition dismissed his prisoner (and perceiuing a great number of armed men)
made directlie towards them, not knowing that they were his enimies, vntill he had ridden
so n&eacute;ere vnto them, that he could not withdraw himselfe out of their danger. These men
were the bands of the bishop of Durham, who when he came too late to Newcastell (to
ioine with Persie at the battell of Otterborne, because he supposed that the enimies woul
not ioine vntill the next day) commanded his armie to rest there, and to fall to their supper.
Shortlie after which, he tooke his iournie towards the Scots.</p>
<p>But (before he was anie great way marched out of the towne) vnderstanding (by those
that fled from Otterborne battell towards Newcastell) that Persie was ouerthrowne, and had
lost the field, he returned with his friends to Newcastell, to consult what he should doo
against the enimie. At which time it was declared, that the next day at the sunne rising,
they should all be redie in armor to s&eacute;eke the Scots. According wherevnto in the morning
of the next day, the inhabitants bordering thereabouts were assembled, who (with these that
the bishop had broght thither) were of all sorts gathered togither, to the number of 10000
horssemen and footmen. These stirred the bishops mind, that (with all sp&eacute;ed) h&eacute;e should
<note place="marg">The bishop of Durham goeth against the Scots.</note>
lead them toward the Scots, and trie the successe of battell, for the Scots (said they)
wearied with the former daies fight, and most of them wounded, will not be able to abide
the second batell. With which sp&eacute;eches they persuaded themselues of an easie conquest.
Wherevpon the bishop set forward with his armie, whose comming being vnderstood by the
scouts of the Scots, the erle of Murrey (whom now all men did follow after the death of
Dowglas) called the present nobilitie togither to consult what should be doone with the
<note place="marg"><emph>Iohn Maior</emph> writeth, that some say they tied these prisoners fast with ropes, <emph>li.</emph> 6. <emph>c.</emph> 4.</note>
prisoners, whom they could not in iustice now kill (hauing receiued them vpon ransome)
but it would seeme a most cruell part: and to rescue them (being their enimies, and almost
an equall number to themselues) it was a thing most dangerous. Wherefore it was concluded, that the prisoners should sweare, that they would not stirre whilest the Scots and
English were in fight; and further, that if the Scots were ouercome, and they (being now

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"their"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"400"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

their prisoners) recouered from them, that yet they should still remaine prisoners vnto them
as before, and so returne to them at a certeine day. These things thus doone, they left the
prisoners in the campe, with a small gard which should execute a present reuenge vpon
them, if they did at anie time s&eacute;eme to attempt anie thing.</p>
<p>After this the Scots (full of the victories latelie obteined) afresh descended into the battell,
defended behind with the marches, and on the left and right side with the dead bodies of
the former conflict: at what time it was also commanded that euerie one (as he did approch
the enimie) should blow the horne he caried about his necke (hanging at his backe) as
<note place="marg">The maner of the Scots was, that going to battell they carie a horne about their necks like hunters, and in the battel incourage themselues to fight with that, <emph>Io. Ma. li.</emph> 6. <emph>ca.</emph> 4. which I suppose was also the maner of the English (as may be by manie substantial reasons approoued.)</note>
lowd as he could, which sound being of it selfe terrible, was in the eccho (by reflexion of
the hilles) so multiplied, that it forced the enimie to suppose the Scots to be of greater number than in truth they were. But before they entred into the battell (as saith Iohn Maior)
George of Dunbar earle of March incouraged his soldiers with these words. "We haue this
night (most noble Scots) susteined the chiefe heat and force of the battell, we haue ouerthrowne the youth and strength of Northumberland with their two princes: for which there
is no cause why we (after such honor obteined against those valiant princes) should now
feare this sillie priest. Trulie there remaineth nothing now for vs, but that euerie one of
vs giue but two strokes, bicause the leader will flie at the third, and all the flocke will
follow, since the sh&eacute;epeheard stroken, the sh&eacute;epe will be dispersed. But if they shall so
long contend with vs, that (as God most rightlie forbid) we chance to be ouercome, then
shall we most shamefully loose the glorie which we before haue honorablie gained by this
nights trauell. But contrarie, if we be men, and put on vs such valiant hearts (as the
preseruation of honor requireth) we shall easilie teach this mitred priest, that it had b&eacute;ene
farre more honor to him, safetie to his, and most commoditie to them all, that he had remained at home, with rods to correct vnbrideled and negligent scholers, than with sword
to enter battell against growne and bearded souldiers."</p>
<p>This being spoken, and the English now come to the point to ioine with the aduersarie,
the Scots began the alarms with their hornes, wherevpon the English hearing that terrible
noise (vnaccustomed to them in such multitude) remembring that they must fight in the
middle of dead carcasses of their friends and kinred latelie slaine (a spectacle to discourage
most valiant hearts) and somewhat abashed at the ch&eacute;erefulnesse of the Scots standing
against them (which they looked not for after the last battell) the English (I say) considering these things, retired towards the place from whence they came, and suffered the Scots
to returne without anie other pursute against them. In the meane time, when Alexander
Lindseie (taken as before, and as yet prisoner in Newcastell) chanced to be seene and
knowne by Redman (his y&eacute;elded prisoner) he was most courteouslie (after congratulation
of amitie betw&eacute;ene them) suffred to depart fr&omacr; Newcastell to Scotland.)</p>
<p>In the y&eacute;ere following, a parlement was holden at Perth, in the which demonstration was
<note place="marg">A parlement at Perth.</note>
made by king Robert, that forsomuch as he was broken by great age, and might not
through f&eacute;eblenesse occasioned thereof attend to his office in gouernement of the realme,
it was necessarie that some gouernor shuld be chosen; wherfore he required that his second
sonne Robert earle of Fife might inioy that office, considering his eldest sonne Iohn earle of
<note place="marg">Robert earle of Fife is chosen gouernor of the realme.</note>
Carrike (by reason of a stripe which he had receiued on the leg by an horsse of sir Iames
Dowglasse of Dalketh) was not able to trauell, but kept his bed, and might sturre no way
foorth abroad. The lords consented to the kings request, and so the earle of Fife was constituted gouernour of Scotland, by common consent of all the lords of the realme [before
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
which time (as saith Buchanan) they were called wardens and not gouernors.] Also the
earle marshall of England was sent by king Richard to the borders, to remaine there as
<note place="marg">The earle marshall of England, warden of the marches.</note>

burnt the cathedrall church of Murrey, the lanterne and ornament of all the north part of
Scotland, vpon displeasure conceiued against the bishop of the same place. Whereat his
father the king tooke such indignation, that when his sonne the said Alexander was brought
to his presence, he commanded him to bee committed vnto streict prison, wherein he remained till after his fathers deceasse. The realme being in this maner brought to good
tranquillitie, king Robert falling into great infirmitie and feeblenesse, by reason of extreame

Steward the kings brother afore rehearsed, was entred into Angus with a great number of
men, and slue Walter Ogiluie shiriffe of the countrie, that came foorth with a power to resist him from spoiling the people, whom he miserablie afflicted; howbeit these his insolent dooings were not long vnpunished. For the earle of Crawford being sent against him
with an armie, caused him to disperse his companie, and to fl&eacute;e his waies; but being apprehended with the most part of his said companie, they were punished according to their demerits.</p>
<p>At this time also the most part of the north countrie of Scotland, was sore disquieted by
<note place="marg">The north parts of Scotland sore disquieted by two clans.</note>

<note place="marg">Wild Scots called Katerans.</note>

<note place="marg">A battell of thirtie against thirtie.</note>
two clans of those Irish Scots, called Katerans, which inhabit the hie.-land countries, the one
named Clankaies and the other Clanquhattans. These two being at deadlie fude, robbed
and wasted the countrie with continuall slaughter and reife. At length it was accorded
betwixt the parties, by the aduise of the earls of Murrey and Crawford, that thirtie persons
of the one clan, should fight before the king at Perth, against thirtie of the other clans
men, with sharpe swords to the vtterance, without anie kind of armor or harnesse, in triall
and decision of the quarell, for the which the variance betwixt them first arose. Both these
clans right ioifull of this appointment, came to Perth with their number, where, in a place
called the North inch, a litle beside the towne, in presence of the king and other iudges
assigned thereto, they fought according as it was agr&eacute;ed, and that with such rage and desperate furie, that all those of Clankaies part were slaine (one onelie excepted) who to saue
his life, after he saw all his fellowes slaine, lept into the water of Taie, and swam ouer, and
<note place="marg">A desperate fight.</note>
so escaped. There were 11 of Clanquhattans side that escaped with life, but not one of
them vnwounded and that verie sore. At their entring into the field or lists where they
should fight the battell, one of the clans wanted one of his number, by reason that he which
shuld haue supplied it, was priuilie stolen awaie, not willing to be partaker of so deare a
bargaine. But there was a countrie-felow among the beholders, who being sorie that so
notable a fight should be passed ouer, offered himselfe for a small summe of monie to fill
vp the number, though the matter apperteined nothing to him, nor to anie of his friends.
[This man (as saith Buchanan) s&eacute;emed to be a saddle-maker, who for halfe a

Frenchcrowne, and his diet during his life (if he were victor) tooke the matter in hand, in which
none behaued himselfe more valiantlie than he, on whose part the said eleuen did suruiue,
himselfe making vp the number.] This battell was fought thus betw&eacute;ene the two clans, in
<note place="marg"><date>1396.</date></note>
maner as is before remembred, in the yeere 1396.</p>
<p>In the third, or (as saith Buchanan) the second y&eacute;ere after, a parlement was holden at
Perth, wherin, besides diuerse constitutions and ordinances enacted for the aduancement of

the place &amp; day thus prefixed, they came redie to furnish their enterprise, and being
mounted on their mightie coursers, they ran togither right egerlie. At the first course,
though they atteinted, yet kept they their saddles without anie perill of falling. The people beholding how stiffelie earle Dauid sat without moouing, cried that the Scotishman was
locked in his saddle. He hearing this, leapt beside his horsse, and verie nimblie mounted
vp againe into the saddle, armed as he was, to the great woonder of the beholders. This
doone, he tooke another staffe, &amp; so togither they ran againe right fiercelie the second time,
and yet without anie great hurt on either part: but the third time, the lord Welles was

<p>And for bicause the earle of Crawford thus vanquished his aduersarie on saint Georges
day, h&eacute;e founded a chanterie of seuen priests to sing in our ladies church of Dund&eacute;e, in
memorie of S. George, which they did vnto our time, not without singular commendation
of the said earle. After this, he remained thr&eacute;e moneths in England, in sporting and
feasting amongst the nobles, before he returned into Scotland, highlie praised of all estates

he fell in seruice with a Scotish man named Makdonald. But at the last, being bewraied
and knowen what he was, and therevpon brought to king Robert, he was right honorablie by
him interteined: neuerthelesse, knowing himselfe deposed from his roiall estate, he gaue himselfe wholie to contemplation, till finallie he departed this world at Sterling, and was buried
in the blacke friers there within the same towne, as the same Scotish chronicles vntrulie
doo report. But to the matter, Henrie the sonne of Iohn of Gaunt, sometime duke of
Lancaster, after that king Richard was deposed, was crowned king of England at Westminster, the thirt&eacute;enth day of October, in the y&eacute;ere 1399.</p>
<p>In the y&eacute;ere next insuing, that is to say, 1400, king Robert, in consideration of a
summe of monie to him aforehand paid, contracted couenants of mariage to be had
and made betwixt his sonne the duke of Rothsaie, and the earle of Marches daughter. But Archembald earle of Dowglas, hauing indignation that the earle of March
<note place="marg">The occasion of the falling out betwixt king Robert and the earle of March.</note>
should be preferred before him, by support of the duke of Albanie, procured a councell
to be called, in the which he found meanes to assure his daughter the ladie Margerie,
or Marie (as saith Buchanan) vnto the said duke of Rothsaie, &amp; with all sp&eacute;ed went
about to consummate the mariage betwixt them, to put the matter out of all doubt.
The earle of March perceiuing this dealing, came to the king, and required to know
his pleasure, if he minded to performe the couenants concluded, concerning the mariage
betwixt the prince and his daughter, or not; making as it were a great complaint of
that which was alreadie doone to the breach thereof; and receiuing answer nothing
agreeable to his mind, he departed in a great fume, not sticking to say, he would be
reuenged on such vntruth yer it were long. Shortlie after he fled into England, leauing

this Robert Maitland obeied the kings commandement, and deliuered the house to the
<note place="marg">The castell of Dunbar seized to the kings vse.</note>
said Dowglasse.</p>
<p>George earle of March informed h&eacute;ereof, procured all his friends to conueie themselues into England, and determined with himselfe to doo all the displeasure and mischiefe he might inuent against his owne natiue countrie. King Robert sore dreading,
least by this earles procurement some trouble might hap to follow amongest his subiects
[did (first confiscating his goods) send] an herald at armes into England with letters
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
vnto him, promising by the tenure of the same, not onelie to pardon him of all 
<note place="marg">King Robert writeth vnto the earle of March.</note>
offenses committed, but also to redresse all wrongs or iniuries which he had anie waies
foorth receiued, if he would returne into Scotland. And forsomuch as the earle of
March refused this offer, the same herald according to instructions giuen him at his
departure from king Robert, went immediatlie to Henrie king of England with other
<note place="marg">Sent letters also vnto the king of England.</note>
letters, earnestlie desiring him to cause the earle of March to depart out of his realme,
&amp; not to receiue anie rebels out of Scotland into his bounds, whereby the peace might
be violated, which as yet remained betwixt the two kingdomes.</p>
<p>King Henrie vpon reasonable allegations (as he pretended) refused to satisfie king
Roberts petitions in this behalfe, by reason whereof the peace brake betwixt them
and their subiects, without anie further tracting of time. For shortlie after, Henrie
<note place="marg">Henrie Hotspur and the earle of March enter into Scotland.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
Persie, surnamed (as is said) Henrie Hotspur, and the earle of March entered into Scotland, and got togither a great bootie of goods and cattell [in Louthian about Hadington,
at what time they did in vaine besiege the castell of Hais or Halis, who being at Lintone were come vpon by the Scots, for (to haue returne of the booties taken) Archembald earle of Dowglasse] hauing assembled a power of men, came with the same towards the enimies, immediatlie wherevpon they fled to Berwike, and left all their bootie
behind them, which being recouered by the said earle of Dowglasse and his companie,
he returned backe vnto Edenburgh, where he shortlie after being taken with an hot feuer departed out of this life, leauing behind him an honorable memorie of his name,
<note place="marg">The deceasse of Archembald earle of Dowglasse.</note>
for his high prowesse and noble valiancie shewed in manie and sundrie enterprises, by

<p>After his deceasse, his second sonne that was called likewise Archembald, was made
earle of Dowglasse; for his eldest sonne William Dowglasse died in the y&eacute;ere before
his father. Shortlie after, Henrie king of England came into Scotland with an armie,
<note place="marg">Henrie king of England inuadeth Scotland.</note>
without dooing anie great damage to the people; for he required no more of them that
kept anie castels or strengths, but onelie to put foorth a banner of his armes as he
passed by. At his comming to Hadington, he was lodged in the nunrie there, &amp; shewed much bounteous humanitie toward the nuns, and all other of that house, not suffering anie manner of thing to be doone preiudiciall to the same. The like gentlenesse he vsed towards them of the Holie rood house, at his comming to Edenburgh,
wherein he likewise lodged. It is thought, that in memorie of the friendlie interteinement, which his father the duke of Lancaster found in these abbeies, at the time of
his being in Scotland, when the rebellion chanced in England, through Iacke Straw
and his complices, he shewed such fauour towards them at this present. To be briefe,
it should app&eacute;ere, that king Henrie came into Scotland, as it were inforced, more thorough counsell of his nobles, than for anie hatred he bare towards the Scots, as he
well shewed in returning backe againe, without dooing them anie further iniurie.</p>

manner in vnbrideled lust, beyond the bounds of all measure, to the great reproch of them
both, wrote to his brother the duke of Albanie, requiring him to take his sonne, the
said duke of Rothsaie into his custodie, and to s&eacute;e him so chastised for his wanton behauiour, as he might learne to amend the same. &para; Here is to be noted, that the duke of
Albanie had of long time before, desired to s&eacute;e the duke of Rothsaie dispatched out of
the way, as the person whome he most doubted; &amp; therefore hauing commission thus
from the king to take him, he reioised not a little, trusting thereby to compasse his
purpose without danger. And h&eacute;erevpon taking the duke of Rothsaie betwixt Dund&eacute;e
&amp; saint Andrewes, he brought him to Falkeland, where he shut him vp in streict 
<note place="marg">The duke of Rothsaie committed to prison.</note>
prison, and kept him without all manner of meat or drinke, so to famish him to death.</p>
<p>It is said, that a woman vnderstanding the duke of Albanies intention, and taking ruth
of the others pitifull case, found meanes to let meale fall downe thorough a rift of the
loft of that tower wherein he was inclosed, by meanes whereof his life was certeine
dales susteined; but after this was once knowen, incontinentlie was the woman made
awaie. On the same manner, an other woman through a long reed fed with milke
of hir owne brests, and was likewise dispatched as soone as hir dooings were perceiued.
Then after this, the duke destitute of all worldlie sustenance, thorough very famine was
<note place="marg">The duke of Rothsaie famished to death.</note>
constreined to eat not onelie all such filth as he could find within the tower, but also
in the end he gnawed off his owne fingers, and so finallie in this miserable state of martyrdome (as I may call it) ended his wretched life, and was buried in Lundoris, where (as
the fame went) manie faire miracles were doone n&eacute;ere to his graue, till time that

of that countrie should euerie one of them for his turne, with a competent number for
the time, make a rode into England, to reuenge such displeasures. The first that went,
was Thomas Haliburton of Dirlington, who returned in safetie with a great preie taken of
Englishmens goods. Next vnto him was Patrike Hepborne of the Halis the yoonger, appointed to go foorth as capteine generall with a certeine number, who entering into

incountered with him at Nesbet in the Mers, and there not onelie slue him, but also

distressed his people. Besides them that were slaine with their capteine, there were also manie that were taken, as Iohn and William Cockborne, Robert Lawder of the Bas, Iohn and

they got no great aduantage; yet at length he fell to this composition with them, that if he
had no rescue within the space of thr&eacute;e moneths [or (as Buchanan saith) fiftie daies] the
castell should be then rendered into their hands. When the gouernour of Scotland was
informed what agreement the capteine of Cockclauis had made, he assembled the lords in
counsell to haue their aduise for the leauieng of an armie against the time appointed.
There were manie of this opinion, that it was better to lose the castell, than to ieopard
the liues of so manie men as were necessarie to furnish that enterprise for the sauing of
it. But the gouernour shewed, that he weied the losse of it so much, that if none
of the nobles would passe with him to the rescue thereof, yet he would go himselfe
to doo what in him might lie to saue it. But in the meane time, such trouble rose in
England, that there n&eacute;eded no power to be leauied for the defense of Cockclauis. For

victorie, and slue the lord Persie, surnamed (as before ye haue heard) Henrie Hotspur.
At this battell was also the earle of Dowglas, with a great companie of Scotishmen on
the Persies side, for being taken prisoner at the battell of Homildon (as before is said) it
was accorded betwixt him and the said Henrie Hotspur, that aiding him &amp; other his complices against king Henrie, if it chanced the said king Henrie to be vanquished and put
from the crowne, according to their intent and purpose, then should the said earle Dowglas be released of his ransome, and haue the towne of Berwike rendered vnto him in
reward of his aid and assistance. He fought (as is reported) with singular manhood,

<note place="marg">He is taken prisoner.</note>
and had the fore ward on the Persies side. He slue that day with his owne hands, thr&eacute;e
gentlemen arraied in the kings cote armour; and finallie when the battell was lost, he was
taken in the chase, and saued aliue, where not one more of all his retinue of Scots escaped
with life, but were all slaine out of hand. Neither was this victorie gotten by king Henrie,
without great slaughter of those that were on his part, for he lost foure verie valiancie
knights, as Staluart, Blunt, Massie, and Pottoke, with seuen hundred other souldiers and
men of war (as the Scotish writers haue) but the English authors name a farre greater number, as sixt&eacute;ene hundred at the least.</p>
<p>King Henrie (as the same Scotish writers doo record) vsed the counsell &amp; aduise of the
earle of March, in the obteining of this victorie, being fled latelie before from the rebels
side to him. The earle of Dowglas, in respect of his noble parentage and high valiancie, was verie tenderlie cherished by king Henrie, who for that he had s&eacute;ene him doo so valiantlie in the day of that battell, reputed him woorthie of all honor. The earle of

great manhood. At the battell of Hommildon he lost one of his eies, and at this battell
of Shrewesburie he lost one of his stones. The old earle of Northumberland, hearing

<p>About the same time, king Robert was aduertised, that his sonne the duke of Rothsaie was

<note place="marg">The duke of Albanie excuseth himselfe.</note>
pined to death in Falkland (in manner as before is expressed) which newes were so gr&eacute;euous vnto him, that he grew each day more and more in sorow and melancholie. The duke
of Albanie kept it so long as was possible from the kings knowledge, and being now sent
for by the king to answer him for such treasonable slaughter of his sonne, he came, and
so excused the matter with a faire painted tale, as though he had b&eacute;ene nothing guiltie in
the cause, and for further declaration of his innocencie, he promised (if it might please the
king to come vnto Edenburgh) he would bring in the offendors which were culpable of the
murther. The king as then remaining in Bute (where for the most part he euer soiourned)
though he were not well able to trauell by reason of long sicknesse, yet in a chariot he came
vnto Edenburgh, vpon the earnest desire he had to see his sons death punished. And at
<note place="marg">The king commeth to Edenburgh.</note>
his comming thither, the duke of Albanie deliuered vnto him certeine naughtie persons,
&amp; such in d&eacute;ed, as for their heinous acts and vngratious conditions deserued well to die
(though not for this matter) which neuerthelesse by vntrue suggestions and forged accusements, being brought before corrupt iudges (and such as the duke of Albanie had 
<note place="marg">Giltlesse persons condemned.</note>
prouided for his purpose) were condemned as giltie of his death, whome in all their life time
they neuer saw.</p>
<p>Though this matter was handled as finelie as was possible, and made so sound and cleare
as could be deuised; yet was not the king so satisfied in his mind, but that he had a great
suspicion in the duke of Albanie as author of his sonnes death: but for somuch as the duke
<note place="marg">The suspicion of the king towards the duke of Albanie.</note>
had all the realme vnder his obeisance, partlie by policie, and partlie by authoritie of his office, being gouernor thereof, the king durst not attempt anie thing against him, but rather
doubted, least he hauing an ambitious desire to the crowne, would compasse also to haue
the life of his second sonne (named Iames) as then prince of Scotland; and therefore by
the faithfull helpe &amp; good aduise of Walter Wardlaw the bishop of saint Andrews, he prouided a ship, and sent the said prince foorth in the same to passe into France to K. Charls
<note place="marg">The king sendeth away his sonne the prince.</note>

came to Flamburgh head, where (as some say) they were taken on the sea by Englishmen,
the which hearing how the prince of Scotland should passe that waies, laie in wait for him.
Others write, that his desire was to be set on land there, because he might not awaie
with the aire of the sea, being brought far out of quiet in his head &amp; stomach therewith. But

Scotland as his lawfull prisoner, for that he was thus taken in time of warres, and that moreouer, there were diuers rebels of England succored within the bounds of his fathers dominion, to the high displeasure of the said king Henrie. But such was the fauour shewed in
his bringing vp, that his captiuitie turned more to his honor, profit, and commoditie, than
anie other worldlie hap that might by anie means haue otherwise chanced vnto him. He had
such perfect instructors to teach him, aswell the vnderstanding of toongs as the sciences, that
he became right expert and cunning in euerie of them. He was taught also to ride, to run
at the tilt, and handle all kind of weapons conuenientlie to be vsed of such a personage,
wherevnto he was so apt and readie, that few in anie point of actiuitie might ouermatch him.
He had good knowledge in musike, and could plaie on sundrie instruments right perfectlie.
To be briefe, it appeered in all his behauiour and maners, in what companie so euer he came,
that his bringing vp had b&eacute;ene according to his nature, neither of them differing from his

with his wife queene Annabell before rehearsed. He was a man of a mightie stature, verie
<note place="marg">His stature and qualities.</note>
liberall and gentle, so that if he had not b&eacute;ene maimed with a horsse, and thereby grew
lame, that he might trauell about the affaires of the realme himselfe, it was thought the
common-wealth should haue prospered vnder his gouernement, as much as euer it did
vnder anie of his predecessors.</p>
<p>The gouernor Robert duke of Albanie, after the deceasse of his brother king Robert, was
<note place="marg">The duke of Albanie confirmed gouernor of the realme.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
by new election chosen, or rather confirmed in his office of gouernor, which he exercised
more vprightlie, &amp; with better iustice now after his brothers death, than before. [For (as
saith Buchanan) take away from him, that he was ouermuch blinded with desire to gouerne (wherevnto he cared not by anie means to aspire) there were in him manie other
good parts woorthie to haue such gouernement: for he was valiant in battell, wise in counsell, he did decide matters of controuersie with great equitie, he wan the nobilitie with his
liberalitie, and did not sucke the commons drie by exactions.] In the meane time, the
castell of Jedworth (which the Englishmen had held euer since the battell of Durham) was
<note place="marg">Jedworth castell taken.</note>

<note place="marg">The earle of Dowglasse is released and returneth into Scotland.</note>
taken by Tiuidalemen, and raced downe to the earth. Archembald earle of Dowglasse, as
yet remaining captiue in England, after he had knowledge of king Roberts death, made
shift to agr&eacute;e for his ransome, and so being set at libertie, returned with all sp&eacute;ed now at
length into Scotland.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, there was a councell called, wherein was a motion made for the restoring of
<note place="marg">A motion made for the restoring of the earle of March to his countrie.</note>

<note place="marg">The earle of March restored home.</note>
George earle of March to his countrie, lands, and bloud. After long debating of the
matter, and hard hold to and fro both with him and against him, it was in the end concluded, that he should returne into Scotland, and be receiued as a true Scotishman; but
vnder this condition, that he should forgo his lands of Annerdale, and Lochmaben, which
should for euer remaine to the Dowglasse, and to his heires. All his other lands and possessions, it was accorded, that he should inioy as in his former right &amp; estate. And thus
was the earle of March pardoned of all passed offenses committed against the crowne of
Scotland, and returned home, to the great comfort of his friends. * Persie that before

<note place="marg"><date>1409.</date></note>
was fled into Scotland to the erle of March his old friend, was courteouslie receiued, interteined, &amp; nourished according to his estate, by the said earle of March: during which time,
he sollicited his friends in England to find means for returne into his countrie. And
amongst other of his friends, with whom he dealt by secret messengers; he directed letters
concerning the same, to an old (and as he d&eacute;emed a most faithfull) friend of his, called
Rafe Roksbie, declaring vnto him that he should not want friends, both Scotish &amp; English
(through whose helpe he did not despaire to recouer his patrimonie) if he might haue his
aid also therein, for this Rafe was shiriffe of Yorkshire. This man, after he had intised
Persie (vnder the assurance of false hope and trust in him) to come into England, he
opened the conspiracie to the king, and secretlie laid wait to intercept the said earle, by
which meanes, (getting him into his possession) he cut off his head, and sent it to the king
to London. At which time also, there was an Englishman in Scotland, which called himselfe Richard the second: but falslie (as I suppose) saith Buchanan; for when the elder
Persie did often and importunatlie require to talke with him, he could neuer be persuaded
by anie mens words to come, or enter sp&eacute;ech to, or with the said earle of Northumberland,
fearing (belike) least his deceipt would be vnderstood by him, which knew his owne and
true king verie well. This counterfeit king yet boasting him to be of the princelie bloud,
was honored accordinglie; after certeine yeares, and at length (feining himselfe to be far
from all desire of gouernement, to the end he might woorke his effect the more safelie) he
died and was baried in the church of the frier Dominicks in Sterling, with a title of the
king of England grauen vpon him.)</p>
<p>About the same time, there rose great trouble in Scotland, by the rebellion of Donald of
<note place="marg">Rebellion moued by Donald of the Iles.</note>
the Iles, who claming by right of his wife, a title to the earldome of Rosse, was defeated

by way of supplication, besought the gouernor to doo him reason; but he receiued nought,
except it were froward sp&eacute;ech, wharewith he tooke such displeasure, that raising all the

power of the Iles he came into Rosse, and subdued the same at his pleasure. *The which
to make the matter more plaine, and to deduce his title out of Lesleus (which he forgetteth
not to report for the honor of his owne house) I will set the same downe in this maner. Walter
Lesle a noble man, after singular prowesse shewed by him (in externall battell) vnder the
Romans, returned with honor into Scotland, where he maried the daughter of William
earle of Rosse, (slaine at the battell of Halidon) and with hir obteined the earldome of
that prouince, of which wife he raised one sonne called Alexander, after earle of Rosse;
and one daughter giuen in mariage to Donald of the Iles. This Alexander ioined himselfe
<note place="marg">The earldome of Rosse transferred from the line of Walter Rosse to the Stewards.</note>
in mariage with Eufemie the daughter of Robert the gouernor, and had by hir one onelie
daughter and heire christened after the name of hir mother, who (after the death of hir
father, being yet a tender maid and vnpractised in the course of things) was partlie by the
flatteries, and partlie by the threats of the gouernor, induced to giue the earldome of Rosse
vnto him, by whose helpe, as it was reported, she shortlie after died. Wherevpon, Donald that
had to wife the sister of Alexander Lesle (aunt to this Eufemie which sold hir inheritance)
demanding the erldome of Rosse by right of inheritance (as is said) by his wife, entered
Rosse, and brought it to his subiection.) But not being satisfied with this, he passed
through Murrey, Boghtuall, and other bounds thereabouts, till he came vnto Garioch, purposing to burne Aberden.</p>
<p>But Alexander Steward earle of Mar, hauing gathered a power with all diligence to resist

fiercelie than discr&eacute;etlie, not passing for keeping anie accustomed arraie of battell, as had
b&eacute;ene requisit. By reason whereof, great slaughter was made on either part, the victorie

and diuers other gentlemen, with commons, to the number of six hundred. This battell
was striken on saint Iames euen, in the yeare 1411. Donald of the Iles, after this bickering

after the battell of Harlow, Patrike Dunbar, second sonne to the earle of March, with one

and being all the time of his gouernement busied in the warres of France, the English
ceassed to offer iniuries to the Scots: or for that the gouernor of the Scots durst not mooue
anie thing against the English, fearing least the K. of England would then retume home the
right and true heire of Scotland, who (he was most assured should find fauour against him)
in the hearts of his owne people, that would tenderlie pitie the misfortune of his imprisonment, and seeke to establish him in the kingdome. Wherefore if there were anie thing
doone in that meane time, they were but some few and small excursions within the realme,
which more aptlie might be called robberies &amp; spoiles, than anie right wars. For as Pennure in England was burned by Archembald Dowglas, so (to answer the same) Dunfreis
in Scotland was in the like order destroied by the English. Besides which there was a
certeine exchange of prisoners of the one nation with the other: for Mordac the sonne of
the gouernor (taken at Halidon) was returned into Scotland, and Persie (who was brought
out of England by his grandfather into Scotland, and left vnder the protection of the gouernor) was deliuered to the English, and after by the new king of England was restored
to the title &amp; lands of his ancestors earles of Northumberland.</p>
<p>This man (though by the lawes of armes he was no captiue) yet the vniust deteining of
lames the sonne of the king of Scots stopped the mouths of the English, that they could
not complaine of anie iniurie doone in deteining him. The dooing whereof so litle offended
this Persie, that while he liued, he did (with all kind of courtesie) giue witnes of the
humanitie shewed vnto him by the Scots. Not much different from this time, came two
ambassadors into Scotland, the one from the councell of Constance (wherof the chiefe
was the abbat of Pontineac) and the other was from Peter de Luna, who did stiflie reteine
and defend the papasie, whereof he had once gotten possession, which Peter by the trauell
and persuasion of Henrie Hardine (an English man, and a Franciscane frier) had drawne
the gouernor of Scotland to follow his faction, which yet succ&eacute;eded to none effect: bicause
the vniuersall companie of the cleargie stiffelie labored against it, and did subscribe to the
deposition of Peter, and to the councell of Constance for the election of Martine the fift to
the papasie.</p>
<p>Much what about the same time, Iohn Drummond slue Patrike Graham earle of

Shortlie after also, there rose great warres betwixt England and France, as in the histories of
<note place="marg">Warres betwixt England and France.</note>

<note place="marg">Rebellion in Wales.</note>
those realmes may more plainlie appeare. There was also a great rebellion raised in Wales,
against Henrie the fift king of England, which was the son of Henrie the fourth latelie deceassed. &para; We find in the Scotish chronicles, that this Henrie the fift, at his returning
foorth of France, after his first iournie thither (hauing in the same woone the towne of
Harfl&eacute;et, &amp; discomfited the whole power of France at Agincourt) was constreined to go
against the Welshmen, and incountering with the prince of Wales, was discomfited, and

Wales, not ceassing till he had brought the Welshmen subiect at his pleasure: but the English writers make no mention of anie such matter.</p>

Vandosme, and chancellor of France, both to renew the ancient league betwixt the two realmes

armie, &amp; that in all hast. Which rumor being spred ouer all the bounds of his realme,
caused the Scots for doubt thereof to lie all the next summer on the borders: but in the

descend vnto king Henrie, as lawfull inheritor vnto that realme, without all contradiction;
by reason whereof, Charles the Dolphin, and sonne to the said king Charles, was clearelie

Swinton knights, accompanied with seuen thousand well armed men, arriued in France, to
the great reioising of the Dolphin, as he well declared in the thankfull receiuing, and most

<note place="marg">The battell of Bauge.</note>
(thinking that the duke in that holie feast would, as the maner was, cease from all violence
of warre, and attend the church ceremonies appointed for those times; or else as some
write, by reason of the truce which was taken for eight daies) did more negligentlie looke
vnto their estate than wisdome would they shuld haue doone. The which when Clarence
vnderstood (either by Andrew Fregose an Italian, or by the Scotish forragers intercepted by
his horssemen) he reioised that he had so good occasion offered woorthilie to performe
something. Wherefore rising foorthwith from dinner, he commanded his horssemen to
arme themselues, with whome he went directlie towards his enimies, at what time he was
(besides the beautie of his other furniture) richlie adorned with goodlie diadems of gold (set

whom was Iohn de la Croix) being feared, made their defense in flight; and for safegard
entered the st&eacute;eple of the next church adioining, in the which they were hardlie after besieged.</p>
<p>Whilest these were thus inuironed, the clamor and cries which was now come to the next
armie (wherein the Scots were assembled) suddenlie caused them with great feare to fl&eacute;e to their
weapons. At that time the erle of Buchquhane (whilest the others prepared themselues)

sent thirtie archers to possesse the bridge vnder which the next riuer had his course, and
through which they might passe ouer, where (incountering with the English enimie) Hugh
Kennedie came vnto them out of the next church (in which he soiorned) with a hundred
of his companie halfe armed, as it often falleth out in such sudden exploits. These with their
arrowes so streictlie kept this streict, that the horssemen could not haue anie passage there,
for which cause the duke of Clarence did first forsake horsse (as the rest of the companie
did after him) began the battell on foot, and with a strong assault made way for his men,
beating from them the Scots, who were for the most part vnarmed, and the others not verie
well armed.</p>
<p>After this, in the meane time whilest Clarence taketh his horsse againe, and some of the
rest scatteringlie doo passe the bridge, the earle of Buchquhane commeth vpon them, &amp;

Frenchmen laid vpon them, obiecting that the gr&eacute;edinesse of wine &amp; vittels had brought
them ouer into that countrie. With which reproch the Frenchmen are woont to vpbraid
the English, the Spaniard the French, and the Affrican the Spaniard. But as the Scots
were eger in a strange countrie to win honor, so was the English no lesse desirous of conquest, greatlie disdeining both at home and abroad, to be so infested with that implacable
nature of the Scots. In which battell none did fight more valiantlie or egerlie than did the
duke of Clarence himselfe. Against whome (so noted for the richnesse of his armor) came
Iohn Swinton, which greeuouslie wounded him in the face, and whome the earle of Buchquhane (striking on the head with his mace) quite ouerthrew to the ground. Which doone,

called the earle of Angus, &amp; the lord Greie were part: but of the Scots and Frenchmen,
there were few missing, and they of the meaner sort. All which, as we haue h&eacute;ere set it
downe, is the common report of the death of the duke of Clarence. But the booke of
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 10.</note>
Pluscart reporteth, that the duke was slaine by Alexander Macelsell, a knight of Lenox,
which tooke from him the coronet (whereof we spake before) and sold the same to Iohn
Steward of Dernill, for a thousand angels, which he after laied to pawne to Robert Hustone,
to whom he owght fiue thousand angels; &amp; this saith that booke was the most common
report at those daies. The chiefe praise of which victorie remained with the Scots, euen
by the testimonie of the enuious aduersaries, as the writer of this storie saith vpon his
credit.) At this battell also were a great companie of prisoners taken, amongest whome (as
<note place="marg">Prisoners taken.</note>
principall) were these, the earle of Huntington, &amp; the earle of Summerset, with his brother,
both of them being brethren to the ladie Iane, that was after maried to king Iames the first,
king of Scotland. For the high valiancie of the Scotishmen shewed in this battell, the
Dolphin created the earle of Buchquhane high constable of France, and gaue him sundrie

<p>* King Henrie hearing of the death of his brother the duke of Clarence, did substitute
for his deputie his other brother the duke of Bedford, promising that he would shortlie
after come thither himselfe with an armie of foure thousand horsse, and a thousand footmen
(which he performed accordinglie.) For with all sp&eacute;ed he after came into France with a

with the Dolphin to forsake him, and to returne home into their owne countrie: but when
he had broken this matter vnto the said Iames, and promised, that if he could bring it to
passe, he would not onelie remit his ransome, but also send him into Scotland highlie rewarded with great riches: Iames answered h&eacute;erevnto, that he maruelled much, why he did

and as yet had not receiued the crowne, "but (saith he) if it were so that I might be set
at libertie, and had receiued the crowne according to the accustomed manner, togither with
the othes and homages of my subiects, I could then in this matter doo as should be thought

that yoong prince, left off to trauell with him anie further in this matter. In the meane
time, the warres continuing betwixt the king of England and the Dolphin of France, manie
townes were bes&eacute;eged, woone, and sacked, and sundrie light bickerings and skirmishes
chanced betwixt the parties, as occasion serued. But the Englishmen shewed themselues

against their enimies, being of an other nation. [For king Henrie, when he had taken the
towne of Meldens, hanged twentie Scots which he found therein, laieng to their charge that
they had fought against their owne king.] At length, king Henrie fell into a gr&eacute;euous disease, which in short time made an end of his life, notwithstanding all the helpe that either

Iames the first out of captiuitie, till at length he brought him home in d&eacute;ed, to the great
wealth, ioy, and good hap of all the Scotish nation. * For calling togither a parlement
(of the nobilitie) at Perth, they consulted of receiuing home their Iames imprisoned in
England, and at length willinglie agr&eacute;ed (either for fauour they bare to the lawfull heire,
or being wearied with the lothsomnes of the present gouernement) to send an ambassage
to the king of England; to demand the restitution of king Iames. Wherevpon they dispatched into England (to execute their deuise) Henrie Lichton bishop of Aberden, Archembald Dowglasse (the third earle of that name, and fift of that familie) the sonne of

the title of the dukedome of Touraine. But that glorie of the Scots was soone diminished
(as saith Lesleus) by the infortunat successe which they had through the English at the
battell of Vernoile. In which (besides all the hired or common souldiers which were also
most slaine at that time) there perished of the nobilitie, the two brethren of the gouernour,
the earle of Buchquhane constable of France, Archembald Dowglas duke of Touraine, with
Iames his sonne and heire, Alexander Lindseie, Thomas Swinton, Robert Steward, and
manie other, as in the French and English histories more largelie may app&eacute;ere.</p>
<p>And h&eacute;ere a little to step out of the way, because in this place Buchanan girdeth at the
<note place="marg">A digression against Buchanan.</note>
English (as he dooth in all the parts of his booke, with most bitter tawnts) I will a little
shew that he hath forgotten himselfe in the same: as well against vs generallie (as app&eacute;ereth
in manie places) as against Grafton, Humfrie Lhoid, and Hall, especiallie in manie other
places thereof. And therefore (readers) giue me leaue in milder sort to speake of him
(being dead) than he dooth of others. For although (against all humanitie) he doo most
bitterlie with woords of heat inflame his pen against Humfrie Lhoid, departed the world
manie yeeres (as it app&eacute;ereth) before he tooke the later penne in hand (after the ouerseeing
of his old fragments) as himselfe in his epistle confesseth, to write an historie: yet I will
spare him in better sort. And therefore I much muse, that he a man so learned and graue,
would now in his later age, when reason should most rule him, so dip his pen in gall,
as forgetting himselfe, he should be of these rough conditions (contrarie to all learning,
which <emph>Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros</emph>) he would call men impudent, immodest, vnlearned, liers, vnbrideled, malicious, backbiters, euill toonged; and that he can rather
prooue the Britains to be made of dogs and brute beasts, better than to be descended of
Brutus. All which speeches are to be found in his booke: for (if there were a fault in
Lhoid) as there was none, because it s&eacute;emes he did not well conceiue his mind: could not
he either reprehend error, or disprooue men, but with such bitter tawnts, when they but

<!--<fw place="top-left">"416"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

onelie shew their opinion, dissenting in orderlie sort from others, as it is lawfull for all
learned men to doo? Where learned he that rhetorike, to reiect the opinion of men with
dogs eloquence, and sooner to deduce that creature (formed to the image of God, and
lord of all beasts) to be rather made of dogs than of men, and for one or two priuat persons
to inueie against a whole state?</p>
<p>But Humfrie Lhoid imputeth a note of infamie to his nation (as he supposed) in disproouing Hector Boetius, who arrogantlie (beside all truth) bath transferred to his Scots,
both places, persons, and d&eacute;eds, which heuer belonged to them. And is this so great a
fault in Lhoid, when himselfe and Lesleus bishop of Rosse (secretlie misliking Boetius)
haue in silence passed ouer a great manie imperfections in the historie of Boetius, and placed
manie other things after an other sort, referring them to other times than Boetius dooth?
And why should he maligne Lhoid for reprehending him, whome himselfe condemneth, &amp;
of whome he saith that <emph>In descriptione Scoti&oelig; qu&oelig;dam par&ugrave;m ver&egrave; prodidit, &amp; alios in
errorem induxit,</emph> and whome for manie faults (by Boetius escaped) he further saith in the
later end of his second booke, that he will not defend him in such errors, as no reason
there is why he should? But if from the abundance of the hart the toong and hand doo
speake and write, I can not see but that by his distemperat sp&eacute;eches, I must condemne him
of secret grudge, not so much to the person of Lhoid, as to the whole nation, against which
the chiefest part of his booke s&eacute;emeth to be a stomaching inuectiue. And yet such as it
is, they must of necessitie follow that intreat of the historie of his nation, or else he will
exclame against them (as he dooth in this place of the battell of Vernoile) that they maliciouslie obscure the glorie of the Scots, following the authoritie of the aduersarie, and not
the truth of the historie written by him, or the French nation.</p>
<p>And in this place of his booke, rather than he will want occasion to tawnt and disgrace vs
by his cholerike pen, he will s&eacute;eke a knot in a rush, and make a mounteine of a molehill,
in so vehement inuaieng against the English, that say that the Scots were not able to mainteine such titles of honor as were giuen them by the French: a simple matter to make such
discourse vpon, and to step so much awrie out of the course of the storie. But thinke you
Buchanan hath committed no such (nay greater) faults against vs? Yes trulie, and that
I suppose will be well prooued at an other time, in an other treatise vpon his booke now
iustlie forbidden in England, and (as I heare) more iustlie in Scotland. And heere remember I praie th&eacute;e gentle reader, that in one place of his booke he saith that he ment to
haue obserued this course from the beginning, that he would not s&eacute;eke to digresse by
bypaths out of the course of the historie. And hath he so soone forgotten that in the first
forehead of his booke, almost thr&eacute;e leaues togither, &amp; also in manie other parts of the same
(as well as in this place of the battell of Vernoile) he hath lept manie miles out of the way,
with bitter woords to tawnt Humfrie Lhoid, Grafton, Hall, &amp; all the English histories, and
by manie whole pages (in manie parts of his woorke) with much spence of powder and
shot, to batter the credit of the English writers. These trulie were not parts of such a
person, as the place (which he had about the prince whilest he liued) required. But
inough of this by me (who am not <emph>Honorarius arbiter,</emph> and will be no seuere censurer of
other mens writings at this time (wherevnto I was occasioned by Buchanans digression in
this place) since the same will be more substantiallie touched by others in other woork

rose great strife and contention betwixt the constable &amp; the duke of Touraine, who should
haue the supreme rule of the Scotish legher, the one disdaining to giue place to the other.
Thus ye may perceiue, how the Scots with losse of manie of their liues, and much bloudshed, supported the side of Charles king of France, against the Englishmen. And though

there came dailie newes of diuerse great ouerthrowes giuen by the Englishmen to such
Scotishmen and other, as serued the said king Charles, yet did not the Scots therefore staie
at home, but at sundrie times, and vnder sundrie capteins repaired into France: as amongest

Charles the seuenth aforesaid, shewing such proofe of his singular manhood and valiancie

seruice stood king Charles in notable st&eacute;ed. Chieflie his diligence and prowesse well app&eacute;ered, in reducing the parties of Gascoigne vnto the French subiection, which had remained
a great number of y&eacute;eres vnder the dominion of the English kings. And heerevpon was

time. We say, that the French reioising of this conquest of Gascoigne, would not s&eacute;eme
to be vnthankfull to the Scots therefore: for which cause they erected a statue or image of
this Patillocke, in the hall of the king of France, as a perpetuall memorie of this conquest,
and as a singular testimonie of their good will towards the Scots, which they placed there
to remaine a monument to all posteritie. Beside which, he confirmed and increased the
number of the gard of Scotish archers (which they were woont to vse in peace and warre)
first instituted by Charles the king of France, ouer all which he made this Patillocke chiefe
capteine, which office the Scots did then and since so well discharge, that the same continueth yet in our memorie. Besides which (a little before this) Charles the sixt appointed

an other companie of Scotish horssemen to be in wages with him, being commonlie called
the trap of the Scotishmen at armes. Of whome the chiefe gouernour was Robert Steward
(borne of the familie of the earle of Lennox) who was honored by the king with the title
of the lord de Aubignie, with other lands and great possessions bestowed vpon him. All
which (being of long time possessed of the Scots of the same surname, by continuall order
of bloud &amp; descent, that is, by Bernard the famous capteine of warre, then by Robert, and
to conclude, by Iohn Steward, brother of the earle of Lennox) is at this day also in possession of the woorthie yoong gentleman (the sonne of the said Iohn) who giueth foorth a
rare hope that he will not degenerat from the nobilitie of his ancestors. The ambassadors

sent (as before is shewed) into England for K. Iames, behaued themselues so sagelie therein,
that in the end, they brought it to good conclusion: as thus. First it was agr&eacute;ed, that
king Iames should be set at libertie, and also pay for his ransome the sum of 100000 marks
<note place="marg">The ransome of K. Iames.</note>

behind him, till it were paid. Albeit some writers alledge, that leauing pledges for the
paiment of the one halfe, he was discharged of the other, in consideration that he tooke to
wife the ladie Iane, daughter to the earle of Summerset. The said earle and the cardinall

<p>On the morrow after, duke Mordo himselfe, and Duncan Steward earle of Lennox were
conuicted of high treason, and beheaded before the castell in semblable manner. [It is a
constant fame (saith Buchanan) though I find it not written in any place, that the king sent
the heads of the father, husband, &amp; children, to Isabell the wife of his coosine germane, to
trie whether she being a fierce woman, would (as it iustlie happened) by distemperance of
griefe discouer the secrets of hir mind. But she (notwithstanding all which grieuous and
vnlooked for spectacles) did not inordinatlie burst out into anie bitter words, but onlie said;
If the faults be true which are laid against them, the king hath doone but right and iustice vnto them.) Thus by the attaindor of duke Mordo and his sonnes, the earldome of
Fife, Menteith, and Lennox came into the kings hands. The residue of the lords and barons
remaining as then in prison, and abiding the kings pleasure, were sore afraid, when they heard
what rigorous iustice had b&eacute;ene executed on duke Morde and his sonnes: notwithstanding,
within 12 moneths after they were all set at libertie, and receiued into the kings fauor, on promise of their Ioiall demeanor &amp; dutifull obedience euer after to be shewed, during their naturall liues.</p>

by the king to the castell of Louchleuine, which was kept against him by the run agat Iames
Steward, whom in short time they forced to surrender the said castell. Not long after, Iohn
Steward of Dernleie (who was maister of the Scotish garrison of horssemen in France, the rest
of the former capteins being consumed) came into Scotland with the bishop of Reims, as ambassador in the name of Charls, to renew the old league betw&eacute;ene the two nations, and to conclude matrimonie betweene Lewes the sonne of the said Charles the seuenth, and Margaret
the daughter of K. Iames, both being yet verie yoong. Which thing so dispatched, in the

mounteins of Granzeben) to subdue the further parts beyond it also. Wherefore to begin the same,
he commanded the castell of Inuernesse (set in a conuenient place in the furthest borders of
Murrey) to be repared. Whither when he came two yeares after, to sit in iudgement vpon
<note place="marg"><date>1428.</date></note>
misdemeanors of the inhabitants, and to suppresse their robberies, he called before him the
chiefe of all the families of that countrie, especiallie such as being accompanied with great
traines, were woont to fetch preies from their next borders, did set tribute on the quieter sort,
and did compell the common people to minister sustenance to those idle loiterers; of which
capteins, some had a thousand, some two thousand, &amp; some far manie more redie at their call
to obeie their commandement; with which they ceassed not to k&eacute;epe the good in danger
vnto them for feare of hurt, and made the euill (amongest whome they were assured of refuge

committed about fortie of their leaders to seuerall prisons: whose euill being throughlie
knowen, he hanged two notable fellows amongst them called Alexander Macror and Iohn
Macarcture; at what time also he beheded Iames Campbell (for the murther of Iohn of the
Iles) a man d&eacute;erelie beloued of his people. The rest which remained (being of the common
sort) they likewise dispersed into diners prisons, whereof some were after executed, and some
were permitted freelie to depart to their owne. The capteins of the factions thus slaine (or for
the most part restreined in prison) the inferior sort durst not attempt anie thing, being destitute
of leaders. Wherevpon the king calling them before him, did giue them a louing admonition to embrace iustice, because there was no surer or certeine hope of safetie in anie thing,
than in the innocencie of life, the which if they would determine to doo, they should alwaies
find him readie to honor and reward them; if not, they might learne by the examples of others
what they should hope to receiue themselues.)</p>

to reforme his former misdemeanors, he was pardoned and set at libertie; wherof insued great
trouble immediatlie after. For shortlie vp&omacr; his deliuerance, he gathered a power of wicked
scapethrifts, and with the same comming into Inuernes, burnt the towne, and besieged the
castell, inforcing with all diligence to win the same, till he was aduertised that the king was
comming towards him with a great power, wherevpon he fled incontinentlie to the Iles. Finallie hauing knowledge that a great number of people lay dailie in wait to take him, that
they might present him to the kings hands, he came disguised in poore araie to the Ilolie rood

house, and there finding the king on Easter daie deuoutlie in the church at his praiers, he fell
downe on his knees before him, and besought him of grace, for his sake that rose as that day
from death vnto life.</p>
<p>At request of the qu&eacute;ene, the king pardoned him of life; but he appointed William Dowglasse earle of Angus to haue the custodie of him, and that within the castell of Temptallon,
that no trouble should rise by his meanes thereafter. His mother Eufemie daughter to Walter sometime earle of Rosse, was also committed to ward in saint Colmes inch; bicause it was
knowne that she sollicited hir sonne to rebell (in maner as is aforesaid) against the king. Not
long after, Donald Ballocht, brother to the said lord Alexander of the Iles, came with a great

power of men into Lochquhaber. The earles of Mar and Cathnes came with such number
of their people as they could raise, to defend the countrie against the inuasion of those Ilandmen, and fought with the said Donald at Inuerlochtie, where the erle of Cathnes was slaine,

with a great armie vnto Dunstafage, purposing with all speed to passe into the Iles. The
clans and other chiefe men of the said Iles aduertised hereof, came to Dunstafage, and submitted themselues vnto the king, excusing their offense, for that (as they alledged) the said
Donald had constreined them against their willes, to passe with him in the last iournie.
All those clans vpon this their excuse, were admitted to the kings fauour, and sworne to pursue the said Donald vnto death.</p>

of his realme, to punish all offenders and misruled persons, which in anie wise wrenged
and oppressed the poore people. He allowed no pardon granted afore by the gouernor, alledging the same to be expired by his death. For he thought ind&eacute;ed it stood neither with the

other to reforme their naughtie vsages, yet one Angus Duffe of Stratherne nothing afraid
thereof, came with a companie of theeues and robbers, and tooke a great preie of goods out

with a great power, and ouertaking the said Angus Duffe neere to Strachnauerne, fiercelie

and reueale his wicked dooings. As soone as she was whole, and recouered of hir wounds,
she went vnto the king, and declared the cruelties doone vnto hir by that vngratious person

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan.</emph></note>
Makdonald in prison, determining to s&eacute;e due punishment for that wicked fact) comforted the sillie
woman, promising hir shortlie to behold a iust reuenge thereof. Wherevpon Makdonald
being brought out of prison with twelue of his companions, the king commanded that they

example of Phalaris, who burnt him first in the bull that was the author thereof for others)

would not ceasse to commit the like, or else reuenge the same) he chopped off Makdonalds
head, &amp; caused his twelue fellowes and partakers to be hanged in the high waies.)</p>

Andrews, to the high aduancement thereof, and was oftentimes himselfe present at their disputations, taking great pleasure therein. Such as were knowne to be learned men, and were
presented to him by the vniuersitie, he preferred to great benefices and other ecclesiasticall
liuings, still as the same chanced to be vacant. [Hauing for that cause made a law in the

he were a batcheller of diuinitie, or at least of the canon law.] By which meanes all maner of vertue and good learning increased dailie through the realme during his time, and namelie musike was had in great price, which he appointed to be vsed in churches with organs, the
<note place="marg">Organs brought into Scotland.</note>
which before his time were not much knowne amongst the Scotishmen.</p>
<p>Much what about the same time, there was a parlement holden at Perth, in the which
<note place="marg">A parlement at Perth.</note>
Henrie Wardlaw bishop of S. Andrews, in name of all the three estates there assembled,
made a long and right pithie oration to this effect: that "Where by the high policie and prudent
<note place="marg">Bishop Wardlaw inueieth against superfluous fare.</note>
diligence of the kings maiestie there present, iustice, and all due administration of lawes and
good ordinances were so reuiued, that nothing s&eacute;emed to be ouerpassed, that might aduance
to the profit and commoditie of the common-wealth; yet was there one wicked vsage crept in
of late, increasing so fast, that if speedie remedie were not had in time, all those commodities
brought into the realme by his comming, should be of small auaile, and that was, such superfluous riot in banketting ch&eacute;ere, and numbers of costlie dishes, as were then taken vp and
vsed after the English fashion, both to the great hinderance of mans health, and also to the
vnprofitable wasting of their goods and substance. If the laudable temperance vsed amongest
the Scotishmen in old time were well considered, nothing might appeare more contrarie and
repugnant thereto, than that new kind of gluttonie then vsed, by receiuing more excesse of
meats and drinks than sufficeth to the nourishment of nature, through prouocation of such
deintie and delicate dishes, confectioned sawces, and deuised potions, as were now brought in
amongst them. As for such gentlemen as the king had brought with him foorth of England,
they were woorthie in d&eacute;ed to be cherished and had in high fauour; neither was this abuse
to be so greatlie imputed vnto them, considering it was appropriate to their nation. But the
Scotishmen themselues were chieflie to be blamed, that had so quicklie y&eacute;elded to so great an
inconuenience, the enormitie whereof appeared by the sundrie vices that followed of the same,
<note place="marg">Vices following delicate fare.</note>
as excesse, sensuall lust, slouth, reiffe, and wasting of goods. For if temperance be the nourisher of all vertue, then must the contrarie, that is to say, intemperance, be the bringer foorth
and prouoker of all vice. If it might therefore please the kings highnesee, to shew his accustomed wisedome and prouidence in repressing this abuse of costlie fare, so much damagable to his people, he should doo the thing that was meritorious before God, and no lesse profitable and necessarie for the publike weale of all his subiects."</p>
<p>By these and manie other the like persuasions, bishop Wardlaw vsed to dissuade the king
and his people from all superfluous courses of delicate dishes and surfetting bankets.

intemperance is risen in processe of time following, that the gr&eacute;edie appetite of gluttons
in this age may be satisfied with no competent f&eacute;eding, till their bellies be so stuffed with
immoderate gorinandise, that they maie scarse fetch breath, through which their noisome surfetting, they fall dailie into sundrie strange and lothsome kinds of diseases, being

of the clocke at after noone, the day being darkened ouer head for the space of one halfe
houre togither, as though it had b&eacute;ene night, and therevpon it was called the blacke houre.
At the next Lammas, the king raised an armie, &amp; came with the same to Roxburgh, 
<note place="marg">Roxburgh besieged.</note>
besieging the castell for the space of fift&eacute;ene daies togither. He had in this armie (as the report went) the number of two hundred thousand men, accounting cariage men &amp; all other

such as followed the campe: yet notwithstanding all this huge multitude, hauing wasted
his powder and other munition, before h&eacute;e could doo anie great hurt to his enimies, he was
constreined to raise his field, and leaue the castell in the Englishmens hands as he found it.

the third, to the further aduancement of the common-wealth, and that his subiects might
haue occasion to auoid slouth and idlenesse (the root of all mischiefe) he brought a great
number of cunning craftesmen out of Germanie, France, and other parties, to instruct his
people in their arts and faculties.</p>
<p>Not long after, one Paule Craw a Bohemian borne, was burnt at saint Andrews, for
preaching and setting foorth the doctrine of Iohn Hus, &amp; Iohn Wikcliffe. Iohn Fogo being one of them that helped chieflie to condemne him, was made (for his great and earnest
diligence therein shewed) abbat of Melrosse. [After which, the said king Iames began
to take vpon him the person of a priuate man, sundrie times associating himselfe to the
companie of others (but especiallie of the merchants) in changed apparell, according to
the state of such persons with whom he would companie, to the end he might thereby
learne what men did say and iudge of him, and so vnderstand what was to be corrected in
the gouernement of the common-wealth.] About the same time was the abbeie of 
<note place="marg">The abbeie of Charturar moonks built besides Perth by K. Iames.</note>

<note place="marg">The lord Scroope ambassador into Scotland.</note>

<note place="marg">The offer of the Englishmen to haue the Scots to ioine with them in leage.</note>
Charturar moonks founded besides Perth, by king Iames, with great cost and magnificence.</p>
<p>Also the lord Scroope and other associats with him, came in ambassage from Henrie the
sixt, king of England. The effect of whose message was, to haue the ancient league betwixt the Scots and Frenchmen dissolued, promising that if the councell of Scotland would
consent thereto, and ioine in leage with the Englishmen; that both the towne and castell
of Berwike, with all the lands lieng betwixt Tw&eacute;ed and the Recrosse (as the Scots write)
should be deliuered into the Scotishmens hands. King Iames hauing small credit in such
faire promises, perceiued the same to tend onlie to this end, that the league betwixt the
Frenchmen and Scots might be once clearelie broken, and then to vse the matter as occasion
should serue their turne. This matter therefore being proponed before the councell, it was
concluded, that in no wise the said league betwixt the Frenchmen and Scots should be dissolued, and so therevpon the English ambassadors were dispatched without more talke concerning that matter.</p>
<p>In the same y&eacute;ere, that is to say, 1433, the king caused George Dunbar erle of March,

<note place="marg">George erle of March arested and put in ward.</note>

his chancellor William Creichton, and Adam Hepborne of Hales to the castell of Dunbar,
deliuering them letters signed with his hand, and directed to the k&eacute;epers of the said castell,
that they shuld deliuer vp the house immediatlie vpon sight of those letters vnto the bringers
of the same. The k&eacute;epers durst not disobeie his commandement, but suffered them to
enter according to their commission. Within twelue moneths after, a parlement was held

against both ciuill and foreine enimies.</p>

ancient inheritance of the earledome of March, to inioy the same till Iames the second came

<note place="marg"><date>1435.</date></note>

<note place="marg">The death of Alexander Steward erle of Mar.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Leodium.</emph></note>
This Alexander was a bastard sonne of the earle of Buchquhan, that was one of the sonnes
of king Robert the second. He was a man of right singular prowesse, and in his youth
following the warres, was with Philip duke of Burgognie at the siege of Liege, or Luike,
where he bare himselfe so manfullie, that few wan the like honor at that iournie. Not
long after, to his high aduancement, he got in mariage the ladie Iacoba countesse of Holland: notwithstanding, he continued but a while with hir, being forced to forgo hir companie, either for that she had another husband, or else for that the inhabitants would not
suffer a stranger to reigne ouer them.</p>
<p>After his returne into Scotland, he sent messengers into Holland, requiring to haue the
<note place="marg">Warres betwixt the earle of Mar &amp; the Hollanders.</note>
issues and profits of such lands as were due vnto him in right of the said countesse his wife;
but receiuing nought saue a froward answer, h&eacute;e prouided him of ships, and made sore
warres on the Hollanders by sea: first being put to the woorse; but at length he tooke
a number of their ships laden with merchandize, as they were returning homewards from
Dantzicke. The mariners were drowned, and the ships burnt. Through which losse the
Hollanders being sore abashed, fell to a composition with him, and tooke truce with the
<note place="marg">Truce twixt the Scots &amp; Hollanders for tearme of 100 y&eacute;eres.</note>
Scots for an hundred y&eacute;eres. This earle of Mar so long as he liued had the gouernance
of the north parts of Scotland vnder king Iames the first, for he was a right prudent person,
as well in warlike enterprises, as in ciuill administration. H&eacute;e brought foorth of Hungarie
sundrie great horsses and mares for generation, that by such meanes the countrie might be
<note place="marg">Good mares brought out of Hungarie into Scotland for brood.</note>
prouided of great horsses of their owne race, where till that time there was none bred
within Scotland, but small nags, more m&eacute;et to serue for iournieng hacknies, than for anie
seruice in the warres.</p>
<p>Not long before this time, there came an ambassage from the king of Denmarke to king
<note place="marg">Ambassadors out of Denmarke.</note>

<note place="marg">Their request.</note>
Iames, requiring him to make paiment of such y&eacute;erelie tribute as was due to the said king

and agreement made by Alexander sometime king of Scotland, the third of that name, vnto
his predecessor Magnus, at that time king of Norwaie. The ambassadors that came with
this message were honorablie receiued, and in like sort interteined by king Iames, who at
their departure gaue to them sundrie rich gifts, and appointed sir William Creichton to go

sagelie in this businesse which he thus went about, that renewing the old league betwixt the
two realmes of Denmarke and Scotland, stedfast peace and assured amitie without anie more
adoo therof insued. Much about the same time, there came ambassadors from the French
king, Charles the seuenth, not onelie desiring to haue the old league betwixt France and
Scotland to be ratified at that present by a new confirmation, but also to confirme the same
with better assurance. Margaret eldest daughter to king Iames, at request of the said king
Charles, was giuen in mariage vnto Lewes the Dolphin, and eldest sonne to the said king
Charles.</p>
<p>Manie great lords of Scotland were appointed to haue the conueiance of hir into France,
and great prouision of ships made for that voiage, because the king was aduertised that the
Englishmen had a fl&eacute;et abroad on the seas, to take hir if they might m&eacute;et with hir by the
<note place="marg">Englishmen lie in wait for the Scotish fl&eacute;et.</note>
waie. But as the hap fell, it chanced the same time, as the Scotish ships should passe, there
app&eacute;ered on the coast of England, a great fleet of Spaniards, which the Englishmen 
<note place="marg">The Englishmen incounter a fl&eacute;et of Spaniards.</note>
supposing to be the Scots, they came vpon them with foure score vessels of one and other,
thinking verelie to haue had their wished preie, euen according to their expectation: but
being receiued with as hot a storme as they brought, they quicklie vnderstood how they

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"425"</fw>-->

were in a wrong box, and so shrewdlie amazed (as Hector Boetius saith) they susteined
great losse both in men and ships, and in the meane time the Scotish nauie passed by quietlie
without damage, incountering not one ship by the waie that sought to impeach their passage.
There went 140 ladies and gentlewomen foorth of Scotland, to attend this ladie Margaret
<note place="marg">The arriuall of the ladie Margaret of Scotland in France.</note>

<note place="marg">Henrie Persie inuadeth Scotland.</note>

<p>In the meane time, whilest such things were a dooing, Henrie Persie of Northumberland
inuaded Scotland with foure thousand men, not being knowen whether he had commission
so to doo from the king of England, or that he made that enterprise of himselfe. William
Dowglasse earle of Angus, to resist this inuasion, gathered a power of chosen men, amongest
whome were Adam Hepborne of Hales, Alexander Ramseie of Dalehouse, and Alexander
Elphingston, with others. The earle of Angus being thus associat, met the Persie at

Piperden, where a sore battell was foughten betwixt them, with great slaughter on both sides;
but at length the victorie fell to the Scots, though there were slaine togither with Alexander
Elphingston, two hundred gentlemen and commons of Scotland: and of the English part
there died Henrie of Cliddesdale, Iohn Ogill, and Richard Persie, with fifteene hundred
other of gentlemen and commons, of the which gentlemen, fortie were knights. There
were taken also and brought home by the Scots as prisoners, to the number of foure
hundred.</p>
<p>Shortlie heerevpon, king Iames raised a mightie armie, and besieged the castell of Rocksburgh, but when he had almost brought his purpose so n&eacute;ere to passe, that those within
began to fall to communication, for the rendering of the place, the qu&eacute;ene came to the
campe in great haste vnto him, signifieng that there was a conspiracie begun against him,
so that if he tooke not the better h&eacute;ed, he was in great danger to fall into the hands of those
that sought his life. The king doubting the matter, raised his siege and returned home to
<note place="marg">The king informed of a conspiracie made against him, raiseth his siege.</note>

<note place="marg">The earle of Atholl heard of the conspiracie.</note>

<note place="marg">Robert Graham.</note>
prouide the better for his owne suertie, but that preuailed little: for Walter Steward earle of
Atholl, and head of the whole conspiracie, pretending euer a right to the crowne, by reason
that he was procreat by king Robert the second on his first wife, procured his nephue
Robert Steward, and his coosine Robert Graham, to slea the king by one meane or other,
which finallie they accomplished in this wise. This Robert Graham, for diuerse wicked
acts before committed, contrarie to the lawes and ordinances of the realme, was driuen to
an outlawrie, so that if he were taken, he looked for nothing but present death, and therefore hated the king most deadlie. And though by the qu&eacute;enes diligence both his and other
of the conspirators purposes were now disappointed, hauing contriued to dispatch the king
at the siege of Rocksburgh; yet forsomuch as their names were not knowne, they hoped
still to find occasion to atchiue their detestable intention, sith they were no more mistrusted
than the others.</p>
<p>H&eacute;erevpon the said Steward and Graham came one euening to the blacke friers of Perth,
<note place="marg">Robert Steward and Robert Graham murtherers of the king.</note>
where the king as then was lodged, and by licence of the porters comming into the house,
entered vp into the gallerie before the kings chamber doore, minding to haue staied there
till one of the kings seruants that was priuie to their diuelish purpose should come, by whose
helpe they were promised to haue entrie into the chamber. But before the comming of this
Iudas like traitor, an other of the kings seruants named Walter Straiton came foorth of the
chamber doore to haue fetched wine for the king: but being aduised of these two traitors
standing there at the doore, either of them hauing a long swoord girded to him, he stept
backe, and cried, Treason: but yer he could get within the doore to haue made it fast, they
<note place="marg">Walter Straiton is slaine.</note>
leapt vnto him, and slue him there outright.</p>
<p>Whilest this was a dooing, not without great noise &amp; rumbling, a yoong virgin named
<note place="marg">Katharine Dowglasse.</note>
Katharine Dowglasse (that was after maried to Alexander Louell of Bolunnie) got to the
doore, and shut it: but because the barre was awaie that should haue made it fast, she
thrust hir arme in the place where the bar should haue passed: she was but yoong, and
hir bones not strong, but rather tender as a gristle, and therefore hir arme was soone crasht
in sunder, and the doore broken vp by force. Herewith entering the chamber, they slue

such of the seruants as made defense, and then the king himselfe with manie cruell and
deadlie wounds [at 28 seuerall blowes.] The qu&eacute;ene was also hurt as she was about to

for dead on the floore, by reason of such wounds as he receiued in the kings defense, dooing
most manfullie his vttermost deuoire to haue preserued him from the murtherers hands.
Thus was Iames the first murthered the 21 day of Februarie, the 44 y&eacute;ere of his age, the

of bodie of the middle stature, with broad shoulders, hauing the other parts also answering

the most excellent conformitie of members in this our king) dooth terme to be squared or
of euen proportion, as the parts of a quadrangle or iust square doo answer ech other, so
that nature s&eacute;emeth not to haue framed a creature more apt or excellent than he, either
for shape of bodie, or for kinglie maiestie. He did manie times imbrace iustice more
streictlie and seuerelie, than well became a king, which ought to be called (and so in truth
to be) the father and nourisher of the common wealth. For he s&eacute;emed so exactlie to
measure all things by the rule of iustice, that he is said (within the space of thr&eacute;e yeeres)
to haue executed thr&eacute;e thousand persons for their committed offenses. Although this may
rather s&eacute;eme to be a slander (than otherwise) grounded vpon no foundation, since all
things s&eacute;emed to haue b&eacute;ene performed by him in respect of sincere zeale of iustice,
whereof this may be a sufficient argument, that he was of so mild and sw&eacute;et nature, that
we read not of anie of our princes that did more reuerentlie imbrace peace at home amongst
his subiects, or more willinglie conclude the same abroad with strangers. What shall I
say of his wisedome, which in manie and the greatest affaires did so manifestlie app&eacute;ere,
that the kings of other nations did ioine in league and friendship with him? Of which
wisedome, and of other his vertues (although he obteined part by the benefit of nature)
he got the greatest summe by the learning &amp; instruction which he purchased in England,
when he was prisoner: at what time he was by the commandement of Henrie the king
most diligentlie instructed. For he was there by the kings beneuolence so well trained
in all sciences and gentlemanlie actiuitie, with the diligence of good schoolemaisters, that
it is not easie to iudge what science he best vnderstood: for beside that he had skill in
all kinds of musike (but most excellent in plaieng on the harpe) he was so good an orator,
that nothing might be more artificiall than that which he spake: againe, he was a rare poet,
in which he s&eacute;emed not so much cunning by art, as furthered by nature, which is sufficientlie prooued by verses of diuerse kinds (at this day remaining) composed by him (in
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan.</emph> also saith he wrote Latine verses with such good grace, as the rudenesse of that age permitted.</note>
Scotish m&eacute;eter) with that singular art, as he is thought fullie to equall the sharpenesse,
grauitie, and wisedome of the ancient poets.</p>
<p>It is strange that I saie, and far beyond the diligence of the princes of our time, yea and
almost beyond the opinion of men: but yet most true and confirmed by the testimonie of
them which knew him well: and therefore to be written to his perpetuall praise. He did
so exactlie in mind and memorie comprehend the depth of diuinitie and law, that therein he
excelled manie, &amp; in his time gaue not place to anie: to conclude, there was nothing wherein
the commendation of wit consisted, or wherein anie shew of the liberall arts appeared, that he
would not with great diligence applie his indeuor for the knowledge thereof, yea and that
sometime to all mechanicall or handie-craft labors which were m&eacute;et for a free man, which
he is said most studiouslie to haue followed. But in the end, iudging it ouer base for
kinglie maiestie to be exercised in these meane &amp; inferior knowledges, he caused artificers
of all sorts to be brought out of England, Flanders, and other nations, which should instruct our people therein; for by that means he persuaded himselfe he should in the end

a mild and sw&eacute;ete condition of life &amp; maners. Wherefore I may well say; O most happie
common-wealth which was gouerned by so woorthie a prince: &amp; may iustlie exclame; O
you most fierce and wicked rebels, that would by murther take away such an honor, beautie,
and piller of the common-wealth. Now, besides manie other things by him doone, I will
here (being better late than neuer) set downe this (not touched before) which is, that he
was not onlie a beautie to his countrie, in prouiding for his people to liue at quiet within
doores; but he also sought for the defense of his realme against his enimies without doores:
by artillerie, and other necessaries required for the warres. For the inuention of guns
hapning about his time, or not much before; he caused certeine p&eacute;eces of artillerie to be

that at the length they were apprehended and brought to Edenburgh, where they were
executed on this maner. The earle of Atholl, which was not onelie principall in practise of
this treason concerning the kings death, but also in times past was chiefe of counsell with
Robert duke of Albanie, in making away of Dauid the kings eldest brother, and after the
kings returne foorth of England did most earnestlie solicit him to put duke Mordo to death,
with all other of his linage, trusting that when they were dispatched, he should find means
to rid the king also, and his children out of the way, &amp; so at length atteine to the crowne without anie obstacle. This earle (I say) was first stripped of all his clothes, saue onelie his
shirt; and then was an instrument of wood, made like to the drawer of a well, set fast in
<note place="marg">The execution of the erle of Atholl.</note>
a cart with a frame: at the end of which instrument, was the earle fastened and bound, and
so caried about the towne, sometime hoised on high, that the people might s&eacute;e him aloft in
the aire, and sometime let fall againe with a swaie downe vpon the pauement.</p>
<p>After this, being brought to an open place, where most resort of people was, they crowned
him with an hot iron, for that (as was said) a witch had told him, that before his death he
<note place="marg">The prophesie of a witch.</note>
should be crowned openlie in sight of the people. Through whose illusion being deceiued,
he liued vnder vaine hope to atteine the crowne, directing all his imaginations to compasse
the means thereto. Thus was he serued on the first day. On the second day, he was
drawen with his complices laid on hurdels, round about the towne at an horsse taile. The
third day, his bellie was ript, and his bowels were taken foorth, and throwne into the fire
flickering before his eies, &amp; then was his heart pulled foorth of his bodie, and throwne
likewise into the fire: and last of all, his head was cut off, and his bodie diuided into foure
quarters.</p>

in seeking to haue the whole gouernment of the realme in their hands. The chancellor
<note place="marg">An agr&eacute;ement made.</note>
then perceiuing himselfe destitute of all helpe, made agreement with the gouernor, vnder
certeine conditions, that he should reteine still the castell of Edenburgh vnder his possession,
and likewise continue still in his office of chancellor. Shortlie after the earle of Dowglasse
<note place="marg">The earle of Dowglasse departeth this life at Lestelricke.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1439.</date></note>
deceassed at Lestelricke, in the yeare 1439, against whome aswell the gouernor as chancellor had conceiued great hatred. He left behind him a sonne (begot of the earle of Crawfords daughter) named William, a child of fourt&eacute;ene yeares of age, who succeeded his father
in the earldome of Dowglasse, appearing at the first to be well inclined of nature, but afterwards by euill companie he waxed wild and insolent.</p>
<p>About this season, Iames Steward sonne to the lord of Lorne, maried the qu&eacute;ene Dowager, and fauored the earle Dowglasse in his vnrulie demeanor: wherevpon, both the said
Iames and his brother William, with the qu&eacute;ene, were committed to prison in the castell of

Striueling by the gouernors appointment; but shortlie after they were released by the sute
of the lord chancellor, sir William Creichton, and Alexander Seton of Gurdon, who became
suerties for their good abearing, vnder great forfeiture of sufficient band. About the same
time, or rather somewhat before, Alane Steward lord of Dernlie was slaine at Palmais thorne,
<note place="marg">Alane Steward is slain.</note>
by sir Thomas Boid. And in the yeare following, the same sir Thomas was slaine by Alexander Steward of Bolmet and his sonnes; where through there rose great troubles in the west
part of Scotland. William earle of Dowglasse sent Malcolme Fleming of Cumernald, and
Alane of Lowder, vnto Charles the seuenth, king of France, to obteine of him the duchie
of Towraine, which was giuen to Archembald Dowglasse at the battell of Vernoill in Perth;
and the last earle, father to this earle William, had inioied the same all his life time, wherevpon that sute was the sooner obteined: which made the yoong earle more insolent than
before.</p>
<p>He kept such a port, and vsed' to haue such a traine attending vpon him, speciallie when
<note place="marg">The great port of the erle of Dowglasse.</note>
he came to the court, that it should s&eacute;eme he had the king in small regard; for he thought
himselfe safe inough in mainteining the like state and port, or rather greater than euer his
father at anie time had mainteined before him: insomuch as he would ride with two thousand horsse, of the which number there were diuerse errant th&eacute;eues and robbers, that were
borne out in their vnlawfull and wicked practises by the same earle. Certeine capteins
of the Iles, as Lachlane, Makelaine, and Murdac Gipson, with a wicked number of the
inhabitants of the same Iles, haried, spoiled, and burnt the countrie of Lenox, and slue Iohn

This yeare also the gouernor tooke the whole administration vpon him, wherewith the chancellor was displeased, and leauing the king and him in Striueling, repared to Edenburgh,
where he deuised the way how to recouer the king from the gouernor, and so on a morning
tooke foure and twentie men with him, and rode to the parke of Striueling where the king
was then hunting, and the gouernor absent at Perth.</p>

him, being in some feare to s&eacute;e such companie come vnto him, hauing so few in his traine.
Which when the chancellor perceiued, he praied the king to be of good comfort, and in few
words (fit for that time) exhorted him that he should looke to himselfe and the kingdome,
and deliuer himselfe from the imprisonment of Alexander the gouernor, liuing fr&eacute;elie from
hencefoorth after a kinglie maner; that he should not accustome himselfe to obeie the pleasure and couetousnes of others, that he should vse to command his subiects in all iust and
lawfull causes; and that he should deliuer his people from these euils which increased vpon
them, by the ambition and couetousnesse of the rulers, which he could not now well remedie or resist, except the king would take on him the gouernement, the which to doo, he
had without all danger or trouble prouided a meane. For he had in a readinesse sufficient

number therefore, which should attend vpon the king where so euer he would go, or to
vse anie other matter as n&eacute;ed should require. Which the king taking with a pleasant countenance (either because the matter liked him well, or to dissemble the feare he had of the
chancellor) did fullie approoue, and went with his small vnarmed companie and the chancellor toward Edenburgh.)</p>
<p>The chancellor (as Hector Boetius saith) had caused the number of foure thousand 
<note place="marg">The king went with the chancellor to Edenburgh.</note>
horssemen of his seruants, tenants, and friends, secretlie to be readie that morning about the town
of Striueling, to resist his aduersaries if they should haue vsed anie force against him: and
now vnderstanding of the kings going thus with the chancellor, they came to him on the
way, and attending him, brought him safelie and without further trouble vnto Edenburgh,
where he was ioifullie receiued. The gouernor when he was aduertised hereof, was grieuouslie displeased; but because he knew not how to remedie the matter, he went to Edenburgh, and there got Iohn Iunes bishop of Murrey, and Henrie Lichton bishop of 
<note place="marg">The gouernor and chancellor are made friends.</note>
Aberdene, to labor some agreement betwixt him and the chancellor: which they did in this
wise: the king to remaine in the k&eacute;eping of the chancellor, and the gouernor to continue
his office. And so by this accord they were made friends.</p>
<p>* During which turmoiles, William Dowglasse (that with a certeine pride of mind had
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 8. <emph>pag.</emph> 294.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 11.</note>
highlie borne himselfe, disobeieng the rule of the gouernor, &amp; disdaining to ioine in societie
of the chancellor) did vew the dedlie hatred of them both against him; for which cause
they s&eacute;eke by all means vtterlie to take him awaie. For the dooing whereof (to the end it
might be performed without anie tumult) they appoint a parlement to be holden at Edenburgh: whither came not a few (as at other times in such assemblies it alwaies hapheth)
but almost the whole countries came flocking thither, to complaine of the iniuries which they
had receiued: of which sort, there was such a miserable shew, that men could not behold
the same without great motion of a pitifull mind: when euerie one for himselfe, the father
for the children, the children for the fathers, and the widows for their husbands, did complaine that they were by the robbers spoiled of all their substance. Wherevpon (as it happeneth alwaies through pietie of gentle harts, to rue the afflicted) there arose great enuie against
the capteins and leaders of the wicked dooers of such spoile, whose euils were now growne
to such excesse, as by no means they might be suffered; whose factions were so largelie spread
ouer the realme, that none could defend their life or liuehood: but such as did y&eacute;eld themselues to their actions, and whose riches were so increased, as the weake could not well find
anie helpe (in the authoritie of the magistrate) against their violence.</p>
<p>Wherevpon it liked the wiser sort (since their force s&eacute;emed not almost able to be broken,
or their parts to be seuered) to flie to policie and leaue strength, not daring openlie to call the
earle Dowglasse by that name of capteine of them, although they well knew him to be the
chiefe author and fautor of those people. Wherefore the gouernor and the chancellor
(for a time dissembling the hatred which they harboured against Dowglasse) persuaded the
whole parlement, that it were more conuenient with faire sp&eacute;eches to pacifie Dowglasse, than
with shew of suspicious and euill words to stirre him to further heat: especiallie considering
that he was of that great wealth and power, that he alone, if he stood against them, might
hinder all the decrees of the parlement: but if h&eacute;e ioined with the nobilitie, there might be
easie remedie found to salue all these present euils. Through which wise and subtill persuasion of Alexander the gouernour, it was decr&eacute;ed amongst them, that there should be honourable letters directed to him in the common &amp; speciall name of all the nobilitie, which
should admonish him, that being mindfull of the honorable place which he possessed (and of
his woorthie ancestors, by whome the common-wealth of Scotland had receiued manie singular benefits) h&eacute;e should repaire to the parlement, which well could not, and willinglie
would not, either k&eacute;epe or determine any thing in the same without his presence. In which
assemblie, if h&eacute;e would complaine of anie wrongs or griefes offered vnto him, h&eacute;e should be
satisfied so fullie as they might lawfullie.</p>
<p>And if he or anie of his friends or familie had committed anie disordered part, the nobilitie

there met would rullie remit the same, as well for the nobilitie of his, and the woorthie me.
morie of the d&eacute;eds doone by his ancestors; as for that they rather attributed such actions to
the iniurie of the times, and the frailtie of his age, and the persuasion of others, than vnto
him, of whome there was conceiued a singular hope of great towardnesse, for the aduancement of his name and benefit of his countrie. Therfore if he would come and
ioine with them, he should receiue in gouernement what part, place, and office of the common-wealth pleaseth him, to the end that as in times past, their countrie had b&eacute;ene manie
waies deliuered out of most heauie dangers by the hand of the Dowglasses, so at this present, the same might also by his presence and furtherance, be againe aduanced and
strengthened from and against those intestine euils wherewithall it now fainted. The yoong
man (by nature and age gr&eacute;edie of glorie) being mooued with these flatteries, and the other
persuasions of his friends (whereof euerie one was blinded with a certeine hope of good to
happen to himselfe) they now d&eacute;emed it best (forgetting all former dangers) to thinke
vpon their priuate commodities, and with that resolution tooke their iournie to come to the
parlement.</p>
<p>The chancellor when he vnderstood they were on there way, rode foorth of Edenburgh
manie miles to m&eacute;et the Dowglasse, and courteouslie inuited the earle to his castell of
Creichton, which laie in his waie as he should ride, at which place he was most honourablie
interteined by the chancellor. Where, when they had remained two daies, the chancellor
(after h&eacute;e had shewed manie tokens of a friendlie mind vnto him) bicause he would vtterlie
banish from the earle all suspicion of him, that he had anie mislike in the said earle) began familiarlie to persuade him, that (rememembring the kings dignitie, and the office of him whome
the lot of inheritance, their countrie lawes, and the consent of the parlement had aduanced to
the gouernement and administration of all things) he should in all humilitie acknowledge
him for his chiefe lord and king; that he would permit the large patrimonie obteined by
the bloud of his ancestors to descend to posteritie by lineall inheritance as he himselfe receiuedit; that he would clearelie deliuer the name and familie of the Dowglasses (no lesse famous
for their dutie, than their d&eacute;eds) not onelie from the filthie spot of treason, but also from all
note of suspicion thereof; that he would refraine himselfe and his from offering iniuries to the
weake and common people; that he would remooue from him all such as were giuen to robberie and spoile; that he would from hencefoorth applie himselfe to the defense of iustice,
to the end that his former offenses (if there were anie) might rather be attributed to euill
counsell of the wicked, than to the naturall disposition of himselfe: for so the repentance of
his yoong y&eacute;eres might be taken for proofe of his innocencie in such euils. With these
and such like sp&eacute;eches, declaring the faith of a wel-willing mind, he allured the earle to
come to Edenburgh with Dauid his brother partaker of all his counsels and actions.</p>
<p>This faire tale of the chancellor, more than in times past or then bes&eacute;emed the place which
he possessed, with the manie messengers sent to him from Alexander the gouernor (to meet
him on the way) almost euerie houre, draue a d&eacute;epe suspicion in the heads of the earles
companie riding with him to Edenburgh, of some trecherie to be ment towards him. Wherevpon the same began to be blundered from one to another of the traine, and came so
fast to the friends of Dowglasse, that some of them did boldlie and liberallie admonish
him, that he should remaine in that purpose (which once he did) to staie, to returne, and not
to go forward with the chancellor: and at the least (if he would aduenture himself) to send
home his brother Dauid, to the end that h&eacute;e might not hazard the whole familie vnder the fortune of one stroke, as his father had before admonished him when he died. Whereat the vnaduised youth of this man, being mooued to anger against his friends, did by the voices of
some of his men (as it were by one that should make proclamation therfore) pacifie the secret
murmurings that were amongest the companie; and answered such of his friends as found fault
therewith, that he sufficientlie knew, that it was the common plague of all great families, alwaies to haue such men about them, as being impatient of quiet and ease, respect not the danger
and miserie of their patrons, so it maie be commoditie vnto them: who (bicause they would not

be restreined within the bounds of peacefull lawes) are authors of sedition, in which (when all
things are in turmoile) they may the better wander abroad to satisfie their euill humor: whose
speaches h&eacute;e regarded not, since hee rather respected and trusted the approoued wisedome
of the chancellor and the gouernor, than the slouthfull &amp; rash minds of such seditious
persons.</p>
<p>After which (to cut awaie occasion from the rest to answer) he set spurres to his horsse,
and hastened his iourneie more than he did before, with his brother and a few of his
other friends, taking his right course into the castell, and (as it were by a certeine destinie)
casting himselfe hedlong into the snares of his enimies. At such time as he came to the
castell, the gouernor (according to his promise) was readie there to m&eacute;et him, to the end
the matter might s&eacute;eme to be wrought by common consent, and the weight of so great enuie
might not light vpon the head of one man. Dowglasse being honorablie and friendlie by the
gouernor receiued into the castell, was for dinner placed at the kings table. But in the middest of this sweet meat (sower sawce being prepared) there was a bulles head set before him,
which in those daies was a signe of death. Wherewith the yoong man amazed (and greatlie
troubled in his mind, inwardlie repenting that he followed not the aduise of his followers) was
about to rise from the table: but being apprehended by armed men (appointed to that function) he was caried into the court next to the castell, and was there (in reuenge and punishment of his vnbrideled youth) beheaded, with his brother Dauid, and Malcolme Fleming, who
(next vnto his brother) was in greatest credit with him. Whose death the king now entring
into his adolescencie or y&eacute;ers (as we tearme it) of discretion, is said heauilie with teares to
lament, which the chancellor (grieuing to s&eacute;e) did greatlie rebuke in the king such vntimelie
and inordinate mourning, for the death of his and the common-wealths enimie, whose life (said
h&eacute;e) would haue taken awaie all peace and tranquillitie in the realme.</p>
<p>After the death of the said earle, the state of the realme became more quiet: for his
vncle Iames Dowglasse baron of Abircorne that succ&eacute;eded him, being a man of great stature,
and verie fat, gaue himselfe to quietnesse, and liued but thr&eacute;e yeeres after. The foresaid
William had but one sister, that was called the faire maiden of Galloway, and was maried
to one William Dowglasse, sonne to this earle Iames before his deceasse, that the heritage should not be diuided: bicause the earledome of Dowglasse was intailed vpon the heires
male, and the lands of Wigton, Balwanie, Annardale; and Ormont remained to hir as heire
generall. This earle William, after the deceasse of his father earle Iames, began to wax
vnrulie, and to follow the vntoward maners of the other William Dowglasse latelie beheaded (as before ye haue heard) so that by support manie disobedient persons would not
obeie the gouernor and chancellor, whervpon sundrie great slaughters and oppressions were
committed.</p>
<p>* Againe (by the mariage of this earle William with his rich kinswoman) he did (besides
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
his vnrulie behauiour) aduance himselfe in pride, whereof grew secret enuie, and of that
rose open malice: but he incountering sufficientlie with them, partlie by force, &amp; partlie by
subtiltie, mainteined his people in those oppressions and robberies, in despite of the proudest: which occasioned the nobilitie to iudge, that the said earle was priuie of their misdemeanor. Amongest which euill disposed companie, there was one Iohn Gormacke of
Atholl, who (when he had infected all the countrie about him with this miserable plague
of robberie) did set vpon William Ruwene (shiriffe of Perth, and had almost killed him)
because he had led a th&eacute;efe of Atholl to execution. But at the length (true men being 
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 11.</note>
alwaies better than th&eacute;eues) the shiriffe recouered the battell, and killed the capteine Gormacke,
with thirtie of his companie, and put the rest to flight into the mounteins.</p>
<p>In the y&eacute;ere 1445, not manie daies after, the castell of Dunbreton (which is not by
<note place="marg"><date>1443.</date></note>
strength to be subdued) was twise taken within a few daies: for Robert Semplier that
was capteine of the inferior castell, and Patrike Galbrith capteine of the higher castell, did
so diuide their gouernement of the said castell (being a thing of great circuit) that euerie one
had a peculiar and seuered entrance into his owne part without offense of the other. But yet

not their factions, whome they did follow: for Patrike was secretlie thought to fauour Dowglasse, for which cause Semplier, or (as some haue Simplie) the other capteine perceiuing
the part of the castell wherein Patrike ruled to be more negligentlie kept, than dutie or
the state of the time required, found opportunitie to expell Patrike from thence, and to cause
all his furniture to be caried out of the same, conuerting the said castell to his owne vse.
In the end (the next day after) Patrike vnderstanding thereof, and comming with foure
vnarmed persons (to fetch awaie his furniture and houshold-stuffe) entered into the castell;
and first finding the porter alone, turned him awaie, then taking armor, expelled the others
out of the higher castell: after which, calling aid out of the towne next adioining, he shut
them also out of the inferior castell, and got possession of the whole castell to himselfe.)</p>
<p>The king, after he came to the age of fouret&eacute;ene y&eacute;eres, would not anie longer be vnder

<note place="marg">The king wil rule himselfe.</note>
the gouernement of others, but tooke the rule vpon himselfe. The earle of Dowglasse informed thereof, came to him at Striueling, and put himselfe and all he had to remaine at
his pleasure: wherevpon the king receiued him, pardoned all his passed misdemeanors,
and admitted him to be one of his speciall friends and priuie councellors in all his affaires.
By his persuasion shortlie after, sir Alexander Leuingston, &amp; William Creichton being discharged of their offices, were also put off from the councell, and all their friends banished
the court, and they themselues were summoned to app&eacute;ere before the king: which because
they refused to doo, they were proclamed rebels, and put to the horne. The earle Dowglasse then for the old grudge he bare them, raised an armie, and harried their lands. In
reuenge wherof, sir William Creichton spoiled the earle of Dowglasse his lands, so that
great trouble was raised through the whole countrie, and the lands of Strabroke, Abircorne,
&amp; the towne of Blacknesh were burnt and destroied.</p>
<p>The earle of Dowglasse ruled wholie about the king, &amp; made Archembald his brother
<note place="marg">1445. <emph>Lesle.</emph></note>
earle of Murrey, by ioining him in mariage with a ladie of the house of Dunbar inheretrix
therof. Morouer, Hugh Dowglasse was made earle of Ormont. Thus the earle of Dowglasse aduanced his name, and ioined in friendship with the earle of Crawford, with Donald
earle of the Iles, and with the earle of Rosse, to the end that ech of them should be assistant
to others. In this meane time, the earle of Crawford at the request of the earle of Dowglas,
tooke a great preie of goods out of the bishop of S. Andrews lands in Fife, which bishop
was called Iames Kenedie, sisters son to king Iames the first: where through the earle of
Crawford on the one part, and the earle of Huntleie with the Ogiluies on the other, met at
Arbroth in set battell, where the earle of Crawford was slaine, and diuerse barons on his
side, although the victorie and field remained with his sonne, the maister of Crawford, who
succeeded his father, and was called earle Beirdie. On the earle of Huntleies side were
slaine, Iohn Forbes of Petslege, Alexander Berkelie of Gartulie, Robert Maxwell of Teline,
William Gurdun of Burrowfield, sir Iohn Oliphant of Aberdagie, and fiue hundred more on
their side, and one hundred of the victorers were also slaine, as Hector Boetius saith.</p>
<p>The same writer reporteth that the occasion of this battell did chance, through the variance
that fell out betwixt the earle of Crawfords eldest sonne Alexander Lindseie, and Alexander
Ogilbie or Ogiluie (as some write him) about the office of the bailiffewike of Arbroth, the
which the maister of Crawford inioieng, was displaced and put out by the said Ogiluie.
Wherevpon the maister of Crawford, to recouer his right (as he tooke it) got a power togither with helpe of the Hamiltons, and with the same seized vpon the abbeie, and Ogiluie
with helpe of the earle of Huntlie, came thither with an armie to recouer the place againe
out of his aduersaries hands, and so vpon knowledge h&eacute;ereof giuen vnto the earle of Crawford, he himselfe comming from Dundee vnto Arbroth, at the verie instant when the battels
were readie to ioine, caused first his sonne to staie; and after calling foorth sir Alexander
Ogiliue to talke with him, in purpose to haue made peace betwixt him and his sonne, was
thrust into the mouth with a speare, by a common souldier that knew nothing what his

demand ment, so that he fell downe therewith, and presentlie died in the place: wherevpon
togither the parties went incontinentlie without more protracting of time, and so fought with
such successe, as before ye haue heard. The earle of Huntleie escaped by flight: but
Alexander Ogiluie being taken and sore wounded, was led to the castell of Fineluin, where
shortlie after he died of his hurts. This battell was fought the 24 of lanuarie, in the y&eacute;ere

William Creichton knight, to deliuer vp the castell of Edenburgh. But Creichton (saieng
that the castell was committed to his gouernement by the whole realme, and that the king
had not anie thing to doo therewith vntill he came to his full age) had all his goods foorthwith confiscat to the kings vse, with his castell of Creichton, which the kings people entered into and possessed. But least they should s&eacute;eme to offer anie manifest wrong to the
said Creichton, they gaue out the same edict (as a veile of their malice and enuie) which
Creichton had before caused to be established and proclamed. For he first of all others
made a law, that whosoeuer did denie or resist the king, demanding the deliuerie of aniecastell, should be in danger of treason; the breach and execution of which law did first
come and fall by and vpon him, by whome that might be worthilie said (which is vsed to
be spoken in common prouerbe) He is fallen into the snare which he prepared for others.
Wherevpon the Dowglasse (since the castell would not otherwise be deliuered) sharpelie besieged the same by the space of nine moneths, which in the end Creichton surrendered into
his hands, on certeine conditions to be performed. At which time also the said Creichton
<note place="marg">1446. <emph>Lesle.</emph></note>
was reinuested with the honor of the chancellorship, although he neuer after intangled himselfe with affaires of the kingdome, hoping that in time to come (when the darke clouds of
the wicked men, which had now ouerspread all things, were ouerblowen) a better forme
of gouernement would be brought in, as a certeine light to giue shine to the commonwealth.</p>
<p>Iames Steward a woorthie knight (not he that was surnamed The blacke) was slaine at
Kirkepatrike, two miles from Dunbreton, by Alexander Lilie, and Robert Boid, whose
crueltie not being satisfied with his bloud, they laboured to bring his wife (great with child,
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 11.</note>
&amp; vpon point of deliuerance) within their danger. For the performance whereof, they sent
a priest vnto hir, that (in haste and as it were troubled) should tell hir in what distresse
she now rested, and that there was no meanes to relieue himselfe by anie waie (since euerie
place was beset with horsse and footmen) vnlesse she escaped by bote to Robert Boid at
Dunbreton, who further vpon oth promised hir, that he would safelie bring hir backe to hir
owne house.</p>
<p>The woman being credulous (and ignorant that Robert Boid was present at the death of
hir husband) and caried out of Cardrosse, into the Dunbreton castell, might easilie perceiue hir selfe hardlie beset on euerie side by the deceipt of hir enimies, who (being so
deceiued and ouercome with feare &amp; griefe) was deliuered of child before hir time, and
(togither with hir sonne) died there within few houres after. Almost at the same time,
Patrike Hepburne (gouernour of Halis) held the castell of Dunbar, where he had Iane
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 11.</note>
Seimer the qu&eacute;ene with him, to whome she fled for succour in the times of these tumults.
Archembald Dunbar (supposing this to be a iust cause of anger) in the night did set vpon
Halis the castell of Hepburne, which he tooke at the first assault, by sleaing of the watch,
who being stroken with a great feare for the same, did (in few daies after) restore the
same to earle Dowglasse, with conuenant that all they which were within, should depart in
safetie without anie danger.)</p>
<p>Sir Iames Steward surnamed the Blacke knight, husband to the qu&eacute;ene the kings mother,
<note place="marg">Iames Steward is banished the realme.</note>
was banished the realme for speaking woords against the misgouernement of the king and
realme, wherewith he offended the earle of Dowglasse. As he passed the seas towards
Flanders, he was taken by the Flemings, &amp; shortlie after departed this life. The qu&eacute;ene his wife

by the assistance of all the nobles of Scotland, with great banketting, ioifull mirth, and all

Creichton was also forfalted for diuerse causes, but principallie for that his seruants would
not deliuer the house of Creichton to the kings herald, who charged them so to doo. This

for to haue the wars ceasse on that side, because the warre betwixt them and France was
verie hotlie pursued, and ciuill dissention disquieted the state of England, which was raised
betwixt the two houses of Lancaster &amp; Yorke. * This yeere there were manic m&eacute;etings

of such as applied themselues to spoiling of other men; wherevpon a long peace followed
in Scotland: beside which, there were other lawes made for auoiding of treasons, and
chieflie of such as touched the kinglie maiestie. This lawe of treason was afterward executed first vpon Dowglasse, which was author thereof. In this parlement were manie

chieflie made their inuasions, because that from thence the first occasion of all this mischiefe
might s&eacute;eme to haue had the beginning. When such things were certified to the king of
Englands councell, an armie was appointed foorthwith to inuade Scotland, vnder the leading
of the earle of Northumberland, and of one Magnus surnamed Redberd, a capteine of great
<note place="marg">A knight named Magnus.</note>
experience, as he that had beene trained vp from his youth in the warres of France. The
Scots, because of his long red berd, called him in scorne and derision, Magnus with the
red mane.</p>
<p>The Scots hearing of the approch of this armie towards their borders, leuied a power:
<note place="marg">The earle of Ormont generall of the Scotish armie.</note>
George, or rather Hugh Dowglasse earle of Ormont by the kings commission, hauing the
conduction thereof, who vnderstanding that the enimies would enter into Annardale, drew
thither with the said armie to resist their attempts. The Englishmen passing ouer the riuer
<note place="marg">The English armie inuadeth Scotland.</note>
of Sulweie and Annand, came to another riuer called Sarc, &amp; there pitched downe their
tents. And on the next day they began to rob and spoile the countrie on ech side: but
aduertised that the Scots were at hand-with an armie, they that were thus gone foorth, were
with all sp&eacute;ed called backe to the campe by sound of trumpet, and foorthwith their armie
was brought into order of battell. Magnus with the red mane was appointed to lead the
right wing, and sir Iohn Penneinton a verie skilfull warriour gouerned the left wing, in the
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn Penneinton.</note>
which the Welshmen were placed. The battell or middle ward the earle of Northumberland himselfe ruled.</p>
<p>The earle of Ormont on the other side ordered his battels in this wise. He appointed a
verie valiant knight called Wallase of Craggie, with an hardie number of souldiers to 
<note place="marg">Wallase of Craggie.</note>
incounter with Magnus. And against the Welshmen he placed the lord Maxwell, and lord
Iohnston, with a chosen companie of lustie Scotishmen, and commanding himselfe in the
battell or middle ward, had scarse set his people in araie, when the trumpets in the English
armie began to sound to the battell. He therefore exhorting his men to doo valiantlie, put
<note place="marg">The earle of Ormont exhorteth his armie.</note>
them in remembrance that they had put on armor, being thereto prouoked by iniurie which
their enimies had first offered them, wherevpon they might conceiue good hope of victorie
by the fauour of the righteous God, who giueth the vpper hand (for the most part) to that
side that hath iust cause to make warre. He willed them then to put all feare out of their
harts; and as they had force inough to vanquish their enimies that came thus to brag and
threaten them with vtter destruction: so he besought them to shew no lesse manlike stomachs to deliuer their countrie by hardie fight from iniurie of the same enimies.</p>
<p>He had no sooner made an end of his speech, but that the arrowes came so thicke from
<note place="marg">The battell is begun.</note>
the English archers, that the Scots began to looke about them, as it were to s&eacute;e which waie
they might best escape by flight. But Wallase perceiuing their faintnesse of courage, with lowd
voice reprooued their cowardise, and with most pithie words exhorted them to remember
their duties, and to follow the example of him their leader, whome they should perceiue
to haue fullie vowed to spend his life in defense of his countrie. The Scots heerwith
seemed to be so incouraged, that they rushed forward with great egernesse vpon the right
wing of the Englishmen where Magnus stood, and so laied about them with speares, axes,
and such like hand weapons, that with great slaughter they draue the Englishmen to breake
araie and to flee: Magnus heerewith being more chafed than afraid, as should app&eacute;ere,
preassed forward vpon Wallase with great violence, and s&eacute;eking to approch vnto him that
he might haue wroken his griefe vpon him, was inclosed among the Scotish troopes, and
slaine with a few other of his friends and seruants that followed him.</p>
<note place="marg">Magnus is slaine.</note>
<p>The slaughter of this man, in whome consisted no small hope of victorie on the English
part, put the residue of their armie in such feare, that they were not able longer to resist the
Scotishmens violent impression, but turning their backs fled amaine, whom the Scots pursued in chase verie fiercelie, so that manie of the Englishmen died in the battell, but more
<note place="marg">The English men put to flight.</note>
now in the chase: for the tide being come in, staied manie of them that made their course
to haue escaped thorough the riuer, whereby diuerse that ventured into the water were
drowned; &amp; other that durst not take the water, were oppressed by the Scots that followed

<note place="marg">The number slaine.</note>
thousand, and amongest other, Magnus (as before ye haue heard) with eleuen other knights
of no small account and estimation. Of Scots were lost somewhat aboue six hundred.
There were taken prisoners of Englishmen sir Iohn Penneinton, and sir Robert Harington
<note place="marg">Prisoners taken.</note>

<note place="marg">The earle of Northumberland escapeth by flight.</note>
knights, and the lord Persie, sonne to the earle of Northumberland, who holpe his father to
horsbacke, whereby he escaped by flight: &amp; beside these, a great number of other were by
the Scots taken prisoners, whome the swoord and water had spared.</p>
<p>The earle of Ormont hauing got this honorable victorie, conueied the chiefest of the
prisoners to the castle of Lochmaben, and after repaired to the court, where he was of the
king ioifullie receiued, honorablie feasted, and highlie rewarded. After this, the Scots that
dwelled vpon the borders, liued for a season in better quiet: for though the Englishmen
wished to haue b&eacute;ene reuenged for this losse and ouerthrow of their people, yet by reson
of ciuill wars that shortlie after followed, they were constreined to forbeare to make anie
further wars against the Scots, till better occasion might serue. And for the auoiding of

danger that might insue in time of this intestine trouble by forren enimies, they sued to haue
a truce with the Scots, which for the terme of thr&eacute;e yeares was granted. In this yeare,
William earle of Dowglasse, with a great companie of nobles and gentlemen, as the lords
Hamilton, Graie, Salton, Seiton, and Oliphant; also, Calder, Vrquhart, Cambell, Frasier,
and Lauder, knights, went into Italie, and was at Rome in time of the Iubile which was
kept there that yeare. He left behind him to gouerne his lands in Scotland, Hugh earle of
Ormont that was his brother: but in his absence (by counsell of such as were about him)
the king summoned the erle to appeare before him within 40 daies; &amp; because he came
not within that set time, he was put to the horne, &amp; his lands inuaded &amp; spoiled.</p>
<p>*Wherevpon the king sent William Sentclare earle of Orcades at that time chancellor
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
first into Galloway, and then into Dowglasse, where he appointed collectors to take vp (to
the kings vse) the reuenues of the Dowglasse. But when Sentclare was not of sufficient
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan.</emph></note>
strength to performe what he would, because some &amp; the most part reiected (though others
imbraced) him, he returned home without dooing anie thing. Wherewith the king greatlie
moued (because he saw his authoritie contemned) called all the Dowglasses into law, and
declared them publike enimies and detractors of his gouernement. And therevpon (prouiding an armie against them) he goeth into Galloway: where, at their first comming (since
their capteins were all in prison) a small part of the armie (s&eacute;eing the enimies dispersed into
rougher parts of the countrie to hide themselues) turned backe to the king without anie
thing doone. Whereat the king highlie offended (in that such wandering th&eacute;eues should
so lightlie dare to contemne his power) followed them into their starting holes and caues,
and with no great labor tooke the castell of Lochmaben, reducing the countrie of Dowglasse
(with extreame labor of his soldiors) to his subiection, at what time he leuelled the castell
thereof equall with the ground.)</p>
<p>The earle aduertised hereof, with all sp&eacute;ed returned home through England, and sent
his brother Iames vnto the king, to know his pleasure: who commanding the earle to s&eacute;e
his countries (namele Annandale) purged of theeues and robbers, pardoned him of all
offenses, and receiued him into fauor againe, so that he was also eftsoones proclamed the
<note place="marg">The earle of Dowglasse goeth into England without licence of the king of Scots.</note>
kings lieutenant; but shortlie after going into England without the kings licence, to common
with the king of England about the recouerie of losses susteined by the Englishmen by certeine inrodes (as he alleged) the king tooke the matter in verie euill part, for that he
should s&eacute;eme so to be had in contempt of the earle: and withall he mistrusted also, least
there were some secret practises in hand to the prejudice of him and his realme: so that he
stormed not a little towards the earle. Who being thereof aduertised, came in humble wise
to the king, &amp; besought him of pardon, if he had in anie wise offended him, assuring him
<note place="marg">The earle of Dowglasse sueth for pardon.</note>
that from thencefoorth, he would neuer commit anie act that might tend to his maiesties
displeasure.</p>

pardon, so that in the end he was receiued againe into fauor, but yet discharged of bearing
anie publike office, which pinched him so sore (namelie for that his aduersaries William

king) that he sought to dispatch the chancellor, procuring certeine of his seruants and
friends to assault him on a morning as he was comming foorth of Edenburgh, but yet he
escaped to his castell of Chreichton, although wounded in d&eacute;ed right sore, and within few
daies after, gathering a power of his kinsmen, friends, &amp; alies, he returned againe to Edenburgh, and had destroied (as was thought) the earle of Dowglasse at that present, if he
<note place="marg">The Dowglasse constrained to fl&eacute;e out of Edenburgh.</note>

had not shifted away the more sp&eacute;edilie, who being thus to his great gr&eacute;efe, and no small
dishonor chased out of Edenburgh, deuised which way he might best be reuenged; and for
the more easie accomplishment of his purpose, he procured the earles of Crawford and Rosse
to ioine with him in that quarell against Chreichton and other his complices, by force of
which confederacie they couenanted to assist one another against the malice of the said
Chreichton, and all other their aduersaries.</p>

<note place="marg">The Lord Herres his lands spoiled.</note>
high, in presuming further thereof than stood with reason: and this was one great cause
of the kings displeasure now passinglie increased against the said earle. An other cause was
this: a sort of th&eacute;eues and robbers brake into the lands of the lord Iohn Herres, a noble
man, and one that had continued euer faithfull to the king, taking with them out of the
same lands a great bootie of cattell. And whereas the said lord Herres complained vnto
the earle of Dowglasse of that wrong, because the offendors were inhabiting within his roome,
and yet could haue no redresse; he attempted to fetch out of Annardale some preie, wherewith to satisfie in part the wrong which had b&eacute;ene offered him by those limmers and robbers.
But such was his euill hap, that taken he was with his retinue, and committed to prison,
and shortlie after by commandement of the earle of Dowglasse he was hanged as a fellon,
<note place="marg">The Lord Herres hanged.</note>
notwithstanding that the king by an herald commanded the contrarie.</p>
<p>The king being sore offended herewith (as he had no lesse cause) passed ouer his displeasure with silence, till he saw time and opportunitie to reuenge the same: but in the
meane season manie an honest man bought the bargaine right d&eacute;erelie, being spoiled of that
he had, and otherwise euill intreated, and yet durst not the meaner sort once complaine for
feare of further mischiefe: where the higher powers also sore lamented the great disorders
dailie increasing, and yet were not able in anie wise to reforme the same, insomuch as it
<note place="marg">The confederacie mistrusted.</note>
was greatlie doubted, least the earles of Dowglasse, Crawford, Rosse, Murrey, and other
of that faction ment to put the king beside his seat. Which dout being put into the kings
head, brought him into no small perplexitie, wherevpon by courteous messages he sent for
<note place="marg">The king sendeth for the earle of Dowglasse.</note>
the earle of Dowglasse, willing him to repaire to his presence, soiourning then in Striueling
castell, which he refused to doo, till he had assurance vnder the kings great seale for his
safe comming and going (as some haue said.) And then about Shrouetide in the yeare
1451, he came to the court of Striueling, where the king tooke him aside, &amp; in secret talke
<note place="marg"><date>1451.</date></note>
moued and requested him to forsake the league and bond of friendship betwixt him and the
earle of Crawford, and other such his confederats.</p>
<p>There was a secret murmuring amongst a number, that this earle of Dowglasse purposed
to make a proofe on a day to get the garland beside the kings head. In d&eacute;ed by reason
of his kinsmen and alies, he was of more puissance in the realme, than (as it was thought)
stood with the suertie of the kings estate, vnlesse he were the more faithfull. He had at
the same time two brothren that were also earles, as Archembald earle of Murrey, and

lords, knights, and men of great possessions and liuings, all of the same surname, and
lincked in friendship and aliance with other the chiefest linages of all the realme. Hereto
(by reason there had b&eacute;ene so manie valiant men and woorthie capteins of the Dowglasses

with them, they cared not whither, nor against whome. It is said, that the earles of Dowglasses might haue raised thirtie or fortie thousand warlike persons readie at their commandement, whensoeuer it had pleased them to call. In d&eacute;ed the Dowglasses had euer the gouernement of all matters perteining vnto the defense of the realme, so that the men of war
had them still in all the estimation and honor that might be.</p>

the earle of Dowglasse: it chanced in the end (vpon what occasion I know not) that the
earle answered the king somewhat ouerthwartlie, wherewith the king tooke such indignation,
that the earle herevpon was slaine by him, and such other as were there about him, on
Shroue &eacute;euen. Then after the earle was thus made awaie, his brethren made open warre
against the king, and slue all such of his friends and seruants, as they might incounter
with: insomuch that those which trauelled by the high waies, were in doubt to confesse whether they belonged to the king, or to the Dowglasses. The Lord of Cadzow being in the
towne of Striueling, with a great companie of the earl of Dowglasses friends, in reuenge of his
<note place="marg">Striueling is burnt.</note>
death incontinentlie burnt that towne, and did manie other great displeasures to the king and
his subiects, setting foorth proclamations against the king and his councell, for the violating
of the assurance granted (as before is said) to the earle of Dowglas.</p>
<p>*And that with such despite, as in the 6 kalends of Aprill, binding a woodden trunchion

to an horsse taile, they fasten therto the safe conduct of the king and the nobles, which
they forbeare not to traile vp and downe the str&eacute;ets (not sparing to reuile the king) with
bitter and heauie words of contumelie and exclamation. With which not satisfied, when
they were come into the market place, they did with the noise of fiue hundred hornes,
and by the mouth of a crier, proclame the king and all such as were about him, faithbreakers, periured, and such persons as were to be denounced enimies of all goodnesse and good
men. And yet supposing this not a sufficient reuenge to quench the furie of their rebellious
minds, they run with like rage, and with like order doo spoile the countries &amp; possessions of all
such as tooke part with the king, and stedfastlie remained in the execution of their obedient
dutie. For they besieged the castell of Dalketh, binding themselues (as coniured and periured enimies of all vertue) not to depart from thence, before they had taken and spoiled the
same, being grieuouslie offended with Iohn the lord of that place, bicause that he with the
earle of Angus had seuered themselues from the opinion &amp; faction of the Dowglasses, whose
furie (growing still to extremitie) found such support (by the inclining multituds) that
the king was put to his shifts) that he was determined to haue left the realme, and to haue
<note place="marg">The king would haue fled.</note>
fled by sea into France, had not Iames Kenedie the bishop of saint Andrews caused him
to staie, on the hope he had of assistance onelie by the earle of Huntleie, which earle hearing that the Dowglasses had gathered an armie in the south against the king, raised an other
armie in the north to aid the king.</p>
<p>On the other side the earle of Crawford, hauing assembled a great power, incountered
him at Breithune, in purpose to stop the earle of Huntleies passage, where betwixt them was
fought a sore battell, and the earle of Crawford chased into Finwin, so that manie noble
men, gentlemen, and commons were slaine, and amongest other the earle of Crawfords brother was one. Hector Boetius writeth, that Iohn Cullace of Bannamwin, whome the earle of
<note place="marg">Cullace of Bannamwin betraieth the erle of Crawford.</note>
Crawford had appointed to lead them that bare the battell axes, or (as I maie terme them)
the bilmen, in the left wing of his armie, fled of purpose in the hotest of the fight, &amp; so left
the midle ward naked on the one side of the chiefest aid that the said earle had, and so the
victorie by that meanes onelie inclined to the kings standard, which the earle of Huntleie had
<note place="marg">The earle of Huntleie victorer.</note>
there with him. But howsoeuer it was, the said erle of Huntleie had the honor of the field,
who neuerthelesse lost diuerse of his men also, though nothing so manie as his aduersaries
did. This battell was fought the eight&eacute;enth of Maie, being the Ascension day, 1452.</p>

valiantlie. In recompense wherof the king gaue to the said earle the lands of Badzenot &amp;
Lochquhaber. In the meane time, Archembald Dowglas earle of Murrey burnt the peill
<note place="marg">The earle of Murrey.</note>
of Straboggie, perteining to the erle of Huntleie, and haried the lands thereabouts. In
reuenge wherof, the erle of Huntleie at his returning backe, burnt &amp; haried all the lands
of the earledome of Murrey. In the meane time, at a parlement holden at Edenburgh,
<note place="marg">The earle of Crawford forfaited.</note>

<note place="marg">Lords cited to appeare.</note>
the earle of Crawford was denounced a traitor, and all his lands and goods deemed to be
forfeited into the kings hands. Iames earle of Dowglas, Iames lord Hammilton, the earles of
Murrey, and Ormont, the lord of Baluay, and manie other of that faction, were by publike
proclamation made by an herald, commanded to appeare by a day to vnderlie the law. But
in the next night that followed the day of this proclamation, certeine of the Dowglasses seruants that were sent priuilie to Edenburgh, to vnderstand what was doone there, fastened 
<note place="marg">Writings set vp in c&omacr;tempt of the king.</note>
writings vpon the church doores, seeled with the Dowglasses seale in this forme. The earle
from hencefoorth will neither obeie citation, nor other commandement. Beside this, in the
same writings, they charged the king with manie heinous crimes, calling him a murtherer,
periured, false, and a bloudsucker.</p>
<p>The king therefore assembled an armie, and went foorth against them: but bicause the
time of the y&eacute;ere was contrarie to his purpose, he could doo no great hurt to his enimies, although he burnt vp their corne and droue awaie their cattell. But the Dowglas s&eacute;emed to
passe little for the kings malice, and the erle himselfe maried his brothers wife the countesse

Beatrice, &amp; sent to Rome for a licence to haue that mariage made lawfull: but by the kings
agents in that court, the earles sute might not be obteined. Neuerthelesse, he kept hir still
in place of his wife, and continuing in rebellion against the king, the next spring, and for the
more part of the tearme of two y&eacute;eres next insuing, he haried and spoiled the kings possessions; and the king on the other part wasted Annandale, and all other the lands and possessions that belonged to the said earle of Dowglas or his friends: but shortlie after, as the king
passed through Angus, to go into the north parts of the realme, the earle of Crawford came

and submitted himselfe vnto him, crauing mercie in most humble and lamentable wise, and
obteined the kings pardon thorough mediation of Iames Kenedie bishop of saint Andrews, and
sir William Creichton; but the said earle liued not past six moneths after, departing this life
by force of an hot ague in the y&eacute;ere 1454.</p>
<p>The same y&eacute;ere, the king called a parlement at Edenburgh, in the which Iames earle of
Dowglas, and his brothers wife the countesse Beatrice (whome he had taken to him by waie
of a pretensed &amp; feined mariage) Archembald Dowglas earle of Murrey, George Dowglas
earle of Ormont, and Iohn Dowglas baron of Baluay, were forfalted &amp; condemned of treason.
The earledome of Murrey was giuen to sir Iames Creichton, or rather restored to him from
whome it had b&eacute;ene wrongfullie taken by the vniust sentence of William earle of Dowglas,
who had procured it to be assigned vnto his brother the forsaid Archembald, though the
right remained in the said sir Iames Creichton. But yet when the said sir Iames Creichton
could not k&eacute;epe that earldome without enuie of diuerse and sundrie persons, h&eacute;e handled
the matter so, that shortlie after it returned againe to the kings hands. Moreouer at this 
<note place="marg">Creations of noble men.</note>
parlement, George Creichton was created erle of Cathnesse, &amp; William Haie constable of Scotland was made earle of Erroll. There were also diuerse created lords of the parlement, whose
titles were as follow; Darlie, Halis, Boid, Lile, and Lorne. After the breaking vp of
the parlement, the king made a iournie against his aduersaries into Galloway, and with small
adoo brought all the castels of that countrie into his possession, and then turning into

he gaue likewise counsell without delaie, to set vpon the king, that the matter might b&eacute;e
tried by chance of battell, the onelie meane to assure them of their liues and estates, for otherwise he saw not how anie vnfeined agreement might be concluded, the matter being now
passed so farre foorth to an extremitie. But the earle of Dowglas vtterlie (as some write) 
<note place="marg"><emph>Io. Maior.</emph></note>
refused to fight against his souereigne and true liege lord, if any other meane might be found.
Wherevpon diuerse great lords which were with him there on his side, being men of great
wit, and no lesse experience, aduised him yet to keepe togither his host, till by their trauell
and assistance a peace were concluded, and pardon obteined for all parts: for if the armie
were once broken vp, all hope was then past (as they alledged) for anie indifferent conditions of peace to be obteined.</p>
<p>Herewith also, the lord Hammilton being wiser than the residue, bad the Dowglas farewell,
<note place="marg">The lord Hammilton departeth from the Dowglas.</note>
and so departed, concluding that he should neuer s&eacute;e so faire a day againe, wherein he might
haue cast the dice for the whole kingdome. And being thus departed from the Dowglas,
he repaired to the king as then lieng at the siege of Abircorne, who sent him to the castell
of Rosleine, there to remaine vnder safe k&eacute;eping with the earle of Orkenie, to whom the
said castell belonged: but at length, the king did not onlie pardon the lord H&amacr;milton of all
passed offenses, but also receiued him into such fauor, that he gaue him his eldest daughter
in mariage, as after shall appeare. But now vpon the withdrawing thus of the said lord
<note place="marg">The earle of Dowglas his companie shrinketh from him.</note>

<note place="marg">He withdraweth into England.</note>
Hammilton from the Dowglas, bicause the king had set foorth an open proclamation of pardon to all those that would forsake the earle of Dowglas, the most part of the same earles companie departed from him, by reason whereof he fled into England, togither with his brethren.
The king lieng at the siege of Abircorne, lost diuerse of his men, besides manie that were
wounded; but yet taking first a strong tower, being one of the chiefest limmes of that fortresse, shortlie after hee wan the rest.</p>
<p>The earle of Dowglas being withdrawne (as y&eacute;e haue heard) into England, within a

Scotland by the west borders, in hope to find friends in those parties: but such as the king

prisoner, being first sore wounded. The baron of Baluay escaped into a wood, and so got
away. The earle himselfe also (as Hector Boetius saith) escaped by flight, and got vnto
Dunstafage, where finding Donald earle of Rosse and lord of the Iles, he procured him
(being of nature inclined and readie inough to follow such counsell) to make warre in his
fauour against the king. And after he had once set him on worke, he got him backe againe
into England. Donald wasted not onelie the kings possessions that lay n&eacute;ere to Dunstafage, but also passing through Argile, did much hurt in all places where he came. He
inuaded also the Ile of Arrane, and chased the bishop of Lismore, constreining him to take
sanctuarie. This doone, he entered into Lochquhabir, and so into Murrey land, where he
burnt the towne of Inuernes, and wan the castell by a guilefull traine.</p>
<p>In the meane time, the earle of Ormont after he was recouered of his hurts (as the
said Boetius writeth) was presented to the king, and after he had remained in prison
a certeine time, he was at length beheaded. Moreouer the countesse Beatrice, after

she saw no hope left that the earle of Dowglas should recouer his former estate, came

receiued hir right courteouslie, and gaue to hir the baronie of Baluay, to mainteine therwith hir estate. Shortlie after also the countesse of Rosse fled from hir husband, &amp; came
to the king for feare of hir husbands crueltie, wherof partlie she had alreadie tasted. The

die for their wicked offense committed. The vniuersitie of Glascow was founded about this

time by one Turnbull, bishop of that see. In the yeere following, died William Haie earle
of Erroll, and constable of Scotland: also George Creichton earle of Catnes, and William
Creichton chiefe of that familie.</p>
<p>In this meane while, the earle of Dowglas remaining in England, procured the Englishmen diuers times to make rodes into Scotland, wherby he lost (as the Scotish writers affirme) the loue of his owne countrimen, when they saw him thus ioine with the Englishmen, to the damage of his natiue land. At one time, Henrie earle of Northumberland, and
the said earle of Dowglas inuaded the Mers, but taking little h&eacute;ed to themselues, and suffering their people to ride abrode to harie the countrie without order; Dowglas earle of Angus with a mightie armie of Scotishmen set vpon them, and put them to flight, sleaing diuers, and taking to the number of seuen hundred prisoners. Thus (as should appeare) the
earle of Dowglas in vain sought to disquiet his countrie, for all his friends in Scotland continued faithfull to the king, who had granted peace to all other of the Dowglasses and their
complices: for it was Gods will the matter should be taken vp without more bloudshed,
that the right line of the Scotish kings might be preserued. [For (as it appeareth) he was
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 8. <emph>pag.</emph> 305.</note>
amongst the English inuading Scotland, subdued and taken by the barons Iohnston and
Cokpull, who presented him vnto the king, wherevpon the king after a sort banished him into
the monasterie of Lendore, where he was bountifullie and honorablie receiued (according to
his nobilitie) of the religious persons, in which place he liued manie yeeres, and then died.]</p>
<p>And though the almightie God might haue brought that to passe by other meanes, according as it should haue pleased his good will and omnipotent power; yet he chose this way,
whereby the effussion of much bloud might be auoided, which by ciuill battell had b&eacute;ene
spilled, if the parties hauing their harts filled with rancor &amp; ire, had buckled togither in battell. But the K. vsing the aduise of his kinsman Iames Kenedie archbishop of S. Andrews,
<note place="marg">Iames Kenedie archbish of S. Andrews, ch&eacute;efe chancellor to the king.</note>
compassed his purpose in the end, dispatching out of the way such as he anie waies foorth
mistrusted, of which number namelie were the Dowglasses, whose puissance and authoritie
not without cause he euermore suspected. Many haue reported (as before is said) that in
the beginning king Iames the second, through feare of the great power of these Dowglasses,
was in mind to haue fled the realme, but being recomforted by the counsell and authoritie
of the said bishop Iames Kenedie, he aduanced his studie to matters of greater importance.</p>
<p>The said Kenedie turned the earle of Angus, being of the surname of the Dowglasses,
<note place="marg">The practise of bishop Kenedie.</note>
and brother to him by his mother, to take part with the king. He procured also diuers
other of the same bloud and surname, to reuolt from the other confederats, and to submit
themselues vpon promise of pardon vnto the kings mercie; and so infeebling the forces of
such as were aduersaries to the king, in the end he had them all at his pleasure. It was
<note place="marg">Great power cause of suspicion.</note>
thought, that forsomuch as the Dowglasses had their lands lieng so vpon the west and middle
marches of the realme, (that no man might beare anie rule in those parts, but onelie they
themselues) if they had happilie ioined with the Englishmen, considering the great intelligence
beside, which they had in all other parts of the realme, what by kinred and aliance, the
realme might haue fallen into great perill: for truiie it is a dangerous thing (as Io. Maior
saith) for the estate of a realme to haue men of great power and authoritie inhabiting on
the borders and vttermost parts therof. For if they chance (vpon anie occasion giuen) to renounce their obedience to their naturall prince &amp; supreme gouernor, the preiudice may be
great and irrecouerable, that oftentimes thereof insueth; as well appeareth in the earles of
March, and other before mentioned in this historie: and likewise in France by the duke of
Burgognie, Britaine, and Normandie: for till those countries were incorporated and annexed
vnto the crowne of France, the kings of that realme were oftentimes put to great hinderance
through rebellion by them, whome they accounted for their subiects.</p>
<p>But now to returne where I left. After the Dowglasses were once dispatched, and things
quieted, King Iames the second began then to reigne and rule reallie, not doubting the

controlment of anie other person. For then he ordeined lawes for his people as seemed best to
<note place="marg">Lawes ordeined.</note>
his liking, commanding the same to be kept vnder great penalties and forfeitures. And
being counselled chieflie by the bishop of saint Andrews, Iames Kenedie that was his vncle,
and the earle of Orkenie, he passed through all the parts of his realme, granting a generall
<note place="marg">A generall pardon granted.</note>
pardon of all offenses passed. And so he ruled and gouerned his subiects in great quietnesse,
and caused iustice so dulie to be ministred on all sides, that it was said in his daies, how
he caused the rash bush to k&eacute;epe the cow. In the y&eacute;ere 1455, the king held a 
<note place="marg"><date>1455.</date></note>

<note place="marg">A parlement holden.</note>

<note place="marg">The Iles &amp; high land quietlie gouerned.</note>
parlement, in which were manie good lawes made and established for the weale of all the realme,
as in the bookes of the acts of parlement is conteined. He vsed the matter also in such wise
with the principall capteins of the Iles, and of the hie lands, that the same were as quietlie gouerned, as anie part of the low lands, shewing all obedience as well in paieng such duties as
they owed to the king for their lands, as also in readinesse to serue in the warres with great
companies of men, as became them to doo: speciallie Donald lord of the Iles and earle of
<note place="marg">Donald earle of Rosse, and lord of the Iles.</note>
Rosse, who had before ioined himselfe in confederacie with the earles of Dowglas and
Crawford against the king, and had taken into his hands the kings house, and castell of
Inuernesse (as before ye haue heard) naming himselfe king of the Iles.</p>
<p>Neuerthelesse, he was now at length reconciled to the king, and gaue pledges for his
good demeanor, and afterwards brought to the king three thousand men in aid at the siege
of Roxburgh, * whose reconciliation was after this maner. When this Donald perceiued 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 11.</note>
aduerse fortune to besiege him on euerie side, he sent messengers to the king, crauing peace
and pardon for himselfe and for his offenses. Who comming before the king (and with manie humble sp&eacute;eches, remembring the manie parts of clemencie which the king had vsed to
the earle of Crawford, and such as followed his faction) they did so purge the fault of Donald (by transferring the same to the fatall rage and iniurie of the present times, and by
promising in his behalfe that hereafter he should liue most quietlie in dutifull obedience) that
they mooued the kings mind to haue compassion vpon him.</p>
<p>But yet the king answered in a meane sort betw&eacute;ene both, not vtterlie pardoning, nor flatlie reiecting him: "for (saith he) there be yet manie shewes extant of his wickednesse, and
he hath not giuen foorth anie one token of a changed mind. Wherefore, to the end that
we may bel&eacute;eue the same to be true (which you haue promised in his behalfe) heereafter
to become a dutifull subiect and louing neighbour to vs, and to those which are about him,
he must with repentance (proc&eacute;eding from an vnfeined toong) craue pardon from vs whome
he hath greeuouslie offended, and (with sufficient restitution) recompense those whome (by
spoiling) he had iniured: besides which also, he must with some woorthie exploit wipe
awaie the memorie and blot of all his former committed wickednes. And although I well

so to prouide, that (measuring all things by the line of reason) the wicked wax not so proud

Lancaster &amp; Yorke; the king being principall of the house of Lancaster, was taken himselfe at the
battell of saint Albons. But the queene with hir sonne the prince, and Henrie the yoong

reuenge of his vncle the duke of Summerset his death, prepared an armie of twentie thousand
men to passe into England: and in the meane time all the north parts of England, hearing
that king Iames was readie to support the qu&eacute;ene of England, ioined with hir, and past
forward into the south parts, constreining the duke of Yorke to fl&eacute;e the realme, and so king
Henrie inioied the gouernement of his realme againe, and for that time concluded an agreement with the duke of Yorke his aduersarie; which lasted not long.</p>
<p>The duke of Yorke remembring how readie king Iames was to prepare an armie in support of his aduersarie king Henrie, procured the borderers to make incursions vpon the Scotish subiects, &amp; would suffer no redresse to be had, nor daies of truce to be kept on the borders, as in time of peace the custome was. Wherevpon king Iames raised a power, and in

person entered with the same into England, dooing great hurt by destroieng diuers townes,
castels and peiles in Northumberland, the bishoprike and other parts, till at length vpon faire
promises made by the Englishmen, he returned into his owne countrie. [At this time,

Lesleus.]</p>
<p>After this, king Henrie of England, perceiuing that the duke of Yorke by the counsell
of the earle of Warwike, ceassed not to practise conspiracies against him, sent eftsoones to king
Iames, requiring him of aid against them, and promised therefore to restore vnto the king of
Scotland the lands in Northumberland, Cumberland, the bishoprike of Duresme, and such
like, which the kings of Scotland had held before. This offer was accepted, and by treaties
and contracts accorded, sealed, and interchanged betwixt the two princes (as the Scotishmen

qu&eacute;ene in the meane time had slaine the duke of Yorke, &amp; got the vpper hand of hir enimies, at the same qu&eacute;enes request, he retired into Scotland againe. Neuerthelesse shortlie
after, when the earles of March and Warwike sought still to mainteine their quarrell against
the qu&eacute;ene of England, she was constreined to withdraw into the north parts, and to desire
<note place="marg"><date>1460.</date></note>
king Iames to approch eftsoones with his armie vnto the borders: which he did, meaning to
win the castels of Rocksburgh and Warke, which were amongest other things promised to
be deliuered vnto him by king Henrie, and so comming to Rocksburgh, laied his armie
round about that castell, and planted his siege in full warlike manner.</p>
<p>H&eacute;ere the king hauing great experience in knowledge of shooting great artillerie, departed
from his campe, accompanied with the earle of Angus, and others, and came to the trenches
where the great ordinance was planted, which he caused to be shot off. And h&eacute;ere by great

<p>In time of warre, amongest his subiects in the campe, he behaued himselfe so gentlie towards all men, that they s&eacute;emed not to feare him as their king, but to reuerence &amp; loue

<p>* All the time of the reigne of this king, christian religion did greatlie flourish amongest
the Scots: for there were amongest them twelue notable and famous bishops, whereof the
chiefest were Iames Kennedie bishop of saint Andrewes, Turnebull bishop of Glascow,
Thomas Spenser bishop of Aberden, and Henrie Lichton bishop of Murrey. At what time
likewise there were manie religious abbats that kept such great houses, as both the nobilitie
and communaltie trauelling through out the kingdome, did neuer almost lodge in anie publike hosterie, but in the monasteries: which were neuer vexed or spoiled, during the time of
the ciuill warres of the kingdome. Beside these men of eminent learning, there flourished
also Nicholas Deidone, and Iohn Eldmaire, singular diuines, with manie other doctors laudablie seene in all kind of learning. In the reigne of which king also, Charles the 7, king of
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 8. <emph>pag.</emph> 300.</note>
France, for singular seruice doone vnto him by the Scots, in the warres (betw&eacute;ene the English and the French) did honorablie indow manie of the Scots (for recompense thereof) with
manie rich possessions in Aquitaine, who by that meanes (setling themselues in that countrie) were the originall of manie woorthie families of that prouince, amongest which is that
famous kinred of Caldell de la Campania in Tolouse, at this time greatlie flourishing, which
had his beginning from Caldell a thane (or baron) being knight in the north parts of Scotland: for the grandfather of him which is now liuing, head of that house, did inioy the place
of magistrat or ruler of the Capitoline in that citie, hauing that title confirmed to his posteritie. This mans sonne Peter Caldell being a senator in the high court of Tolouse (commonlie called the parlement) was for his singular learning and wisedome had in great honor
of all men during his life, which stretched to extreame age. In whose place came Iohn
(the eldest sonne of the said Peter) who dooth at this day possesse the roome of his father,
as a senator of the said court of Tolouse. And his other children with great honor are indued with other offices of gouernement in the said citie.)</p>
<p>Some strange sights there app&eacute;ered before the death of this king Iames the second: for
the day before he was slaine, a blazing star was plainlie s&eacute;ene, which signified (as was
<note place="marg">A blasing starre.</note>

<note place="marg">An hermophrodyt, that is, a person being both man and woman.</note>
thought) the death of the said king. In the y&eacute;ere before the siege, there was in Dundee an
hermophrodyt, that is, a person with both shapes, but est&eacute;emed for a woman onelie, till it
was prooued, that lieng with hir maisters daughter nightlie where she dwelt, she had got the
yoong damsell with child; for the which act, because she had counterfeited hir selfe a woman, and yet had wrought the part of a man, she was condemned to be buried quicke, and
suffered according to that iudgement. At the same time, there was a certeine theefe, that with
<note place="marg">A wicked th&eacute;efe that vsed to kill yoong persons and to eat them.</note>
his familie liued apart from the companie of men, remaining secretlie within a den in Angus
called Fenisden, who vsed to kill yoong persons, and to f&eacute;ed on their flesh, for the which
abhominable offense, being apprehended with his wife and all his familie, they were burnt to
death. One of his daughters that was scarse twelue moneths of age, onelie excepted, the
which being preserued and brought vp in Dund&eacute;e, before she came to the age of twelue
<note place="marg">His daughter falleth to the like practise.</note>
y&eacute;eres, she was taken in the like crime for the which hir father died, wherevpon she was
iudged to be buried quicke: and going to execution, when the people in great multitudes
followed hir, in woondering at so horrible an offense committed by one of hir age and sexe,
she turned to them that thus detested hir wicked dooing, and with a countenance representing
hir cruell inclination, said to them: What n&eacute;ed you thus to raile vpon me, as if I had
<note place="marg">Hir words going to execeution.</note>
doone an heinous act contrarie to the nature of man? I tell you, that if you knew how pleasant mans flesh is intaste, there would none of you all forbeare to eat it. And thus with an

but rather in comforting the lords whose part had bin to haue comforted hir: and aboue all
things she exhorted them with all diligence to imploie their whole indeuors and forces to the
winning of that castell. Whose words so incouraged the capteins and whole armie, that the

siege was continued till the castell was woone, raced, and beaten downe flat to the ground:
and the yoong king was crowned at Kelso, with the vniuersall consent and great reioising of
all the noble men, and other being there present in the armie.</p>
<p>This doone, they besieged the castell of Warke, which likewise they tooke, and threw

<note place="marg">Seuen gouernors chosen.</note>
order for the quiet gouernement of the realme. And because the king was yoong, there
were chosen seuen regents to gouerne both king &amp; realme, as these, the qu&eacute;ene his mother,
Iames Kenedie bishop of S. Andrews, that was sisters sonne to Iames the first, the bishop of
Glascow, the earles of Angus, Huntleie, Argile, and Orkeneie. These, so long as Iames
Kenedie liued, agr&eacute;ed well togither about the gouernement of the realme; but within a
while after his deceasse, they fell at square, or rather before, as appeareth by Hector Boetius,
who saieth, that in the second y&eacute;ere of this kings reigne, there was discord in brewing betwixt the qu&eacute;ene and the archbishop Kenedie, who perceiuing that the woman sought to
vsurpe wholie the gouernement vnto hir selfe, withstood hir in that behalfe, in so much that
it was doubted least the matter would haue broken foorth into some ciuill warre, if the
bishops of Glascow, Dunkeld, and Aberden, and certeine abbats had not taken in hand to
trauell betwixt the parties for an attonement, who did so much in the matter, that they compounded the variance in this wise.</p>
<p>The qu&eacute;ene mother was appointed to haue the charge of the kings person, and of his
brethren, Alexander duke of Albanie, and Iohn earle of Mar, and likewise of his two sisters;
but as for the administration and gouernance of the realme, she should leaue it vnto the
peeres. There were therefore elected by common consent as rulers, the bishops of Glascow
and Dunkeld, the earle of Orkeneie, the lord Graham, Thomas Boid, and the chancellor.
About the same time, one Alane Keir, in hope to get the heritage of his brother, Iohn lord
of Lorne tooke him, and kept him in prison. But Colen Campbell earle of Argile, taking
great indignation with so presumptuous a part, gathered a power, and comming against
Keir, tooke him, and set his brother at libertie, and brought the offendor vnto Edenburgh,
where he died in prison. Moreouer, shortlie after Donald lord of the Iles and earle of Rosse,
<note place="marg">Donald of the Iles eftsoones rebelleth.</note>
who had serued obedientlie in the armie at Roxburgh, and was (as outwardlie appeared)

<p>To represse his iniurious attempts, the regents togither were preparing an armie; but
therewith came true aduertisements, that the said lord of the Iles, and other the principall
offendors of his companie, were stricken through the hand of God with a certeine frensie
or madnesse, and had lost all their ships and spoiles in the sea, so that the earle of Atholl

1461, Henrie the sixt king of England being vanquished by his aduersarie Edward the
fourth, purchased of king Iames the third a safe conduct for himselfe and a thousand horsse
to enter into Scotland; and herevpon he came to Edenburgh, and was lodged in the house
of the friers preachers, with his wife queene Margaret, and his sonne prince Edward.

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan.</emph></note>
(by birth and nature) began to intreat of a mariage (hoping by affinitie to establish that
perfect amitie) to be solemnized betweene the daughter of Iames the second king of Scots,
and the sonne of Henrie (king of England) being called prince of Wales, although none of
them as yet was aboue seuen yeares old. Which mariage, Philip duke of Burgognie (vncle
to the qu&eacute;ene of Scots, and deadlie enimie to the qu&eacute;ene of England) labored by all means
to hinder, by his ambassador Gruthusius, a noble man and of great iudgement; for this
Philip did vse such bitter enimitie against Reinold, grandfather to the son of king Henrie
by the mothers side, that he did d&eacute;epelie enuie anie good successe to happen to anie of that
race, whereby it might increase or florish; and therefore sought occasion by all deuise to
hinder it: for whose cause, and at whose request, the said mariage was at that time rather
deferred, than vtterlie broken off. But the end thereof (which was greatlie feared by this
Philip to be the consummation of the mariage) was by the aduerse fortune of king Henrie
vtterlie disappointed. For (as after shall appeare) this Henrie being incouraged (by the
beneuolence of the Scots towards him) and throughlie confirmed (by the letters of his
friend sent vnto him) dispatched his wife into France to Reinold hir father, to procure
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene went into France for aid.</note>
what aid she could of hir friends beyond the seas, to helpe to restore him to the kingdome:
which iournie succe&eacute;eded not to hir in vaine, obteining succor from thence.)</p>
<p>The same time, king Henrie deliuered the towne &amp; castell of Berwike into the Scotishmens
<note place="marg">Berwike deliuered to the Scotishmen.</note>
hands, whether by couenant thereby to haue the foresaid safe conduct granted, or of his
own voluntarie will, to the end he might haue the more support and fauor amongest them,
it is vncerteine by the variable report of writers. Neuerthelesse, shortlie after a truce was
<note place="marg">A truce for 15 yeares.</note>
taken betwixt king Iames and king Edward, for the tearme of fift&eacute;ene yeares, vpon wha
conditions or promises made on king Edwards part I find not. This truce was concluded
in the moneth of Maie, in the yeare 1462, at the citie of Yorke, whither had bin sent the

bishop of Glascow, the earle of Argile, k&eacute;eper of the priuie seale, the abbat of Holie rood

<p>All things in this season were ordered in Scotland by the aduise and counsell of Iames
<note place="marg">Iames Kenedie the archbishop gouerneth the realme.</note>
Kenedie bishop of saint Andrews, a man of great wisedome and poicie, as well appeared in

against king Edward. This Brezeie was one most in fauour with king Charles the seuenth,
father vnto the said king Lewes, and therefore (as manie did suppose) he was appointed by
K. Lewes (who greatlie loued him not) to be chiefe in this iourneie, to the end his life might
be put in hazard and aduenture; notwithstanding, after some danger both of tempest on

to the castell about the middest of the day, tooke the Frenchmen away with him into Scotland: the English armie that lay there at siege beholding the maner, and not once making
profer to fight with him. Some Englishmen there were, that would faine haue fought with
the Scots; but other (whose counsell was followed) were otherwise minded, alledging that
better it were to let them passe without incounter, sith they left the castell void, than to
leopard vpon the doubtfull chance of battell, for though their number were not great, yet
were they piked and chosen men, able to atchiue a great enterprise.</p>

who perceiuing himselfe in what danger he stood if he tooke land, returned backe into Denmarke, taking his wife with him.</p>
<p>The king herewith was so offended, that he caused both the said earle and his father to
be attainted of high treason, and sent for his sister backe into Scotland, causing a diuorse in
absence of hir husband to be sued &amp; gotten foorth against them, marieng hir afterwards to

had in gift before. Of this mariage, those of the house of Hamiltons are descended, &amp; are
n&eacute;erest of bloud to the crowne of Scotland, as they pretend. [For (as saith Lesleus, lib. 8.

the afore remembred Thomas Boid, Giouan Ferrerie, in his appendix of the Scotish historie
annexed vnto Hector Boetius lastlie printed at Paris in the yeare 1574, agreeth not with
that which ye haue red before. For as he telleth the tale, the said lord Boid being one of
the gouernors of the realme, elected thereto (as before ye haue heard) within short time grew
<note place="marg">The lord Boid beareth all the rule about the king.</note>
so far in fauor with the king, that he might doo all things with him at his pleasure, although
his associats in authoritie did neuer so much go about to hinder his deuises: by reason
whereof, he s&eacute;emed to vsurpe the whole rule &amp; administration of the realme into his owne
hands, sore to the griefe of those his said associats being ioined with him in like office.</p>
<p>Hereof the state of the common-wealth through the dissention thus bred among the
<note place="marg">Through default of agr&eacute;ement in the gouernors, euill disposed men wax bold to woorke mischiefe.</note>
gouernors, was brought into a miserable plight; for iustice in most places wanted hir due
course, so as th&eacute;eues and robbers taking boldnesse thereof, not onelie vpon the borders,
but also elsewhere, began to exercise great outrage, to the breach of publike peace, and
namelie the inhabitants of the out Iles fell to their woonted trade of pilfering, so that passing ouer in their long boats or barges, and landing here &amp; there on the shore, they tooke
preies of cattell and other goods, greatlie to their profit, and no lesse damage of the people
that inhabited on the coasts ouer against them. In the north parts also, seditious tumuits
amongest the nobles, gentlemen, and people were raised, to the great disquieting of the
whole countrie. Such disorders continued no small time, and because the said Thomas
lord Boid bare greatest rule about the king, the blame (as it commonlie happeneth) was
imputed to him.</p>
<p>At length, when the king was growen to ripe yeares, aud able to s&eacute;e to the administration
<note place="marg">They that be in authoritie be euer subiect to the spitefull blow of enuies dart.</note>
of the common-wealth himselfe, he was admonished by certeine graue personages to haue
some regard, that such misorders as disquieted the whole state of the realme, might be reformed. Herevpon he called a parlement, in the which, whether through enuie that the
lords had conceiued against the lord Boid, or for that his dooings no lesse deserued such
complaint, was exhibited by generall voices of the stats against him, that it was decreed by
authoritie of the whole assemblie, that he should come to answer in iudgement such crimes
<note place="marg">The lord Boid is accused.</note>

<note place="marg">He refuseth to be tried by way of arrainment.</note>
wherewith he was charged; but when he refused so to doo, and in contempt of the kings
authoritie got togither a power of armed men to defend him from iniurie, that might s&eacute;eme
(as he pretended) to be offered him: at length, the king was driuen of necessitie to make
preparation for the leuieng of an armie to apprehend him by force. Whereof Boid being
<note place="marg">He fl&eacute;eth into England.</note>
aduertised, fled into England, because he perceiued himselfe not able to resist the kings
power. The king assured that he was thus auoided out of his realme, banished him for
euer, and seized vpon his lands and goods as forfeited.</p>
<p>After this, when the said Boid saw no hope to returne againe into the kings fauor, and
finding no great comfort among the Englishmen, he passed from thence into Denmarke,
<note place="marg">He passeth into Denmarke.</note>
where he remained till the mariage was concluded betwixt the king, and the ladie Margaret,

vnderstanding by his wife that came to him on shipboord before he set foot on land, that
the kings displeasure continued still towards him so greatlie, that if he came on land, he
should be sure to lose his head, he returned into Denmarke, and tooke his wife with him;
as before is mentioned. Finallie he went into Italie, where at length he was murthered by

was diuorsed from his wife the kings sister, he begat on hir a sonne, the which in the daies
of king lames the fourth, in a priuat quarrell that rose betwixt him and an other noble

<p>The ambassadors that were sent vnto Christierne king of Denmarke &amp; Norwaie in the
<note place="marg"><date>1468.</date></note>

<note place="marg">The ambassadors sent vnto Denmarke as Ferrerio saith.</note>
yeare 1468, as the said Ferrerio affirmeth, were these; Andrew bishop of Glascow, William
bishop of Orkeneie, Andrew lord of Anandale chancellor of the realme, Martine Wane the
great almoner, &amp; the kings confessor, Gilbert de Kericke archdeacon of Glascow, Dauid
Creichton of Crauston, &amp; Iohn Shaw of Halie. These ambassadors being dispatched into
Denmarke in Iulie, in the yeare aforesaid, came at length to Haffnen, where K. Christierne
then remained, and were of him ioifullie receiued, &amp; well heard concerning their sute, in so
much at length, after he had proponed the matter to his councell about the eight of September, it was agr&eacute;ed in this sort, that the ladie Margaret, daughter to the said king Christierne,
should be giuen in mariage vnto K.lames of Scotland, and that the Iles of Orkeneie, being
<note place="marg">The mariage concluded.</note>

<note place="marg">The Iles of Orkeneie and Shetland ingaged.</note>
in number 28, and likewise the Iles of Shetland, of which there are eighteene, should remaine in possession of the kings of Scotland, till either the said king Christierne or his successors in name of the mariage monie should pay vnto king Iames, or to his successors, the
summe of fiftie thousand florens of the Rheine. This mariage was thought, by reason of
this ingaging of those Iles, right profitable vnto the realme of Scotland, because of the controuersie and variance which had continued long before those daies betwixt the kings of
Scotland and Denmarke, about the right of possessing those Iles.</p>
<p>In the moneth of Nouember next insuing, after the mariage had b&eacute;ene consummate in

lulie before, within the abbeie church of Holie rood house (as before ye haue heard) or in

the king and qu&eacute;ene made their progresse into the north parts, and were honorablie receiued
in the principall cities and townes where they came, and likewise by the nobles of the
countrie, to the great reioising of the whole realme. After their returning to Edenburgh,
the king called a parlement in the moneth of Maie 1471, in the which among other things
<note place="marg"><date>1471.</date></note>
it was ordeined, that the lords, barons, and burroughs of the realme, should build ships and

by the king vnto the abbasie of Pasley, and then in such wise began promotings of secular
priests to abbasies at the princes request, and the laudable elections ancientlie vsed, made
void: bicause the court of Rome admitted such as the princes made sute for and named,
getting great rewards and notable summes of monie thereby, so that neither the bishops
durst admit such as the couents elected, nor such as were elected durst pursue their right,
and so the abbasies were bestowed vpon such as followed the court, and liued courtlie,
secularlie, and voluptuouslie, to the great slander of religious men, which by the naughtie
examples of their gouernors fell to the works of wickednesse, wherevpon dailie much euill
increased, and vertue in all estates decaied.</p>
<p>This y&eacute;ere in September, the indulgence of the s&eacute;e of saint Andrews was published by

archbishop of Yorke was metropolitan of Scotland, and that there was oftentimes warre
betwixt the realmes of England and Scotland, the Scotishmen could not haue accesse to
their metropolitan, speciallie in cases of appellation. And therefore the pope (as some write)
thought it reason to make saint Andrews primat and metropolitan of Scotland, and ordeined

that the twelue other bishops of Scotland should be vnder his primasie, who would not

This y&eacute;ere was a great death in the realme of Scotland, so that where a parlement was called

duke of Albanie, Andrew Steward lord of Auendale, chancellor, and others, till the said
duke, the archbishop of saint Andrewes, the chancellor, the earle of Argile, and diuerse
others, went to Striueling to visit the qu&eacute;ene and prince, where the duke was persuaded by
the qu&eacute;ene, without knowledge thereof giuen to the other, to go vnto Edenburgh, and to restore the king vnto libertie. The duke accordinglie to the qu&eacute;enes pleasure comming to
<note place="marg">The king is set at libertie.</note>
Edenburgh, besieged the castell and wan it, remooued the earle of Atholl, and set the king
and all his seruants at libertie, for the which good turne, the king shewed great tokens of
loue to his brother the duke, although it lasted not long. The earle of Argile, the bishop of
saint Andrewes, the chancellor, and others, which remained at Striueling, when they heard
those newes, fled into their owne countries: and shortlie after, the bishop of S. Andrewes, at
request of the king, resigned his bishoprike in fauor of maister Andrew Steward prouost of
<note place="marg">The archbishop resigneth.</note>
Glenelowden, and was content in recompense thereof, with the bishoprike of Murrey. This
y&eacute;ere there was great theft, reiffe, and slaughter in diuerse parts of the realme, by occasion of
<note place="marg"><date>1483.</date></note>
the variance betwixt the king and his nobles.</p>
<p>* Charles the eight, king of France (in the beginning of his kingdome) sent into Scotland
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 8. <emph>pag.</emph> 323.</note>
certeine ambassadors, which were Beroald or Bernard Steward, lord of Aubignie, marshall
of France, and Peter Mallart doctor of both lawes, to renew the old league betw&eacute;ene this
Iames the third, and the king of France: for which cause the king of Scots and the nobles
assembled at Edenburgh, where (with the French ambassadors) s&eacute;eking all the rols of all
the ancient leagues, they reconfirmed the same, with the seales of both parts set therevnto;
<note place="marg"><date>1483.</date></note>
which doone, the Frenchmen (with whome were sent into France diuerse Scots) returned
home. Amongest the Scots, one Robertson was the chiefe, a man famous for the feates of
battell, and hauing imploied his seruice on the parts of the French in the Italian warres,
which being ended, the said chosen soldiors following the conduct of Beroald Steward, went
into England with Henrie earle of Richmont, after king, whose part they tooke against Richard at that time vsurper vpon the English, for which cause the earle of Richmont (when
he was after king) did deerelie loue the Scots.</p>
<p>The seditions also, which a long time did burne in France, caused deadlie wars to grow
betw&eacute;ene the king of France and the duke of Burgognie. Wherevnto, when the death of
Charles (the last duke of Burgognie, slaine at Nants by the duke of Loraine) did set end:
Charles the eight of that name, king of France (assembling a great armie) did applie all his
force and deuise to expell Alphonse out of the kingdome of Naples, who at that time succ&eacute;eded happilie vnto him, by reason that Alphonse was then easilie remooued. But after,
when the Neapolitane people did reuolt (from the French faction) to Ferdinand the son of
Alphonse, there arose great flames of warre and sedition through Italie, ech part studieng
to support the strength of his owne. The administration of which warre against Ferdinand, was chieflie performed by the Scots, as principall capteins of that armie, or at the least
equall with the best. Of which Scots the chiefe were Alexander duke of Albanie, son to
Iames the second king of Scots, Iohn also duke of Albanie sonne of this Alexander, George
Montgomerie lord of Lorges, Bernard Steward (who was after made viceroy of Naples, which
office he wiselie manie y&eacute;eres did execute) Robert Steward marshall of France, Nicholas
Scot, and others, wherof manie (for their woorthie exploits) were by the French honorablie
rewarded with great possessions. Who also (as manie of the Scots before had doone)
planting themselues in Isubria, became the authors of manie ancient families. For though

countrie) yet by the ensignes, and tokens which they had and vsed, it may easilie be knowne
of what families the Scots their ancestors did descend.</p>
<p>Wherefore it followeth by most certeine coniecture, that the ancient familie of the earles

witnesse: which kindred (besides manie other earles thereof) is at this day notablie beautified
by Christopher Scot, who (with singular pietie and learning) dooth gouerne the church of
Caualion. Againe, there is another familie of Scots, commonlie called the Scoties in Isubria, whereof Bernard Scotia and Horace his brother (the one a senator of Mantua, and the
other a prelat) are both famous, as well for their vertue, as nobilitie: also Francis Scotia,
lord of Pine and Mondone, and other nobles of the marquesdome of Saluce, are descended
from the Scots, with the large familie of the Schities (descended of lames Orlando Scot,
which we haue heard confirmed by the armes of that familie) are well aduanced about Cremona, Mantua, and Verona, as are also the Paparons in Rome (so called for their armes
and ensignes) whose ancestors to be of the Scotish nobilitie, is witnessed by a woorthie monument thereof in the church of saint Marie the great, in which the father and the son called
Paparons, being there buried, are both adorned with the ensignes of knighthood out of

<note place="marg">Lords are summoned.</note>
left the king, and assisted the duke of Albanie. And the king through counsell of certeine

and afterwards being accompanied with the earle of Dowglasse, and a great number of
Englishmen, inuaded Scotland vpon the west marches, where manie Englishmen were slaine

and taken by the resistance of the lords Cokpull, Iohnston, and others, the duke was put to

therevpon taking a misliking, secretlie departed ouer into France by the helpe of Iohn Liddell, sonne to sir Iames Liddell knight, who afterwards lost his life for the same. The duke
was well interteined in France by the king there: and finallie running at tilt with Lewes
duke of Orleance, was hurt with the splint of a speare, and thereof died. He left behind him
two sonnes, Iohn duke of Albanie, that was after gouernor and tutor to king lames the fift,
and Alexander that was after bishop of Murrey, and abbat of Scone. This y&eacute;ere the lord
Hume, Torreklis, Oliphant, and Drummond, were made lords of the parlement. In the

<note place="marg">The castell of Dunbar in the Englishmens hands.</note>
was deliuered vnto the Englishmen by the duke of Albanie, when he fled into France, and

<note place="marg">The battell ground.</note>
accorded, that the same should remaine without sowing, earing, building, or inhabiting, as it

mariage to be had betwixt the prince of Rothsaie, eldest sonne to king lames &amp; ladie Anne
de la Poole, daughter to lohn duke of Suffolke and to the ladie Anne his wife, that was sister

the mariage was agr&eacute;ed vpon, and writings thereof drawen, ingrossed, and sealed, and affiances made and taken by proctors and deputies on both parts. The foresaid yoong ladie was
immediatlie called princesse of Rothsaie, but by the short life of king Richard hir vncle she
shortlie after lost that name.</p>

the expressing and declaring of his opinion touching the castell of Dunbar, whether he would
be agreeable that the same should remaine onelie six moneths, or else during the tearme of
the whole truce in the Englishmens possessions, he wrote vnto king Richard a louing letter,
<note place="marg">King Iames by letters singnifieth his mind touching the articles of Dunbar.</note>
signifieng vnto him, that he was not minded to s&eacute;eke the recouerie of the said castell by force

treatie and aliance was sproong vp betwixt them, that he would redeliuer the said casteli
into his hands, according as reason might moue him thereto; considering the Englishmen
had no right to it, being onelie deliuered to them by traitors of their natiue countrie, without anie reasonable cause, or commission lawfullie authorised.</p>

crowne of that realme. And after he was somewhat quietlie established in the same, he
came into the north parts, where he remained the most part of the next summer, and regarding northing more than to haue the loue and friendship of his neighbors, &amp; to be confederat with the kings and princes ioining next vnto him, he sent from Newcastell one of his

vnto king Iames, to treat a contract, and renew the bond of peace and truce betwixt the said
kings and their realmes.</p>
<p>These ambassadors were gladlie receiued of king lames, who declared vnto them, that he
<note place="marg">The kings answer.</note>
bare great fauor and loue vnto their maister, and would be glad to pleasure him in all he
might: howbeit, that his subiects were not of so good a mind towards the English nation
as he himselfe wished, and therefore he willed them to be contented with a truce for seuen yeares, sith further he could not doo, for doubt to offend his nobilitie and subiects.
But he promised secretlie, that when those seuen yeares were expired, he would renew the
<note place="marg">His promise.</note>
same for the tearme of other seuen yeares, and so from seuen yeares to seuen yeares so long
as he liued. This he did, because he perceiued that his people had him in such hatred,
that they would not consent to anie bond that he should make. The ambassadors perceiuing his good meaning toward king Henrie, confirmed the truce for those seuen yeares,
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 12.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1487.</date></note>
and so returned home to king Henrie, who was glad of that they had doone.</p>
<p>* In the meane time died the qu&eacute;ene, a woman of singular beautie and goodnesse, who
was supposed greatlie to mitigat the vnbridled force of hir husband. At what time also
in France died Alexander the kings brother, leauing behind him two sonnes, which were
Alexander borne of his first wife (daughter to the earle of Orkeneie) and Iohn (borne of his
second wife) being after made gouernor of Scotland.) Immediatlie after that this truce was
thus concluded betwixt the two realmes, king Iames caused the thr&eacute;e estates to assemble in
<note place="marg">A parlement.</note>
parlement at Edenburgh the first of October in the yeare 1487, in the which order was
<note place="marg">No pardon to be granted to offendors for the space of seuen yeares.</note>
taken, that iustice oires should be holden through all the parts of the realme, &amp; that no
pardons should be granted for anie great crime that shuld be committed for the space of
seuen yeares to come, so that the king began to vse sharpe execution of iustice in all parts,
which was right displeasant to manie.</p>
<p>At the same time was an ambassador sent to the king of Romans, for the calling in of a

letter of marque, which had b&eacute;ene granted against Scotish merchants, at the sute and instance
of certeine Hollanders and Burgognions, and was shortlie after herevpon reuoked. After
the parlement was ended, the king remooued vnto Striueling, leauing his wife the qu&eacute;ene.
and hir sonne the prince at Edenburgh castell, whilest he k&eacute;eping persons about him of
meane calling, gaue himselfe to take his pleasure with women, &amp; to gather vp gold and siluer, greatlie to the offense of his subiects. Yet in the meane time, now after the death of
king Richard, whether it was by treson or appointment, the castell of Dunbar was deliuered
to the hands of king lames, and that to his great ioy and high contentation; for he that
ruled his kingdome more with rigor than with anie tractable meane of fauorable iustice, stood
euer in feare of some troublesome tumult that might be raised by his owne people, if occasion were ministred either through hope of forren aid or otherwise.</p>
<p>So long therefore as the castell was in the Englishmens hands, he doubted least through
practise, some conspiracie should be contriued betwixt his owne subiects and the English nation, greatlie to the annoiance of his estate, &amp; therevpon he was the more desirous to reduce
the same castell into his possession. But the onelie meane to haue assured himselfe from
<note place="marg">The meane whereby king Iames might haue auoided danger of deth by his subiects.</note>
the hands of such as sought his life, had beene to haue changed his wilfull maner of gouernment, &amp; to haue leaned vnto such counsell as would haue aduised him for the wealth
of his whole realme, and not vpon desire to please, haue mainteined his vndiscr&eacute;et opinions,
to the wronging aswell of his commons as of the nobles and peeres of his realme; for the
nobilitie of Scotland, namelie the earles of Angus, Argile, and Lenox, the lords Halis, Hume,
Drummond, Greie, and others, perceiuing themselues oppressed by such as from base birth
<note place="marg">The conspiracie of the Scotish lords against king Iames the third.</note>
had risen (without woorthie deseruing) to the degr&eacute;e of counsellors, and therewith aduanced
to so high authoritie, as all things were ordered at their appointment, conspired togither, &amp;
determined by force of armes to s&eacute;e a reformation in such a disordered maner of gouernement.</p>
<p>But yet because it should not be thought that they minded the destruction of their countrie, but rather the aduancement thereof, they made the lord lames duke of Rothsaie sonne
to the king (a child borne to goodnesse and vertue) the chiefe capteine in this their

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"459"</fw>-->

enterprise, and that in maner against his will; hereby openlie protesting, that they minded and
purposed the suppressing and confusion of an euill king, and not the subuersion of their
natiue countrie. By which their craftie imagined inuention, they thought to remooue all
suspicion of their purposed vntruth and shamefull disloialtie. They had sent to the earle
of Dowglasse, who remained prisoner (as ye haue heard) in the abbeie of Lundoris, and
required him to assist them in their begun enterprise, promising that they would restore
him againe to his lands and former dignitie, and honor him as principall of their faction.
But that noble, wise, and ancient earle, being alreadie schooled with troubles, and hauing
learned by experience (to his great griefe) what such matter meant, refused to breake his
ward, or to assist them in anie wise, dissuading them from their enterprise, because it s&eacute;emed
to him neither godlie nor honorable, sithens both himselfe and his friends had tasted for
the like, great hinderance, which might be an example to him and others to beware in time
to come.</p>
<p>The king being once informed of this rebellion and conspiracie against him, was sore
<note place="marg">King Iames gathereth an armie.</note>
disquieted in his mind, and to meet their mischiefous attempts, gathered an armie. Yet
before the vsing of anie force, he sent messengers to his sonne, and to the nobles with him,
to trie if he might come to some agr&eacute;ement with them. He sent also letters to the king of
<note place="marg">He sendeth letters to the kings of England &amp; France.</note>

<note place="marg">Eugenius 8.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan.</emph></note>
England, &amp; to the French king, requiring them to take some paines in the matter, to procure an attonement betwixt him and his nobles. And besides this, he wrote to pope Innecent about the same purpose, praieng him to intermeddle his authoritie by sending some
legate into Scotland, to appease the troubles thereof. But the Scotish nobilitie, and such of the
people as were vp in armor against him, were so desperatlie set, and wholie bent on reuenge,
that no wholesome counsell nor medicinable aduise might appease their furious rage, so that
for answer to his messengers, they sent him word, that if hee would resigne the title of his
<note place="marg">The answer of the rebels to the kings message.</note>
crowne and realme, &amp; depose himselfe of his whole regall dignitie, then they would come
to some communication with him or else not. The like answer was giuen to the ambassadors
of England and France, that were sent vnto them from the kings of both those realmes,
which sore lamented the fortune of their friend and alie the Scotish king.</p>
<p>But Adrian the bishop of Romes legat came too late, as who should say, a day after the
faire: for when their grounded malice and spitefull hatred conceiued against him might not
be qualified by anie maner of means, but that they were now comming forward with all their
puisance to Striueling, where he then remained, he would not staie till the erles of Huntleie,
Erroll, Atholl, Crawford, Rothus, Sutherland, Cathnesse, &amp; Marshall; the barons, Forbes,
Ogiluie, Granth, Fraiser, and others, were arriued with their powers, amounting to the number of fortie thousand men, with the which they were comming foorth of the north parts to
his aid: but rashlie and without good aduise he issued out of the towne, accompanied with
the earles of Glencarne &amp; Montros, the lords Graham, Ruthuen, Maxwell, and certeine
others, and forthwith ioined battell with his aduersaries at Banockesborne, within two miles
of Striueling.</p>
<p>Now when nothing might quiet them, at length they met thus in a pitched field, where
<note place="marg">They m&eacute;et in a pitched field.</note>

<note place="marg">The king is put to the woorsse.</note>

<note place="marg">He is slaine.</note>
after great slaughter &amp; murther made of an huge multitude of people, the king being put
to the woorsse, fled into a mill, whither being fiercelie followed and found therin, he was
cruellie slaine, and vnreuerentlie left starke naked. &para; A notable mirror to all princes, that
calling to remembrance such a miserable and most dolorous sight, they may take h&eacute;ed by
what maner of persons they suffer themselues to be led and abused. For if this prince king
Iames the third had not followed vpon a wilfull pretense, and obstinat mind, the counsell
and aduise of vantperlors, and such as (being aduanced from base degr&eacute;e vnto high authoritie) studied more to keepe themselues in fauor, than to giue true aduertisements, and
faithfull aduise vnto their prince, he might haue reigned longer by manie daies &amp; y&eacute;eres, in
great and high felicitie. [In which conflict was on the kings part slaine (as saith Buchanan)
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
Alexander Coningham, earle of Glencarne.] He was thus slaine neere Striueling, on the
seuenth day of Iune, the y&eacute;ere after the incarnation 1488, being also the 29 of his reigne.</p>

<p>Now then, after that the barons of Scotland had thus slaine their souereigne lord and

of Scotland, and began his reigne the 24 of Iune y&eacute;ere 1488, being not past sixteene

yeeres of age, who notwithstanding that he had b&eacute;ene in the field with the nobles of the
reaime against his father, that contrarie to his mindwas slaine; yet neuerthelesse afterwards,
h&eacute;e became a right noble prince, &amp; seemed to take great repentance for that his offense,
<note place="marg">The king was repentant.</note>

<note place="marg">The king wore an iron chaine.</note>

<note place="marg">Was giuen to deuotion.</note>

<note place="marg">He was a great iusticer.</note>
and in token thereof, he ware continuallie an iron chaine about his midle all the daies of his
life. He was greatlie giuen to deuotion and praier, visiting religious houses, and bestowing
on them sundrie fifts. He gouerned his realme in great rest, peace, iustice, and quietnesse,
riding him selfe in proper person diuerse daies and nights, to suppresse and take th&eacute;eues,
robbers, and oppressors of his subiects in all parts of his realme, till he had brought the
countrie to great quietnesse. He was learned and liberall, and indued with manie other
<note place="marg">He was learned.</note>
good vertues and qualities.</p>
<p>Anon after his coronation, the earle of Lennox, and the lord Lile, with diuers other their
assistants, notwithstanding that they had beene with him at the slaughter of his father, s&eacute;eing
that things went not as they wished, raised an armie, and caused the dead kings bloudie

the yoong king, were ouerthrowne at Tolimosse, where the Lennox men, and sundrie other
of the barons side were slaine, as the lord of Kiltrucht, and other taken and hanged for
their offenses. The king called a parlement atEdenburgh, which was holden the sixt of
<note place="marg">A parlement.</note>
October, where he being mooued by clemencie, granted a generall pardon to all those that
<note place="marg">A generall pardon.</note>
came in field at Striueling with his father against him, and appointed euerie one to haue
speciall pardons therevpon vnder his seales. He likewise dispensed with the heires of them
that were slaine with his father there in field, appointing them their particular dispensations
vnder his seales, after the same maner. Further it was ordeined, that all iustices, shiriffes,
stewards, bailiffes, lieutenants, and other which had offices in heritage, and had b&eacute;ene with
his father at the field, should be suspended from the same offices for the tearme of three
yeeres: and those which had offices for life, or for terme of y&eacute;eres, should be vtterlie excluded from the same.</p>
<p>Moreouer, he tooke order that all such goods as had b&eacute;ene taken from landed men and
burgesses, should be restored to them againe, except that which was taken from such landed
men and burgesses as were in the field against him; for that was deemed a lawfull preie.
It was also iudged that the death of his father came vpon him through his owne default,
and that king Iames the fourth then reigning, and all his adherents and partakers in that
field, were innocent and giltlesse of all slaughter made there at that time, and clearlie acquit of all pursute and occasion thereof : the thr&eacute;e estates granting to giue their seales to
testifie the same, with the kings great seale of the realme, to be shewed vnto the pope, the
kings of France, Spaine, Denmarke, and other princes their confederats. And for the
ceassing of theft, reiffe, &amp; such other great enormities, the king was appointed to ride in
person once euerie yeere through all parts of the realme. And certeine noble men were
ordeined to exercise iustice in euerie shire next adioining to the places where they had their
chiefe residence: and herevnto they gaue their othes to be diligent in the administration of
iustice. These ordinances were right well obserued all the daies of K. Iames the fourth his
life time, so that the realme was reduced to great tranquillitie, and gouerned in good peace
and iustice. Furthermore, all gifts made by his father in preiudice of the crowne, were
reuoked, from the second day of Februarie immediatlie preceading his death, to the day in
which h&eacute;e was slaine.</p>
<p>* About this time was a monster borne of a strange forme, hauing from the nauill 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 18.</note>
downeward the perfect parts of one man, not different from the right proportion of man: but

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"461"</fw>-->

from the nauill vpward, it was double bodied, hauing all perfect parts answering euerie
of those bodies, sundered to all actions and shew. This monster the king commande to
be diligentlie nourished and instructed, but chieflie in musike (wherein it profited velie
much.) Further also learning diners sorts of languages, whose seuerall wits and natures
manifestlie appeared by diuers dispositions of their minds. For sometime they would fall
out one with another, and when anie thing displeased them, they would most bitterly contend the one with the other: contrarilie, when anie thing happened to their liking or desire,
they would consult and agr&eacute;e togither as friends. In which this was woorthie remembrance, that if the legges or loines had b&eacute;ene hurt below, they both togither felt the paine;
but if they were pinched or grieued in any part aboue seuered from the other, then that
bodie onetie felt the same which had that hurt doone vnto it. Which different sense did
more plainelie appeare in the death of the one of them: for when the one bodie died manie
daies before the other, that which liued, did after by little and little consume, by the putrifaction of the other bodie then dead which monster liued 28 y&eacute;eress, and in the time of
Iohn the gouernor: of which thing we doubt not to write (more boldlie) sith there are
men yet lining of honest fame which saw these things.)</p>
<p>This king in the beginning of his reigne, to make, his estate the surer, and more faithfull
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. li.</emph> 18.</note>
to reconcile the harts of such as had mainteined factions against him, determined to marie
the daughters of his aunt by two husbands, to two of those noble men: for which cause he
maried Grecina Boid to Alexander Forbois, and Margaret Hammilton to Matthew Steward,
by which in time there followed a most singular peace in the kingdome.) Also an esquier,
<note place="marg"><date>1486.</date></note>

<note place="marg">A mariage sought for the king.</note>
and an herald were sent into France, Spaine, and other places, to learne where the king
might be a suter for some great ladie to ioine with him in mariage. Moreouer beside these
there were sent honorable ambassadors into France, Spaine, and Denmarke, to renew the old
amities &amp; leagues betwixt those realmes and Scotland, as had b&eacute;ene vsed in the dales of this
kings progenitors. His two brethren, the duke of Rothseie, and the earle of Mar, he caused
to be brought vp in good nourture and vertuous exercise, appointing to them such liuings
for maintenance of their estates, as his father had assigned them.</p>
<p>For his councell he chose a cerreine number of the prelats, nobie men, and barons of his
realme, such as were thought most meet, taking this order, that six of them at the least
should continuallie remaine about him, by whose aduise he should doo all things that
touched the affaires of the realme: and in case any thing was done without their aduise, the
same should be iudged void, &amp; not to be obeied, &amp; this was inuiolablie kept all his dales.
When the esquier and herald were returned againe into Scotland, which had bene to visit
<note place="marg"><date>1491.</date></note>
strange countries, and made report of that they had s&eacute;ene, there was a parlement holden,
in which it was ordeined, that the bishop of Giascow, the earle Bothwell, and others,
should go as ambassadors to sue for the kings mariage in place where it should be most
expedient, and most to the kings liking. Great variance rose betwixt the archbishop of
<note place="marg">Two archbishops striue for the preheminence.</note>
saint Andrews, and the bishop of Glascow, touching the preheminence of their iurisdiction
which drew the noble men into factions, till the king commanded the same to ceasse, and
that they should trie it by law before competent iudges.</p>
<p>* Iames Ogiluie knight of Aire, was sent ambassador to the king of Denmarke, to whome

Danes and the Scots, which he wiselie executed and obteined, with certeine priuileges for
the benefit of the merchants. By means whereof at his returne, he purchased such fauour
of the king, as that he was aduanced to the title of a lord, in which the name of the Ogiluies
was first increased with anie honorable title.) The king about the same time tooke order

passe vpon inquests, he ordeined that euerie landed man should put his eldest sonne to
schoole, that he might learne perfectlie the lawes of the realme, and that vpon great for
feiture. Thus in the beginning of his reigne, diuers good lawes and constitutions were made,
for the aduancement of the common-wealth, which he caused to be dulie obserued and kept
<note place="marg">1494. <emph>Lesle.</emph></note>
during his time. The pope sent a protonotarie called Forman into Scotland, with a rose
<note place="marg">A protonotarie sent into Scotland with a rose.</note>

<note place="marg">1495. <emph>Lesle.</emph></note>
and a scepter of gold, to be presented vnto the king, desiring him to perseuere in godlinesse, honor, and vertue, as he had begun. The most part of this y&eacute;ere the king spent in
riding abroad through all parts of his realme to s&eacute;e iustice ministred, speciallie in the north
parts, where the people are commonlie furthest out of order.</p>
<note place="marg"><date>1492.</date></note>
<p>There was shortlie after some appearance of warres betwixt England and France, 
<note place="marg">The king goeth on progresse.</note>
wherevpon king Charles sent vnto king Iames, requiring him of assistance, if it came to passe that

Richard duke of Yorke, second sonne to king Edward the fourth, who had b&eacute;ene preserued
now manie y&eacute;eres secretlie by his aunt Margaret duches of Burgognie, and therefore was
iust inheritor to the realme of England, whom he would send into Scotland, praieng the king
to assist him to recouer his rightfull heritage, the said realme of England. And shortlie after
herevpon, the said feined duke (whose right name was Perkin Warbecke, as in the English
<note place="marg">Perkin Warbecke.</note>
historie it appeareth) arriued in Scotland well and honorablie accompanied, to trie what
purchase he might make there for succors to atteine his pretended right to the crowne of
England.</p>
<p>* After whose arriuall he was brought to the presence of king Iames, before whom he
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 13.</note>
did larnentablie bewaile (as he well could) the fall of the house of Yorke, and his owne
calamities: most humblie and vehementlie bes&eacute;eching him, to ransome the kinglie bloud
from that contumelie. For answer wherevnto at that present time, the king bid him be of
good heart, for he would so woorke, that he should find his sute not defrauded of all due
effect, in obteining succor in his distresse. Few daies after, the king assembling togither
his councell, commanded this (counterfeit) duke of Yorke to be brought vnto him, who
now (more than before) did in this assemblie bitterlie complaine of his misfortune, shewing,
that being borne to great hope of a kingdome (as the sonne of the noblest king of that age)
he was left void of all helpe by the death of his father, &amp; had like to haue fallen into the
tyrannie of his vncle Richard duke of Glocester, before he could vnderstand what calamitie
or misfortune might signifie.</p>
<p>But aided by diuine assistance, he (when his elder brother was murthered by his vncle)
was preserued by the helpe of his fathers friends, and conueied away from the bloudie
hands of the vsurping king Richard, who (not able in that kingdome, whose heire by right
he was) to lead a bare and begged life, did so liue in forrein countries, as he counted the
condition of his brother (taken from those miseries by sudden death) to be happie in respect of his owne troubles and extremitie: for he was reserued aliue to the scorne of fortune,
not daring at the first to bewaile his calamitie amongst strangers, whereby he might mooue
their pitie towards him: yea (and after) when by little and little he came to open what
person h&eacute;e was, how noblie borne, whose heire, and to whome alied, he was (to increase
all his former miseries) more grieuouslie assaulted by the malice of fortune than before. For
then he could not almost liue in safetie in anie place, bicause of the subultie of his enimies,
who would haue bought his life (of those with whom he remained) priuilie solliciting
them to discouer his secrets, and (vnder the colour of feined amitie) to corrupt his true
friends, to search out and discouer his hidden friends, and to defame him amongst the common people.</p>
<p>Wherewithall not yet satisfied, they reuile (said he) the ladie Margaret his aunt, and
imprison the nobles of England that s&eacute;emed to fauor his cause; notwithstanding all which
(she vsing the truth of hir owne conscience against the slanders of hir and his enimies, and
mooued with pitie for the distresse of hir kinsman) did with hir abilitie relieue his necessitie.

But at length, when he saw no sure defense in a woman and widow (whose authoritie
could not stretch to the command of hir people in that liberall sort as she would) he was
driuen to s&eacute;eke the aid of other princes, and to request them to looke into the misfortunes
that might light vpon such great estates, and that they would not suffer kinglie bloud (oppressed by tyrants) to lament in such extremitie. For yet he was not so base minded
(although hee were in manie great miseries) that he would not hope at one time or other
to be restored to his kingdome, by the helpe of such friends as he had in Ireland and England: adding therevnto the helpe which he should haue out of France, whereof he had
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 1. <emph>pag.</emph> 334.</note>
alreadie made some triall by the singular beneuolence of the same king, hauing liberallie imparted manie benefits vnto him.</p>
<p>Besides which, not supposing this to allure the kings mind to his fauor, he began by
flattrie to extoll him, not douting but he (whose fauor had bene liberallie shewd to the
destressed) wold now diminish the same to him; but that he hoped that he would (for his
singular humanitie to all banished persons, for pitie towards a miserable creature, for loue
towards his kinsman, for necessities cause towards his friend, and for the n&eacute;erenesse of
league that ought to be among princes) succor and relieue him with men and monie, thereby
to helpe him to the recouerie of his kingdom. Wherfore againe he importunatly requireth
the king of aid in this extremitie, since the same was honorable to himselfe, acceptable to
God, beneficiall for his realme, and a singular fame among other princes in ioining with
them determined to restore him. Which if he might obteine (and that the rather by his
furtherance) he did liberallie promise alwaies to stand a most firme friend to the Scots, for
whose cause he would spend his crowne and life.)</p>
<p>Thus Perkin Warbecke did vse the matter in such subtill wise, that king Iames either
giuing, or s&eacute;eming to giue credit to his words, after aduise and deliberation had and taken
with his councell, receiued him in honorable wise, naming and reputing him duke of Yorke,
and therefore promised him to aid him in all that he might. And shortlie after, h&eacute;e maried

further, but that he could perceiue no aid comming in vnto this new found duke, contrarie
to such golden promises as he had made, that as soone as they were entered into England,
there would flocke vnto him both of the nobilitie and commons, and that in great numbers.</p>
<p>King Iames perceiuing no such matter, thought it better to returne with assured gaine,

than to tarie this new sproong dukes doubtfull and vncerteine victorie. And so hauing his

to send the same against the Scots: but the rebellion of the Cornishmen, which chanced
the same time about a taxe leuied then of the people, constreined him to imploie that armie

and was comming towards them, they returned to the host lieng before Norham, where
king Iames perceiuing he could not win the castell, notwithstanding he had doone great hurt
and damage thereto, he raised his siege, retired into his countrie, and left great companies

certeine commissioners of both the realmes should m&eacute;et at Melrosse, where for the king
of England, doctor Fox, then bishop of Durham, with this Hialas, and other graue personages, met the Scotish commissioners. After long conference and much talke had, for the

matters, quarreis, demands, and causes, whatsoeuer the same had bene, that a perpetuali
peace might haue b&eacute;ene concluded, because he was chieflie sent for that intent.</p>
<p>The king of England required to haue the counterfeit duke of Yorke (otherwise named
Perkin Warbecke) deliuered to him: but king Iames (est&eacute;eming his honor more than anie
<note place="marg">An article for Perkin Warbecke.</note>
earthlie thing) would in no wise s&eacute;eme to betraie him that fled to him for succour, and
with whome he had coopled one of his owne kinswomen in mariage: but he was contented
to couenant, that the same Perkin should be constreined to depart out of Scotland, and not
to be further aided by him, or by anie other through his meanes or procurement. The
king of Scots to k&eacute;epe promise made in the said treatie of peace, and knowing himselfe to
be abused by the said Richard, whom he had reputed to be verelie duke of Yorke (although
<note place="marg">King Iames reasoneth with the counterfeit duke of Yorke.</note>
he was not so) called him before his presence, and declared to him the great fauour and
good will which he had borne towards him, putting him in remembrance that for his sake
he had taken warre in hand against England, and inuaded the countrie in hope of assistance
by his friends within the land, where not one resorted to him.</p>
<p>And albeit he had maried his n&eacute;ere kinswoman, yet might he not k&eacute;epe longer warre
with England for his sake onelie; except he might be sure of some aid through his meanes,
whereof he could s&eacute;e no app&eacute;erance. He desired him therefore to withdraw foorth of his
realme, either into Flanders to his fathers sister the ladie Margaret; or into some other place
where it pleased him to abide, and expect some better time more conueniet for his purpose. The said Richard gaue the king thanks, and obeied his pleasure, departing shortlie
after out of Scotland, and sailed into Ireland, from thence to transport into Flanders. But
<note place="marg">Perkin Warbeck went into Ireland to come into Flanders.</note>
finallie making an attempt into England, he was taken prisoner in the abbeie of Beaulien,
togither with his wife, whose beautie was such, as king Henrie thought hir a more m&eacute;et
preie for an emperor, than for souldiors, and therefore vsed hir verie honorablie, appointing
hir to remaine in the court with the qu&eacute;ene his wife, where she continued so long as the

the castell, as it had beene to haue viewed it. But although they meat no euill, yet diuerse,
of the Scotishmen were slaine, and manie wounded and sore hurt; so that king lames
hauing information thereof, was sore displeased therewith, thinking and saieng, that there
was no more vncerteine thing, than to haue peace with England. And herevpon he sent
his herald Merchmount with sharpe and vehement letters vnto the king of England, making
great complaint for this iniurie and wrong doone to his subiects, by those within the castell
of Norham. But receiuing most reasonable letters for excuse of that which was doone, as
well from the king of England himselfe, as from the bishop of Durham owner of the castell,
<note place="marg">King Iames requireth to talke with the bishop of Durham.</note>
he was indifferentlie well appeased &amp; satisfied, so that he required to haue the bishop to

seuenth, as then king of England, to be giuen him in mariage: and further declared that
he was minded to send his orators vnto hir father the said king Henrie, about the same
malter. And forsomuch as he knew that the bishop was one that might doo much with
king Henrie, who highlie fauoured him for his singular wisedome and learning, he desired
him to be a meane to further his sute, which if it were obteined, he trusted it should highlie
redound to the honor &amp; wealth of both the realmes. The bishop considering h&eacute;erein as
much as the king was able to tell him, did not onelie promise to doo all that in him lay,
but also incouraged him to send his orators with all sp&eacute;ed, trusting that they should receiue
a verie towardlie answer.</p>

certeine persons ambassadors vnto king Henrie, to mooue him to the effect aboue mentioned.
These ambassadors were highlie welcomed, and verie well heard, so that to be briefe, their
request s&eacute;emed so agr&eacute;eable to king Henries mind, that the mariage was shortlie therevpon
concluded (but not consummate betwixt the foresaid Iames king of Scotland, and the said
ladie Margaret daughter to king Henrie) in the seuent&eacute;enth y&eacute;ere of the said king Henries
reigne. At the same time, when this mariage was so agr&eacute;ed vpon, a peace was also concluded betwixt the kings of England and Scotland, for the terme of their two liues. And
to auoid that none of either of the said kings subiects that had offended the lawes, should
be receiued into anie of their dominions; it was accorded, that no Englishman should
come within Scotland, without his princes letters supplicatorie vnto the king of Scots, nor
anie Scotishman to come within England, without the like letters from his prince, desiring
safe conduct and passeport.</p>
<p>In the yeere next insuing, Robert Blakater the bishop of Glascow, Adam Hepborne the
<note place="marg"><date>1501.</date></note>
earle Bothwell, and other noble men of Scotland, were sent in ambassage from king lames
vnto the king of England, for the perfecting of the foresaid mariage betwixt king lames,
and the ladie Margaret, eldest daughter to king Henrie, which earle by letters of procuracie
and mandat, in the name of his maister king lames, affied and handfasted the foresaid
ladie Margaret in all solemne wise, according to the maner: which assurance and contract
<note place="marg">This was in the y&eacute;ere 1502.</note>
thus made, was published at Paules crosse in London, on the day of the conuersion of saint
Paule, in reioising whereof <emph>Te Deum</emph> was soong, and fiers made, with great feasring &amp;
banketting throughout that citie. This doone, the ambassadors returned into Scotland, and
then afterwards was great preparation made in England for the conueieng of the said ladie
into Scotland, and likewise great purueiance there for the receiuing of hir.</p>
<p>On the sixt&eacute;enth of Iune, king Henrie tooke his iournie from Richmond, with his daughter

the said ladie Margaret, and came to Coliweston, where his mother the countesse of Richmond then laie. And after he had remained there certeine daies in pastime and great solace,
he tooke leaue of his daughter, giuing hir his blessing with a fatherlie exhortation, and committed the conueiance of hir into Scotland vnto the earle of Surreie, and others. The earle
of Northumberland, as then warden of the marches, was appointed to deliuer hir vpon the
borders vnto the king of Scotland. And so this faire ladie was conueied with a great companie of lords, ladies, knights, esquires, and gentlemen, vntill she came to the towne of
Berwike, and from thence vnto Lambert church in Lamer moore within Scotland, where
she was receiued by the king and all the nobles of that realme, and from the said place of
Lamberton church, she was conueied vnto Edenburgh, where the day after hir comming

interteinment. For aswell the noble men as the ladies and gentlewomen of Scotland at that
present, were nothing behind the English lords &amp; ladies in costlie apparell, massie chaines,
and other furniture, as well for themselues as their horsses, and made great bankets to the
Englishmen, and shewed them such iusts and other pleasant pastimes in honor of the mariage,
so well, as after the maner of the countrie could be deuised. By reason of this mariage and
aliance, men were in great good hope that perfect peace and sincere amitie should continue
betwixt the two realmes of England and Scotland a long time after: and verelie during the
life of king Henrie the seuenth, no cause of breach was ministred betwixt him and his sonne
in law, but that they liued in great loue and amitie.</p>
<p>About this time, the king of Denmarke, through diuision that did rise betwixt him &amp; his
<note place="marg">The king of Denmarke commeth into Scotland.</note>
lords, was constreined to forsake his countrie, and to come for aid into Scotland, where the
king receiued him louinglie, and vpon his earnest sute, for that he was both his coosine and
confederat, and also the rather, at the contemplation of the French kings request and persuasion, he prepared an armie of ten thousand men, the which vnder the conduct of the
earle of Arrane, he sent with the said king of Denmarke to assist him against his aduersaries.
The earle of Arrane according to his commission, attending the Danish king into his countrie,
<note place="marg">He is restored to his kingdome by the earle of Arrane lieutenant to king Iames.</note>
restored him to his kingdome and former gouernement, and so leauing him in peaceable possession thereof, returned with his armie againe into Scotland, with great honor both to himselfe, the king, and realme.</p>
<p>Shortlie after was a parlement called, during the which the queene was crowned, and
manie good acts and constitutions made, especiallie touching the limiting of places where iustice should be ministred in the Iles and hie lands: whereby it came to passe, that the king

<p>But when the king perceiued his people to grudge herewith, and not without cause, as
with a thing deuised to disquiet his people and the whole countrie, of his owne curteous &amp;
gentle nature he easilie agr&eacute;ed with the possessors of such lands: for the which he purchased
great loue amongest his people, &amp; the deuisers of that ordinance wan passing great hatred and

was so conuersant in all hidden knowledge of naturall things, and in the secret science of
Alchumie, that he could turne all other mettals into pure gold, if anie would beare the charge
thereof. But after much time spent thereabout (with long looking of the king, and the nobilitie, to see the effect hereof) there was nothing doone, but that their pursses were emptied, and the vaine man was defamed by the breach of his promise. At length when he was
fallen into the hatred and offense of all men, he did (partlie to gather againe an opinion &amp;

laughed their fill, this woorthie abbat, to salue all the matter, referred the defalt of his
flieng whoile to his wings, because they were not made of eagles fethers and such like,

her. Because therefore he ment not to conclude anie thing in such a weightie matter without
consent of his confederats, of which he est&eacute;emed king lames as chiefe, he required him of
his aduise and counsell therein; who after aduisement taken, made answer, that albeit the

would friendlie giue the same: which was that he should rather marie his daughter within
his owne realme, vnto such as should succ&eacute;ed him, than to bestow hir vpon anie forren
prince, sith otherwise some claime might be made in time comming vnto the crowne by such
as should match with hir. And so with this answer, the president of Tholous departed,
reporting the same at his comming home vnto the French king, who therevpon followed

lieutenant of those men of warre which Charles the eight of that name king of France did
send with Henrie earle of Richmond into England, when the same earle came against king
Richard, whome he vanquished, and thereby got the crowne. And so after manie noble

with merchandize, &amp; loosing from the port of Sluis in Flanders, was inuaded by two armed

Pret. Which ship (after certeine of hir merchants slaine, manie wounded, manie taken
prisoners, and the rest cast into a fisher-bote to be set on land at the next shore) was by
them caried into Portingale: all which was doone in the sight of the rest of the Lusitan
ships, which at the same time did also loose out of that hauen to passe into Portigale. The
full trueth whereof, Charles the duke of Burgognie, and earle of Flanders, vnderstanding
(and mocued not so much for the singular iniurie doone to the Scots, as by the breach of
the priuilege, &amp; right of his liarborows) did signifie the same (knowne, and found by order
of iudgement) to the king of Portingale, admonishing him, that vnlesse he tooke order
for such wicked deeds, and for the restitution of the hurt and losse: that he would indeuor, that all the Portingals (which frequented the marts of Flanders) should by sentence
of iudgement, satisfie all the damages which the Scots had susteined. But the vntimelie
death (of that iust and valiant man) did frustrat all his determination.</p>

he gaue authoritie to lohn &amp; Robert Barton, brothers &amp; heires to that lohn, which was
maister of that ship so caried away, to recouer so much of the Lusitans. Before the execution wherof, my grandfather died: after which (my father being yet verie yoong) the whole

In which meane while, the ladie Katharine Gordon hir selfe remained in England, and had

the seas to meet the Portingals (against whom he had a letter of marque) sir Edmund Haward lord admerall of England, and the lord Thomas Haward, sonne and heire vnto the
earle of Surrey, were appointed by the king of England to go likewise to sea with certeine
ships, and met with the said Andrew as he returned homewards n&eacute;ere to the Downes, hauing
with him onelie one ship and one barke.</p>
<p>The Englishmen at the first made signe vnto the Scots as though they ment none euill,
saue onelie to salute them as friends; but getting within them, they set vpon them right
fiercelie, and the Scots for a while did as valiantlie defend themselues, so that manie were slaine
on both sides: but in the end the Englishmen got the vpper hand, wounded Andrew Barton
<note place="marg">Two ships taken by the Englishmen.</note>
the chiefe capteine of the Scots, that he died of the hurts that he there receiued, and the ship
called the Vnicorne, and the barke called Iennie Peruine, were both taken, with all the Scotishmen that remained aliue in the same, which were had to London, and staied as prisoners
in the bishop of Yorke his house for a time, and after sent home into Scotland. King
Iames was sore offended with this matter, and therevpon sent an herald with letters, requiring redresse for the slaughter of his people, and restitution of his ships, sith otherwise
it might s&eacute;eme to giue occasion of breach of the peace. But the king of England denied,
that the slaughter of a pirat (as he tooke Andrew Barton to be) ought to breake anie bond
of peace, yet neuerthelesse he promised to send commissioners to the borders, that should intreat of that matter, and other enormities chanced betweene the two realmes.</p>
<p>* About this time was Alexander Hume the onlie gouernor of all the marches of

Scotland (which before were accustomed to be diuided into thr&eacute;e parts) deerelie beloued to king
Iames, being a man of a fiercer disposition than was conuenient for the profit of the common-wealth. This man promised to the king (troubled with the cares of warre, and carefull
to wipe awaie the reproch of late receiued by the English) that shortlie he and his folowers
with their kindred and aliances, would so bring the matter about, that the English should
as greatlie lament for their losses, as they had now conceiued ioies of their victories. To the
performance whereof, he gathered thr&eacute;e thousand souldiers, wherewith he entered England,
and there spoiled seuen townes before anie succour might come to rescue them: but as he
returned backe laden with booties of all kinds, his men (being accustomed to pilfries and
robberies) impatient of delaie, presentlie diuided the preie in the host, euerie one departing
home to his owne as it was n&eacute;erest vnto him. Yet Alexander did not disperse such as he
might k&eacute;epe togither: but assembling as manie of them as would tarie, with a small companie abode the end of all things, alwaies hauing an eie to s&eacute;e if anie pursute were made
after them. But when he perceiued no bodie to follow, and that there was no doubt of
danger (passing the time more careles than before) he fell vnwares into the hands of thr&eacute;e
hundred English laid in wait for him, who (taking the opportunitie of the time) did set vpon
him and his, and (driuing them into extreme feare) they killed and put to flight all such as
they incountered. In which tumult diuers of the Scots were slaine, and two hundred taken,
of whome George Hume, brother of the said Alexander (exchanged for Comarch, Heron,
and Foord, taken prisoners, and long reteined in Scotland for reuenge of the death of Robert Car) was one, and the chiefest, whereby he departed quietlie into Scotland.)</p>
<p>The French king and the duke of Gelderland, perceiuing that the king of England was

but king Iames minding to mainteine peace and concord betwixt the parties, sent an

ambassador vnto the king of England, desiring him in brotherlie and most louing wise to liue in
peace and quietnesse, and not to make anie wars against his confederat friends, offering himselfe to agr&eacute;e and compound anie difference that was fallen betwixt the king of England
and the said princes. The king of England, who had alreadie sent aid vnto the ladie regent
of the low countries against the duke of Gelderland, made such faire answer herevnto as he
thought stood with reason, and so dispatched the ambassadour backe againe to his maister,
without anie more adoo in that matter, about the which he came for that time.</p>
<p>* Much about these daies, there was called a prouinciall synod of bishops, abbats, and

reuenues did y&eacute;erly exc&eacute;ed the value of 40 pounds) should pay a pension of the tenth to
the pope; and should giue to the king (when he required) such summes as he liked to demand: which vnto this day is called the Baiomane monie or tax.] Iohn lord Gordon, sonne

brought seuen awaie with him vnto Lieth for prises, in the which were but thr&eacute;e Englishmen left aliue. Shortlie after, maister Iames Ogiluie abbat of Driburgh came foorth of

powder, and wines, &amp; then was the league and band renewed betwixt Scotland and France.
The same ship landed at Blacknesse the ninet&eacute;enth of Nouember. King Iames sent a purseuant called Vnicorne into France, and another into England called Ilaie, which Ilaie required a safe conduct for an ambassador to be sent from the king his maister vnto the king

the assembling of his people, immediatlie after he had sent foorth his herald with commandement to denounce the warre, he determined to inuade the English confines, and first
before his maine force was come togither, the lord Humes that was lord chamberlaine and
warden of Scotland, the thirt&eacute;enth day of August, hearing that the Englishmen had fetched
<note place="marg">Englishmen fetched a bootie in Scotland.</note>
a bootie within the Scotish ground, assembled a power, &amp; followed them into Northumberland, but yer he could returne he was forelaid [in Broome house, or Broome field] by the
Englishmen, which breaking out of their ambushes, put the Scotishmen to the woorse, and
of them tooke and slue manie.</p>
<p>* These wars thus begun, the king determined to go to his armie (as it s&eacute;emeth) not
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
yet fullie assembled. Wherevpon comming to Limuch, he went to the church to heare
euensong; as the maner was. To whome, after he had entered the chappell, there came
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 13.</note>
an old man. whose heare was somewhat yellowish red, hanging downe vpon his shoulders,
his forehead high with baldnesse, bare headed, hauing his bodie couered with a biewish
garment, girded with white, and verie reuerent in his countenance. This man s&eacute;eking the
king, passed through the companie standing there, and drew neere to the king. Who
being now come vnto him (and with a certeine rude behauiour, leaning vpon the seat wherein
the king was placed) in homelie sort saied vnto him: "King Iames sent vnto th&eacute;e, to giue
thee admonishment that thou hasten not forward to the place which thou hast determined:
which warning if thou doost despise, it shall succeed ill with th&eacute;e, and with all such as
shall attend vpon th&eacute;e. Further I am commanded to giue th&eacute;e intelligence before hand,
that thou eschue the familiaritie, custome, or counsell of women, and if thou dooest otherwise, it shall succ&eacute;ed to thy hurt and reproch." After which thus spoken, he mingled

himselfe with the other companie, neither could after be found (the euensong being ended)
when he was sought for by the king: for he was neuer s&eacute;ene after that he had thus deliuered
his message. Which s&eacute;emed the more strange, because that manie which stood n&eacute;ere him
(marking all his order, and desirous to haue heard more things from him) could not perceiue his departure; amongest which persons (of those that meant to haue asked him further
questions) Dauid Lindseie (a man of approoued credit and vertue, verie well learned,
and whose life was far estranged from lieng and falshood) was one, who told this same to
me (saith Buchanan) as a thing most certeine; or else I would haue ouerpassed it as a fable
caried about by common report.]</p>
<p>In the meane time was the whole power of Scotland assembled, with the which king Iames
<note place="marg">King Iames approched n&eacute;ere vnto England with his power.</note>
approching to the borders, and nothing abashed with the euill lucke thus at the beginning
chanced to his people, purposed with greater aduantage of victorie to recouer that detriment; and herevpon he made such hast, that he would not staie for the whole power of
his realme, which was in preparing to come forward vnto him; but comming to the 
<note place="marg">The king of Scots made too much hast.</note>
borders, he passed ouer the water of Tw&eacute;ed the two and twentith of August, and entered into
England, lodging that night at Wesilham n&eacute;ere to the riuer of Tuisell, and the next day
laid siege vnto the castell of Norham, and within short space wan the Braies, ouerthrew the
<note place="marg">Norham.</note>

<note place="marg">The Braies.</note>

<note place="marg">Barnckine.</note>
Barnekine, &amp; slue diuerse within the castell, so that the capteine and such as had charge
within it, desired the king to delaie the siege, while they might send to the earle of Surreie
alreadie come with an armie into the north parts, couenanting if they were not rescued
by the ninet&eacute;enth day of that moneth, they should deliuer the castell vnto the king. This
was granted: and because none came within the time to the rescue, the castell was deliuered at the appointed day; a great part of it was ouerthrowne and beaten downe. After
this he wan the castels of Fourd and Etell, &amp; diuerse other places of strength, of which,
<note place="marg">Fourd and Etell taken.</note>
part were ouerthrowne. He also tooke manie prisoners, and sent them away into Scotland,
and diuerse he assured: and thus he abode an eight&eacute;ene daies within England, till two parts
of his armie were scaled &amp; departed home from him, which they did vpon this occasion.</p>
<p>* The king was determined &amp; persuaded to haue besieged Berwike (beyond which he
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
was now passed) since the same alone was more honor (than all the other places besides)
if they wan it; the taking whereof they supposed not to be verie hard, because they were
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. li.</emph> 13.</note>
sure that the towne and castell were vnfurnished of all things for the defense thereof.
Wherevpon, the king (deeming nothing too hard for his armie, especiallie, since the English were set on woorke as much as they might in the French wars) being nourished in
that vanitie (by his flattering courtiers) did leaue the same vndoone at this time, meaning
in his returne easilie to haue obteined it. But as they were yet at Foord, a herald of the
English came vnto them, requiring that they would appoint a day and place, where and
when both the armies might ioine in battell. Wherevpon, there was a councell called
amongest the Scots, in which it was agr&eacute;ed by the greater part, that the Scots should returne home into their countrie, least with so small a companie they might hazard the state
of the whole countrie; especiallie, since that they had alreadie sufficientlie obteined fame,
glorie and riches, and to the vttermost satisfied the band of amitie with the French; for
there was no iust cause, why they for number (so few) and for trauell (in ouerthrowing so
manie forts) so much weakened, should now againe be laid open to so great a multitude
of the English dailie increasing with succors. For it was said at that time; that Thomas
Haward brought into the field (besides the rest of his armie) 6000 of chosen and valiant
souldiers from the English campe (in France) before Turweine.</p>
<p>To which persuasion (to make the matter more strange) it was further added, that if
the king did depart; the English host of necessitie must be dissolued, and could not that
yeare againe be repared, because their souldiers were fet from the furthest parts of the
realme; and that if the king would needs fight, that he then should doo it in his owne
realme, k&eacute;eping the time &amp; place in his power alwaies to be appointed. But when the

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"French"</fw>-->

<pb n="478"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"478"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

French ambassador (and certeine other, fed with the French pensions) labored to the contrarie; the king being by nature fierce, and gr&eacute;edie of warre, was easilie persuaded to abide
his enimie in that place. In the meane time, when the English came not foorth (at the
day appointed to them by the herald, which before had b&eacute;ene with the Scots) the noblemen of Scotland, taking occasion thereof, did afresh go to the king, declaring that their
not comming to battell was onelie a traine and deceipt, deferring the matter from day to
day, to the end that their force might be increased, and the Scots diminished.</p>
<p>Wherefore said they, we should vse the like policie against them. For since they haue
not attended the time prescribed vnto them, it is no shame to the Scots to returne into their
countrie without battell, or to fight within their owne limits. Of both which, the surer
counsell were to follow the first; which if it be not liked, then is there good occasion
offered to execute the other. For since the riuer of Till (hauing hie banks) is not passable,
but at certeine miles hence (except it be by a bridge) some few may there resist a great
multitude. Besides which, when a part of the English armie is passed the bridge, the same
bridge maie easilie (by engins placed therefore) be cut in sunder; so that there shall not
be passage for anie more: by means whereof, the one part of them shall be subdued on
the one side of this riuer, before that anie aid can come vnto them from the other banke.
The king liked neither of these deuises and persuasions; but answered, that he would not
suffer the English to depart (vnfoughten with) although there were an 100000 against
him. At which rash answer, the whole nobilitie was gr&eacute;euouslie offended.</p>
<p>Wherevpon Archembald Dowglas earle of Angus (which farre excelled all the others
both in y&eacute;eres and authoritie) laboured to turne the kings mind with all gentle persuasions,
and began to make a more ample discourse vpon the two former counsels giuen by the
nobilitie. For he shewed that the king had fullie satisfied the request of the French, in that
he had now turned the greatest part of the English armie before bent against the French,
against himselfe and his owne people; and had so wrought, that those great armies should
neither hurt France nor doo anie iniurie vnto the Scots, sith they were not able long to remaine in campe in those cold places, and in a barren countrie vnfurnished of all things (by
the calamities of the last warres) and in which there was no corne; and if there were,
it could not be ripened (the winter comming on so fast) in those northerne parts of the
realme.</p>
<p>And where the French ambassador dooth so much vrge vs vnto the battell, I suppose that
the same should not seeme either new or strange vnto vs, that a strange man (which dooth
not respect the common euill of the realme, but the priuat commoditie of his owne nation)
be ouer lauish in powring out the bloud of other men. Besides which, his request is ouer
impudent, to demand of the Scots that which the French king (a man of singular experience
and wisedome) dooth not iudge conuenient for his owne kingdome or dignitie, if we be
ouerthrowne. Neither should the losse of his host s&eacute;eme more-light vnto him (although
we are few in number) bicause that all they of Scotland (which excell in force, authoritie
or counsell) are assembled here togither, who being slaine, the rest of the realme would
soone be a preie to the victor. What ? Is it more safe for vs, and more profitable to the
eschewing of all danger, for him to fight at this present ? No trulie. For if Lewes doo
suppose, that the English (by imagined meanes) may be either made needie of monie, or
else weried by delaie; what can be doone more necessarie for the present state of things,
than to compell the enimie to diuide his armie, to the end that we may ease the weight of
warre against the French by one part of the host to be sent against vs, and still to hold
them plaie as it were alwaies to k&eacute;epe them readie to set vpon vs, &amp; by remoouing to giue
them cause to folow vs? For so I suppose shall the glorie and shew (which these men I
feare rather valiant in words than d&eacute;eds, doo with their rashnesse so much pretend) be fullie
answered. For what can happen more honorable to the king, than that we (by the ouerthrow of so manie castels, by the spoile of so manie countries with sword and fire, and by

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"the"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"479"</fw>-->

the driuing home of so great booties and preies) haue doone that iniurie to them, as that
their countrie shall not by the peace of manie y&eacute;eres recouer hir former estate ? What
greater profit may we looke for by warres than in so great tumult of warres, with great praise
and honor to vs, and with shame and reproch to our enimies, to obteine quiet, ioined with
gaine and glorie for the refreshing of our selues ? Which kind of victorie (that is gotten
more by words than by swords) chieflie belongeth to men, and of men speciallie to the
leaders and capteins, as such a glorie whereof the common souldiors may not challenge anie
part.</p>
<p>Which being thus spoken by earle Dowglas, although all they which were present s&eacute;emed
(by their countenance) to giue consent thereto: yet the king (who had with other bound
himselfe to fight with the English) receiued these counsels with contrarie eares; and in heat
commanded Dowglas to depart home, if he were afraid of the enimie. Wherevpon he
(conceiuing some vnkindnesse, and inwardlie beholding wherevnto all these things would
come by the kings rashnesse) foorthwith burst out in teares. After which (as soone as he
could settle himselfe thereto) he spake these few words. "If (said he) my former life
did not cleare me from the reproch of a coward, I know not with what reason or persuasion
I might cleare or defend my selfe. For trulie so long as this my bodie was able to susteine
anie labor, I neuer spared to spend the same in the defense of my countries helpe, and my
souereignes honor. But since I s&eacute;e their eares to exclude my counsell (which is the onelie
thing wherewith I can now be profitable) I here leaue my two sonnes (who next vnto my
countrie are most deare to me) and the rest of my kinred (of whom I greatlie account) as
a certeine pledge of the truth and loue of my mind towards th&eacute;e, and the common helpe
of my countrie. And I pray God that he make this feare of mine to be false, and that I
may rather be counted a lieng prophet, than behold those things which I feare will happen
vnto vs." Which words when the Dowglas had said to the king, he departed thence with
his companie. The rest of the nobilitie (bicause they saw they could not draw the king to
their mind) tooke that place for battell which was next vnto them, to the end (s&eacute;eing they
were much inferior in number to their enimies, for there were 26000 fighting men in the
English armie, as it was knowne by the scouts) to defend themselues with the benefit of
the place, and therevpon got the hill next vnto their campe.)</p>
<p>In which meane time, the earle of Surrie, lieutenant to the king of England, hauing
<note place="marg">The power of the north countrie raised.</note>

<note place="marg">The English campe in sight of the Scotish campe.</note>
raised all the power of the north parts of England, came with the same towards the place
where he heard that king Iames was incamped, and approching within thr&eacute;e miles of the
Scotish campe in full sight of the Scotishmen, pitcht downe his tents, and incamped with
his whole armie. Although king Iames had great desire to fight with his enimies thus lodged
in full view of his campe; yet bicause he was incamped in a place of great aduantage, so as
the enimies could not approch to fight with him, but with great losse and danger to cast
themselues away, he thought good to k&eacute;epe his ground, speciallie bicause all those of the
<note place="marg">King Iames was minded to k&eacute;epe his ground.</note>
nobilitie, who were knowne to be of experience, did not hold with their aduise that counselled him to giue battell.</p>
<p>At what time the earle of Surrie had sent an officer at armes vnto him, requiring him to
<note place="marg"><emph>Paulus Iouius.</emph></note>
come foorth of his strength vnto some indifferent ground, where he would be readie to incounter him, &amp; namelie the earle of Huntleie, a man for his high valiancie ioined with 
<note place="marg">The earle of Huntleie his counsell.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
wisedome and policie, had in most reputation of all the residue, affirmed in plaine words [besides
that which Dowglasse had before said] that nothing could be either more fond or foolish,
than to fight at pleasure of the enimie, and to set all on a maine chance at his will and appointment, and therfore it should be good for them to remaine there in place of aduantage,
and with prolonging the time to trifle with the enimie, in whose campe there was alreadie
<note place="marg">His persuasions.</note>
great scarsitie of vittels, neither was it possible that they should be vittelled from the inner
parts of the realme, by reason of the cumbersome waies for cariage to passe now after
such abundance of continuall raine as of late was fallen, and not like as yet to ceasse, so that

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"in"</fw>-->

<pb n="480"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"480"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

in sitting still and attempting nothing rashlie without aduisement, the king should haue his
enimies at his pleasure, as vanquished without stroke striken through disaduantage of the
place, and lacke of vittels to susteine their languishing bodies.</p>
<p>And suerlie beside the want of vittels, the foule and euill weather sore annoied both
<note place="marg">Fonle weather.</note>
parties; for there had not beene one faire day, no scarse one houre of faire weather of all
the time the Scotish armie had lien within England, but great cold, wind &amp; raine, which
had not onelie caused manie of the Scots to returne home, but also sore vexed the Englishmen, as well in their iournie thitherwards, as also while they lay in campe against the Scotish
armie. There was sending of messengers betwixt them to and fro, and the king had sent
his quarell in writing vnto the earle of Surrie by his herald Ilaie the night before the battell,
conteining as followeth.</p>

<p><text><body>
<div1 type="letter">
<head><hi rend="smallcap">KING IAMES HIS QUARELL VNTO THE EARLE OF SURRIE.</hi></head>
<p>"<hi rend="smallcap">WHERE </hi>it is alledged that we are come into England against our bond and promise,
thereto we answer: that our brother was bound as farre to vs as we were to him, and when
we sware last before his ambassadors in presence of our councell, we expressed speciallie
in our oth, that we would keepe to our brother, if our brother kept to vs, and not else.
We sweare that our brother brake first to vs, and of his breach we required him diuers
times of amends: and latelie we warned him, as he did not vs yer we brake. And this
we take for our quarell, and by Gods grace shall defend the same at your affixed time,
which with Gods helpe we shall abide."</p></div1></body></text></p>

<p> &para; Thus was the king verie desirous to trie the
matter by battell, although the wisest sort of his nobles wished not that he should doo anie
thing ouer rashlie.</p>
<p>There chanced also manie things taken (as y&eacute;e would say) for warnings of some great
<note place="marg">Prodigious chances.</note>
mischance to follow, which though some reputed but as vaine and casuall haps; yet the
impression of them bred a certeine religious feare and new terror in his heart. For as he
was in councell with his lords, to vnderstand their opinions touching the order of his battels,
there was an hare start amongst them, which hauing a thousand arrowes, daggers, and
<note place="marg">An hare.</note>
other kind of things bestowed at hir, with great noise and showting, yet she escaped from
them all safe and without hurt. The same night also, mise had gnawne in sunder the
<note place="marg">The buckle leather of his helmet gnawn with mise.</note>

<note place="marg">The cloth of his tent of bloodie colour.</note>
buckle and leather of his helmet wherewith he should fasten the same to his hed. And
moreouer, the cloth or veile of his inner tent (as is said) about the breake of the day,
appeared as though the deawie moisture thereof had b&eacute;ene of a bloudie colour.</p>
<p>Herevpon the king k&eacute;eping himselfe within his tent, the earle of Surrie constreined by
necessitie to s&eacute;eke all waies whereby to traine the king downe from the hill where he was
lodged, remooued his campe towards the hils of Floddon, where the king of Scots laie 
<note place="marg">The English campe remooued by the earle.</note>
incamped: and on the ninth day of September passed the water of Till at Twisell bridge; the
rereward going ouer at Milford, putting themselues as n&eacute;ere as they could betwixt the
Scotish campe and Scotland. King Iames perceiuing the Englishmen to passe the water,
iudged that they had ment to win an hill that laie betwixt them and his campe, and therefore to preuent them, he caused his field to be raised, and fier to be set on the litter &amp; cabins
which they had made of boughs, and so with all sp&eacute;ed remooued to the other hill, being
<note place="marg">The Scots campe remcoued also.</note>
gotten thither yer the English men could perceiue him to be remooued out of his former
lodgings, bicause the smoke of the fiers which the Scots had made, couered all the countrie
betwixt the two armies.</p>
<p>In the meane while were the Englishmen aduanced to the foot of Floddon hill, hauing
<note place="marg">Aduantage gotten by the ground.</note>
thereby gotten double aduantage: for the Scotish ordinance could not much annoie them in
marching vpwards vnder the leuill thereof, and they againe might gall the Scots in shooting
off at them, as they came downewards vpon them. For king Iames hauing disappointed
<note place="marg">King Iames his practise.</note>

the Englishmen of the hill, thought verelie it should be an easie matter for him to ouerthrow them, which being put beside the place where they intended (as he thought) to haue
camped, would neuer abide the countenance of his puissant armie, if he might atteine to
ioine with them. Therefore the Scotish armie [after they had appointed the same into
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
thr&eacute;e wards, whereof (as saith Lesleus) the earle of Huntleie and the lord Hume led the
right wing, the left had the earle of Crawford and Montrosse; and the king himselfe kept
the middle ward, with the earles of Argile aud Lennox] making downwards, incountered
with the English host n&eacute;ere to the foot of the mounteine called Branxton, and first sir 
<note place="marg">Sir Edmund Haward was fiercelie assailed.</note>
Edmund Haward leading one of the out wings of the English armie, hauing with him thr&eacute;e
thousand men, being fiercelie assailed by the Scots on foot, hauing speares and long weapons,
and also by certeine horssemen, was in the end discomfited, and his people beaten downe
and put to flight, so that being of them forsaken, he was constreined to follow. But yet
he and diuerse other which escaped, ioined themselues to the next battell as well as they
might. This so prosperous a beginning, who would thinke should haue turned to the losse
<note place="marg">A good beginning had an euill ending.</note>

<note place="marg">King Iames deceiued himselfe and alighted from his horsse.</note>
of the Scots part, and aduancement of the English side. But so it came to passe, for king
Iames no sooner saw that wing of the English host ouerthrowne and discomfited, but that
he d&eacute;emed how all the whole power of the Englishmen had b&eacute;ene fl&eacute;eing away: and therefore alighting beside his horsse, and commanding those that were about him to follow,
prepared himselfe to pursue the chase.</p>
<p>His capteins did what they could by words to remooue him from his purpose, declaring
<note place="marg">The capteins good counsell not regarded.</note>
to him the dutie of a prince: which is not rashlie to enter the fight, but to prouide and s&eacute;e
that euerie thing be doone in order: and whereas comming to trie the matter by hand
blowes, he can doo no more than another man; yet keeping his place as apperteineth to his
person, he may be woorth manie thousands of other. The king nothing mooued with
these exhortations, breaking his arraie of battell, with a companie of noble men, rushed 
<note place="marg">The kings hardinesse marred all.</note>
forward into the fore ward, where accomplishing the office of a footman, he found the Englishmen not fl&eacute;eing, but manfullie standing at resistance, so that there was a right hard incounter, and manie arrowes shot on euerie side, and great hurt doone therewith.</p>
<p>At length sir Edward Stanlie with the reregard of the Englishmen came fiercelie downe
<note place="marg">Sir Edward Stanlie inuaded the backe of the reregard.</note>
from the hill of Branxton, vpon the backe of the kings armie, wherein they fought cruellie
on both parts for a long space; but at length the victorie inclined to the Englishmen.
For the king himselfe was there beaten downe and slaine, with all that whole battell which
<note place="marg">King Iames slaine.</note>

<note place="marg">The lord chamberlaine stood still.</note>
first entered the fight. The other part of the Scotish host, whereof Alexander Hume lord
chamberlaine had the gouernance, although he saw where the other Scotishmen were in
danger, and closed in on euerie side, yet would he not once remooue one foot forward out
of the place (where he stood) to aid them. Moreouer, the lacke of discretion in the king,
which would needs run vpon his owne death, amazed the minds of all men, and brought
them into such perplexitie, that they knew not what to doo; but looked one vpon another
without stirring to or fro, as those that were in despaire now after the death of their king to
recouer the victorie, which by so strange a chance s&eacute;emed as it were slipped out of their
hands.</p>
<p>Howbeit, the lord chamberlaine bare the most blame, for that he did not cause a new
<note place="marg">The lord chamberlaine beareth the blame.</note>
onset to be giuen. But it happened well for the Englishmen: for if king Iames had ordered
himself wiselie in this battell, or that after he was slaine, a new furie had mooued the
Scots to haue renewed the fight in reuenge of the kings death, as had beene expedient,
the victorie vndoubtedlie had b&eacute;ene theirs (as was thought by men of great vnderstanding.)
Wherevpon the Englishmen remembring how manifestlie Gods goodnesse appeared towards
<note place="marg">The English men thanked God for this noble victorie.</note>
them in this battell, confessed themselues long after bound to God for their safetie and
deliucrance out of that present danger. The fight began about foure of the clocke in the
after noone, and continued thr&eacute;e houres, in the which fift&eacute;ene thousand men were slaine on

reported) but (as our English writers affirme) there died of Englishmen not past fift&eacute;ene
hundred.</p>
<p>But yet the Scotishmen hold, that there died more of the Englishmen than of their nation
at this field, and that manie thought it was not the bodie of king Iames which the Englishmen found in the field, and tooke it for his; but rather an other Scotish mans corps, called
the lard of Bonehard, who was also slaine there. And it was affirmed by sundrie, that the
king was seene the same night aliue at Kelso: and so it was commonlie thought that he
was liuing long after, and that he passed the seas into other countries, namelie to Ierusalem
to visit the holie sepulchre, and so to driue foorth the residue of his daies, in dooing penance for his former passed offenses: but he appeared not in Scotland after as king, no more
than Charles duke of Burgognie did appeare in his countries after the battell of Nancie,
although his people had the like vaine opinion that he escaped from that discomfiture
aliue.</p>
<p>But now to returne to the truth of the matter where we left. In the night folowing after
this terrible battell, the residue of the Scotish armie returned homewards the same way they
<note place="marg">The Scotish men returne home againe.</note>

<note place="marg">They were reuiled of their owne people.</note>
came, wasting and spoiling the English borders as they passed. At their comming home,
euerie man spake euill of them, for that as cowards and naughtie persons, they neither
sought to reuenge the death of their noble king, nor yet to succour their fellowes that were
beaten downe and slaine before their faces. But namelie Alexander Hume lord chamberlaine was reprooued, as cause of all that mischiefe, which behaued himselfe not as a capteine,
but as a traitor or enimie to his countrie. * Vpon the honor of this victorie, Thomas

<p>Thus haue you heard how through rashnesse and lacke of skilfull order, the Scotish
armie was ouercome, and that worthie prince king Iames the fourth brought to his fatall
end, on the ninth day of September, in the twentie and fift y&eacute;ere of his reigne, and thirtie
and ninth of his age, which was in the y&eacute;ere from the incarnation 1513. For his politike
gouernment and due administration of iustice, which he exercised during the time of his
reigne, h&eacute;e deserued to be numbred amongest the best princes that euer reigned ouer the Scotish
nation. All theft, reiffe, murther, and robberie ceassed in his daies, by such rigorous 
<note place="marg">The sauage people reformed themselues.</note>
execution of lawes penall as he caused to be exercised through all the bounds of Scotland:
insomuch that the sauage people of the out Iles sorted themselues through terror and dread
of due punishment to liue after the order of lawes and iustice, where otherwise of themselues
they are naturallie inclined to sedition, &amp; disquieting of each other. To conclude, men
were in great hope, that if it had pleased the hie determinate power of almightie God to
haue lent to him longer life, he should haue brought the realme of Scotland to such a
flourishing estate, as the like in none of his predecessors times was yet euer heard of.</p>
<p>There died with him in that infortunate battell, of noble men (beside others of the meaner
sort) the archbishop of saint Andrewes his bastard sonne, the bishop of the Iles: the abbats
of Inchaffreie and Kilwennie: the earles of Montrosse, Crawford, Argile, Lennox, Glencar,
Cathnes, Castelles, Bothwell; Arrell high constable of Scotland, Addell, Atholl, and Morton: the lords Louet, Forbois, Elueston, Roos, Inderbie, Saintcleare, Maxwell, and his thr&eacute;e
brethren, Daunlie, Sempill, Borthicke, Bogonie, Arskill, Blackater, and Cowin: knights
and gentlemen of name, sir Iohn Dowglas, Cuthbert Hume of Fast castell, sir Alexander

knowledge whereof in times past was a thing common to all the nobilitie, being alwaies
vsed to the warres. He was easilie to be spoken vnto, gentle in his answers, iust in his
iudgements, and so moderat in punishments, that all men might easilie s&eacute;e he was vnwillinglie
drawen vnto them. Against the detraction of the euill, and admonishment of the good,
there was such woorthinesse of mind in him (confirmed by the quiet of a good conscience,
and the hope of his innocencie) that he would not onelie not be angrie, but not so much
as vse a sharpe woord vnto them. Amongest which vertues, there were certeine vices crept
in by the ouermuch desire to please the people, for whilest he labored to auoid the note
of couetousnesse (obiected to his father) and sought to win the fauour of the common sort
(with sumptuous feasts, gorgeous shewes, and large gifts) he fell into that pouertie, that
it seemed (if he had liued long) that he would haue lost the fauor of his people (woone
in old times) by the imposition of new taxes. Wherefore his death was thought to haue

<p>The qu&eacute;ene sent louing letters vnto the king of England hir brother, requiring him of
peace. Wherevpon a truce was taken betwixt the two realmes of England and Scotland,
for the space of one y&eacute;ere and a day. In the beginning of Februarie, the king of England,

to haue him gouernor, which was to succ&eacute;ed, if hir son were once out of the way. But
the chiefest cause that mooued the king of England to lahour, that the duke should hauo
nothing to doo in Scotland, was (as manie thought) for that he knew how the duke, in
fauour of the king of France, would shew himselfe an enimie against England, with all
the force he might make or procure.</p>
<p>Now shortlie after that the peace was concluded betwixt him and the king of France, he

<p>The foure and twentith of Februarie, a parlement was assembled at Striueling; but because the lords could not agr&eacute;e amongst themselues, it was proroged till the comming of the

<p>In the meane time, whilest this parlement was in hand, the gouernor was aduertised
that the king should haue b&eacute;ene conueied foorth of the realme secretlie into England:
wherevpon he suddenlie departed in the night time from Edenburgh, with his men of warre
in good order, &amp; came to Striueling, where the king, with his brother Alexander, laie

qu&eacute;ene against the gouernor, was denounced a rebell; and the earles of Lennox &amp; Arrane,
with manie others, were sent to his houses to seize the same into the kings hands. In the
castell of Hume was laid gunpowder by a traine, wherby diuerse of them that entered first
into the castell were burned.</p>
<p>The lord Hume himselfe got him into England, and sore disquieted the marches, so
that no day of truce was holden, neither on the east nor middle marches. The twelfth of
August, the qu&eacute;ene, the earle of Angus, and his brother George Dowglas, went from
Temptallon vnto Berwike, and from thence passed to the nunrie of Caudstreame; wherevpon aduertisement being giuen to the K. of England, and his pleasure therein knowne, the

And in that meane space, the gouernor went to besiege the castell of Hamilton, where that

<p>In the moneth of September, the gouernor commanded the lord Hume, with his brother
<note place="marg">The lord Hume and other arrested and committed to ward.</note>
maister William Hume, and Dauid Kar of Fernihurst, to be arrested and bestowed in seuerall places, that better rule might be kept vpon the borders: but they lieng now in ward,
sundrie informations were giuen vp against them: and therevpon, the eight of October, the
said lord Hume and his brother were conuict of treason, for assisting and mainteining of the
th&eacute;eues vpon the borders, and other crimes; for the which he was beheaded: and on the
morrow after, his brother the foresaid William Hume was likewise beheaded, and their heads

those times gr&eacute;euouslie afflicted with diuerse misfortunes. For George, being banished for
the slaughter of a man, remained in England amongest his friends. Iohn abbat of ledwoorth
was banished beyond Taie. Dauid the yoonger brother, which was prior of Coldingham
two yeares after the death of his brethren, was (by Iames Hepborne, the husband of his
sister) slaine by a traine, vnder color of a meeting and parl&eacute;e, wherevnto he was called;
whome all men did pittie, because he was a harmelesse yoong gentleman, of a singular wit,
and fowlie betraied by those of whom he ought not so to haue bin intrapped.</p>

to k&eacute;epe good rule in those parts, and so returned to Edenburgh. The third of Nouember,
another parlement was holden, in which it was decr&eacute;ed, that the gouernor should be d&eacute;emed and reputed for second person of the realme, notwithstanding the claime made by his
elder brother Alexander Steward, that was begotten on the daughter of the earle of Orkeneie, which was alleged to haue b&eacute;ene first maried to their father the duke of Albanie, before
he was maried to the earle of Bullognes daughter, on whome he begot the gouernor. Wherevpon this Alexander made protestation to be heire to his father; but they were afterward
agr&eacute;ed, and Alexander renounced his title in his brothers fauor, and was made bishop of
Murreie, and abbat of Scone. At this parlement, the gouernor required licence to go into
<note place="marg">The gouernor asketh licence to go into France.</note>

la Bautie was made warden of the east marches in stead of the lord Hume, and kept daies of
truce: which procured such hatred, that it cost him afterwards his life. In the moneth of

the lord Fleming for the time was made great chamberlaine of Scotland, with all the f&eacute;es

<p>He also had caused the king to be brought into Edenburgh castell, within the which he
<note place="marg">Gouernors appointed to the kings person.</note>
should remaine in the k&eacute;eping of the earle Marshall, die lords Erskin, Borthwike, Rithuen;
of the which, two at least should be alwaies present. The qu&eacute;ene that remained as then
in England, after she vnderstood that the gouernor was departed towards France, returned to Edenburgh the seuent&eacute;enth of Iune, but she was not suffered to s&eacute;e the king till
August following: at what time, for feare of the pestilence to be crept into the castell, he

<note place="marg">The doubt which the Scots had in the qu&eacute;ene.</note>
was remooued to Cragmiller, where the queene oftentimes came vnto him; but at length,

with the gouernor) was singularlie welcomed and interteined of all men, who going vnto his
owne people (in the north parts) was vrged with such grieuous sickenesse that he died therwith, and by his father (to whom he should by course of nature execute the same office) shortlie after buried in the abbeie of Kilrosse, with a goodlie toome erected on him by
his said father. The death of which Iohn gaue (for manie causes) manie griefes vnto
manie persons: but amongst other the chiefest to his father, who liued not long after his
sonne. Which Alexander when he died, left the said earledome to his nephue, sonne of his
sonne Iohn; who bicause he was but ten y&eacute;eres old, was committed to the earle of Angus,
to be instructed in all goodnesse of maners answering to the excellencie of that wit wherewith
he was indued.</p>
<p>This earle Huntleie adorned with excellent sw&eacute;etnesse of maners and pleasantnesse of wit,
the earle of Angus would neuer or verie hardlie suffer to depart out of his companie. For
which cause when the erle of Angus, for certeine suspicions of treson was banished Scotland into England, he attempted by all deuises and persuasions to intise the child to haue
gone with him: but the yoong boie could not be allured with anie flatteries or persuasions to
submit himselfe to the least note of reproch, in forsaking his king and countrie. Wherefore when the earle of Angus was departed into England, the child lifting vp his crauing
hands to the king, did grant himselfe and all he had to the king and his countrie, whome the
king receiued with all kind of humanitie; and prouided that he should be instructed in
euerie sort of vertue and learning, that was to be desired in such a prince; bicause the said
child was borne of his sisters mariage.</p>
<p>The lords and other nobles highlie offended (as well for the death of the lord Hume, as

for that they saw Anthonie Darcie lord Bautie the French aduanced to greater credit than
themselues, and not onelie to be made warden of the marches, but also capteine of Dunbreton the strongest fort of Scotland) began to raise tumults in the land. For William
Cockborne (yncle of Comarch Lancton) who (expelling the gardians of the pupill) did
keepe the castell of Lancton, assisted with the helpe of Dauid Hume lord of Woodburne
(whose sister the said Cockborne had maried) first began a commotion in those parts.
For when they saw that all means were taken from them openlie to reuenge the same,
and to set vpon Bautie, they determined to performe the same (with some secret deuise) by
lieng in wait for him.</p>
<p>For the castel of Langton or Lancton, being kept in the possession of Woodburne (and

feining a counterfeit anger (for he was a man full of all subtiltie) that this castell was so
iniuriouslie taken from him, and kept to the kings behoofe, he laid siege to the castell (as
though he went about to recouer the same with all the power he could) to the intent that
Bautie might be intised to come thither to raise the siege. For which cause Bautie (

<p>The lords regents were herewith meruelouslie offended, &amp; chose the earle of Arrane to be
warden of the borders in de la Bauties place, who was also chosen to be prouost of Edenburgh:
wherewith the earle of Angus was highlie displeased. But the erle of Arrane, not s&eacute;eming to
passe much thereof, tooke George Dowglas the said earle of Angus his brother, and Marke Kar,
committing them to ward within the castell of Edenburgh, bicause of the fauor he bare vnto
the said lord of Woodburne &amp; his complices. Moreouer, for due punishment of the murther

Iohn Hume, with diuerse other their partakers, were indicted for the besieging of the castell

<p>Immediatlie after the end of this parlement, the earle of Arrane came into the Mers, with

a great armie, and hauing with him the kings great artillerie, ment to haue besieged such

for the perpetuall vpholding thereof. He also builded two steeples in the cathedrall church,
with halfe of the crosse church, and a faire palace for the small prebendaries, called the chapleins. Moroouer, he bestowed manie rich &amp; pretious ornaments vpon the same church of Abberden, as copes, chalices, and other such like things, which remained there long after. Manie

the earle of Angus hir husband, as then soiourning in Dowglas dale, had taken a faire gentlewoman in those parts, and kept hir as his concubine; for the which act she conceiued
such hatred against him, that there was neuer no perfect loue betwixt them afterwards. In
the beginning of Februarie, there came a clearke as ambassador from the French king with
letters, concerning the concluding of the truce betwixt Scotland and England, which
message the lords made small account of, bicause the king had omitted to comprehend Scotland in the league which he lastlie made with England. The seuenth of June, a mad man

<p>Herevpon, great dissention rose betwixt the said earle of Arrane, and the earle of Angus,
<note place="marg">Dissention betwixt the earles of Arrane and Angus.</note>
bicause of his repulse in that sute: whereby the whole realme was diuided into partakings,
so that sundrie slaughters thereof insued, as of the prior of Coldingham, and six of his
men murthered, by the lord of Woodburne at Lamerton, the sixt of October. About the
same time, the king returned to the castell of Edenburgh, and in the towne there were remaining at the same time the earles of Angus, Erroll, and Crawford; the lord Glames, and
other; the bishops of saint Andrews, Abberden, Orkenie, and Dublane, with diuerse abbats
and other prelats. And in the towne of Glascow was the bishop of Glascows chancellor,
with the earles of Arrane, Lennox, Eglenton, and Cassels; the lords Rosse, Sempill, the
abbat of Pasley, the bishop of Galloway, and other noble men of the west. Thus the lords
were diuided, and would not take anie order for the good gouernment of the commonwealth.</p>
<p>In December, monsieur de la Faiot, and a French clearke called Cordell, with an English

herald called Clarencieux, came from the kings of France and England, with an ambassador
also from the gouernor, with a conclusion of peace taken for one y&eacute;ere, betwixt Scotland

other lords there with him, the which sent for the chancellor &amp; the earle of Arrane to come
thither; but they would not come anie n&eacute;erer than to Linlithgo. The ambassador therefore
tooke in hand to persuade, that an assemblie might be had in Striueling: but the earle of
Angus would not come there. Neuerthelesse, the said ambassadors went thither, where
the earle of Arrane and his partakers, as the chancellor and others, receiued them thankfullie, and proclamed the peace, according to the treatie which they had brought, and so
<note place="marg">The peace proclamed.</note>
with courteous answer and great rewards licenced them to depart. But in their returne
toward England, the earle of Angus with a great number of men met them at Carlauerok,
reproouing them sharpelie for their demeanor, and for taking their answer of the chancellor,
so that they were not a litle afraid, least the earle in his displeasure would haue vsed some
outrage towards them, which otherwise than in woords it should app&eacute;ere he did not.</p>

vnto Hume, with losse of foure of his seruants which were slaine: and on the other part,
there was an Englishman slaine called Rafe Kar, that came in aid of the warden. On the
morrow after, the lord of Fernihurst, as baliffe to the earle of Arrane, of that regalitie,
held his court at the principall place of the forrest of Iedburgh, and the earle himselfe held
his court likewise in an other part of the same land, thr&eacute;e miles distant from the other.</p>
<p>The thirtieth day of Aprill, the lord of Woodburne, and maister William Dowglasse,
newlie made prior of Coldingham, with their partakers in great numbers, came to Edenburgh to aid the earle of Angus, who was within the towne, against the earle of Arrane,
and Iames Beton the chancellor, who were also there. But now by the comming of these
succors, which entered by force at the neather bowe, and slue the maister of Mountgomerie,
sonne of the earle Eglenton, and sir Patrike Hamilton knight; the earle of Arrane, and the
chancellor, were constreined to forsake the towne, &amp; to passe through the north loch.

in hope to haue found the chancellor, and some other of that faction there. But missing
of their purpose, they returned to Edenburgh againe, and causing solemne funerall obsequies to be kept in the blacke friers, for them that owght those heads, with offerings and

<p>The king of England, hearing that the duke of Albanie was arriued in Scotland, and had
taken the rule vpon him, doubting least he should persuade the Scotishmen to assist the

And as touching the king, who was as yet yoong in y&eacute;eres, he loued him as his souereigne
lord, and would keepe him, and defend both him and his realme against all other that
would attempt to inuade the same, according to his conscience, honor, and dutie. And as
touching the earle of Angus, he had vsed towards him all clemencie and mercie, notwithstanding his euill demerits, and that principallie for the qu&eacute;enes cause, whome he would
honor as mother to his souereigne lord. This answer being reported vnto the king of
England, contented him nothing at all, and therefore prepared to make warre.</p>
<p>The tenth of Aprill, there came seuen great ships into the Forth, vnto Inchkeith, to haue

spoiled the ships, and inuade the coast there: but they were so stoutlie resisted and kept
off, that they were not suffered to doo anie great exploit, and so they returned without
preie or prise. In this season, Andrew Forman bishop of saint Andrewes deceassed, and

there was great adoo in Edenburgh, by the falling out of the seruants of the earles of Murrey
and Erroll, with the seruants of the earle of Huntleie, by reason whereof, the whole towne

a white crosse sowed vpon their vppermost garment. In Iulie, the earle of Shrewsburie was
sent by the king of England vnto the borders, with commission, to raise the power of the
north parts to inuade Scotland, who vpon the sudden entered and came to Kelso, where
he burnt one part of the towne; but the borderers of the Mers and Teuidale, not being
halfe so manie in number as the other, set vpon them, slue, and tooke manie prisoners, and
so constreined them to returne into England with small honor.</p>
<p>* The gouernor after this (when he saw the English ouerrun all the borders of Scotland)
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 9. <emph>pag.</emph> 400.</note>
called a parlement at Edenburgh, the 9 kalends of August, to cure the same wound. Beside this, the French fearing themselues (because of a prepared and well furnished nauie
of the English which did euerie waie couer and k&eacute;epe the sea) sent manie (and those
wise and of excellent knowledge) vnto the gouernor, to request him that he would either
by counseil persuade, or by authoritie inforce his Scots to take armor against the English.
After which (the matter being with great consultation and manie reasons tossed in argument

to and fro) it was decr&eacute;ed by common consent of the parlement, that a chosen number of
souldiers should be prepared, to defend the borders from the inuasion of the enimie, &amp;
(the more stronglie to repell the English force) it was concluded, that the children of
such as were slaine in that expedition, should be freed from all charges or troubles that
might light on them during their minorite: and further, that the wiues of all such which had
anie lands (during their liues &amp; fell in that conflict) should after the death of their husbands
k&eacute;epe the same for the terme of flue yeeres.)</p>
<p>The duke of Albanie, hearing of the great preparation that the earle of Shrewesburie made,
to raise an armie of foure score thousand men to inuade Scotland, he likewise (as it was
before decr&eacute;ed) sent vnto all the earles, lords, and nobles of the realme, wiling them to
<note place="marg">The duke of Albanie raiseth an armie to inuade England.</note>
raise all such power as they could make in defense of their countrie; which they did,
And so being assembled, the duke with a mightie armie of Scotishmen and certeine Frenchmen, with great artillerie, marched forward, till he came to the water of Eske ouer against
Carleill: and perceiuing that the English armie came not then forward, he did what he
could to persuade the noble men to enter into England: but as they were in councell togither
about that earnest motion made to them by the duke, a certeine graue personage said to
them in this maner.</p>
<p>"My lards, hither we be come by the commaundement of my lard gouernor duke of
<note place="marg">The woords of a councellor.</note>
Albanie, and albeit we be readie to defend our awne natiue realme, contrarie the inuasioun
of our auld enimies of Englaund, yet neuerthelesse it s&eacute;emeth not guid, nor for the w&eacute;ele
of our realme of Scotlaund, to passe within Englaund with our armie to inuade the same
at this time. And the earnest persuasiouns quhilk the gouernor makes to vs to doo the
same, proc&eacute;edes alanerlie for the pleasure of France. It app&eacute;ereth to be sufficient inough
for vs so lang as the king our souereigne lard is within age to defend our awn realme,
and not to inuade: otherwise, we may put the haile countrie and nobilitie thereof in hazard
of tintsall: for king Iames the fourth brought the realme of Scotlaund to the best that it
euer was, and by the war it was brought to the woorst almost that might be: for by that
warre, was he and his nobilitie tinte, quhilk Scotlaund sare laments. Wherefore by mine
aduise, let vs go to the gouernor, and know of him the cause why he wauld persuade vs
to inuade Englaund."</p>
<p>Then they all came to the gouernors tent, and the earle of Arrane, an auncient wise
<note place="marg">The earle of Arrane declareth to the gouernor the mind of the lords.</note>
man spake for them all, and said: "My lard gouernor, by your will and commaundement, h&eacute;ere is assembled the maist of the nobilitie of Scotlaund with their power, vpon a
pretense to enter within Englaund. My lards h&eacute;ere wauld know the cause and quarrell
why this warre is begun, gif it might please your goodnesse, it should well satisfie their
minds." The duke studied a little space, and said: "This questioun wauld half bin 
<note place="marg">The dukes answer to the earle of Arrane.</note>
demaunded yer now; for well you know, that I for verie lufe I beare to the realme of Scotlaund (of the quhilk I haue my name, honor, and lignage) haife passed the seas from the
noble realme of France, into this realme of Scotlaund. And great cause there was for me so
to doo, to bring you to a vnitie, when ye ware in diuisioun, by reasoun whereof, your realme
was like to haue bin conquered and destroied. And also the king of Fraunce, by my
suites and intercessioun, will ioine with you in aid against the English natioun: and when
this warre was determinate in the parlement, you made me capteine, authorizing me to inuade
Englaund with banner displaied. Then was no demaund made of the cause or quarrell,
and that I haif doone, is by your assent and agreement, and that I will iustifie. But to
answer your demaund, me thinke you haif iust cause to inuade Englaund with fire,
swoord, and bloud, gif ye be not forgetfull, and without you will beare dishonor and
reproch for euer. For ye know that this realme of Scotlaund is our inheritauace, as a
portioun of the world allotted to our natioun and auncestors whome we succ&eacute;ed. Then
where may there be better warre, than to mainteine this our naturall inheritance? Is it
not dailie s&eacute;ene, the great inuasiouns that the Englishmen on vs make, the great manslaughters and murders, with thefts and spoiles that they doo dailie? Is not this one cause

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"of"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"495"</fw>-->

of warre? To defend the countrie is the office of a king, the honor of noble men, and the verie
seruice of chiualrie, and the dutie naturall of the communalde: for I thinke it a iust quarrell, gif we might conquer the realme of Englaund, and annex it to our owne realme, for the
great iniuries and wrongs doone by that natioun to vs and our predecessors. For s&eacute;ene the
begining of our habitatioun in this Ile of Britaine, the Englishmen and we haue euer bin
enimies, and vs haif they euer hated, and yet haue we euer withstand them. Suppose, we at
the last battell of Floddoun field by chaunce lost our souereigne lard, &amp; diuerse noble men,
quhilk was rather by treasoun of the lard chamberlaine, than otherwise, who would not relieue the kings armie when he might. And yet I thinke we wan the field, quhilk murder all
we noble men ought to reuenge. Therefore I wauld that you suld couragiouslie aduance
your selues in this quarrell to get honor, and to be reuenged."</p>
<p>Then one wise man that was president of the councell, answered the gouernor, saieng: "My
<note place="marg"><date>1522.</date></note>

<note place="marg">The replie of a wise councellor.</note>
lard, fortune of weir is led by him that all leides, and he striks the strake, we can warke na
meracles, &amp; heare are the lards of Englaund readie to incounter vs. And gif we inuade their
realme, suerlie they will fight, for their power sall increase dailie, and ours will diminish. And
gif God graunt vs the victorie (as I trust he sall) yet haue we not woon the field, for readie
comming is the earle of Shrewesburie sa mikell dread in Fraunce (as ye knaw well) with an
great puissant armie, and there is na doubt, but the king of Englaund will send or bring
another armie gif we suld chance to get the first battell. And gif we get the secound field,
that will not be without great losse of manie nobles, by reasoun whereof, the realme shall be
weaker. And gif we be ouercommen how manie suld be slaine, God knawes. They that
fl&eacute;e are woorthie to be reputed as traitors to the king, and so by wilfulnesse and fule hardinesse, the realme may be in ieopardie to be vndoone. I say, while the king is within age, we
aught to mooue na weir, least by weir we may bring him to destructioun."</p>
<p>Then said the valiant gouernor: "H&eacute;ere is an puissaunt armie of Scotlaund, gif we 
<note place="marg">The gouernors words to the presidents replie.</note>
returne, we sall incourage our enimies. Therefore s&eacute;ene you thinke it not gude to inuade, my
councell is that we campe still on the bordures, while we s&eacute;e what the Englishmen pretends
to doo against our relme." To the which the nobles consented, and laie still there in campe
certeine daies after. After this conference had betwixt the nobles and the gouernor, the
qu&eacute;ene as then being not with them, but aduertised of all the proc&eacute;edings and determinations, sent woord to the gouernor, and desired him that there might be a treatie of peace

had, and she promised to get the warden of the English marches to come to the gouernors
campe, vpon pledges, whervnto the gouernor condescended. H&eacute;erevpon, the lord Dacres,
<note place="marg">The lord Dacres.</note>
warden of the west marches of England [with Thomas Musgraue] came vnto the gouernors
campe, and thither also at that time was the qu&eacute;ene hir selfe come, and so vpon the eleuenth
of September, an abstinence of war was taken and couenanted, that in the meane time the
duke and qu&eacute;ene should send ambassadors into England, to treat and conclude a resolute
peace.</p>
<p>In the moneth of October next insuing, there were thr&eacute;e ambassadors sent into England,
according to the agreement in the last treatie, but there were so hard and extreame conditions
proponed on the king of Englands behalfe, that the same could not be accepted, as being
contrarie to the honor and weale of the realme of Scotland, as the Scotishmen tooke the matter. And so those ambassadors returned without agr&eacute;ement or conclusion of peace: wherevpon followed great trouble betwixt them of the borders of both realmes. The earle of 
<note place="marg">The earle of Northumberland made lord warden.</note>

<note place="marg">The earle of Surreie.</note>

<note place="marg">The lord marques I orset.</note>

<note place="marg">The lord Dacres.</note>
Northumberland was made warden of the whole marches, but shortlie after, he began to make
sute to be discharged of that office, &amp; ceassed not till he obteined it: and then was the earle
of Surreie made generall warden, and the lord marquesse Dorset warden of the east &amp;
middle marches; the lord Dacres continuing still in his office of wardenship ouer the west
marches.</p>
<p>About the sixt day of March, the said lords came to the borders, about which time, the
duke of Albanie considering that the warres betwixt Scotland and England were irksome to
the nobles of the realme, because the same wars were taken in hand chieflie to serue the

French kings turne, therefore he passed by the west seas into France. And in the 
<note place="marg">The duke of Albanie goeth ouer into France.</note>

<note place="marg">His request.</note>

<note place="marg">His vaine brag.</note>
beginning of March, where he was verie hartilie and gladlie receiued of the king, his request was
onelie to haue fiue thousand horssemen, and ten thousand footmen of Almains, to be transported into Scotland: and doubted not, if he might haue this granted, but that with that
power, and the assistance of the Scots, he should be able to ouerthrow the king of Egland
in battell, or else to driue him out of his realme. But the French king neither beleeued
this vaine brag, nor yet might spare anie such power, hauing warre at that time both against
England, and the emperor: neuerthelesse, he promised him some aid, wherevpon the duke
abode and waited for the same a long season. In the meane while, the lords of Scotland
<note place="marg"><date>1523.</date></note>

<note place="marg">The borders watched.</note>
caused certeine noble men to lie vpon the borders monethlie, in defense of the same against
the Englishmen, dailie looking for support from France. Euerie companie remained their
moneths, and then departed home as the custome is, and thus they continued still till September following. Much hurt was doone on either part, and diuerse houses were ouerthrowne
and destroied both in England and Scotland.</p>
<p>During which time, the king of France prepared certeine ships, with men, and munition,
to passe with the duke of Albanie into Scotland. But the king of England, to catch him by
the way, had laid a great nauie of ships in the pase on the seas, as he should make his course.
But the duke embarquing himselfe with his people at Brest in Britaine, sailed by the west parts
<note place="marg">The duke of Albanie returneth into Scotland.</note>
of Scotland: and the one and twentith day of September landed at Kirkowbre in the west
part of Scotland; he brought with him (beside a good number of Frenchmen) Richard de
la Poole, a man of great parentage, borne in England, and banished his countrie. Whilest
the duke was on the sea making saile toward Scotland, the earle of Surreie, with an armie
of twentie thousand men, entered into Scotland, and comming to Edenburgh, burned the
towne and the abbeie. [But Lesleus, lib. 9. pag. 407. saith it was Iedwoorth which the
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg">The earle of Surreie inuadeth Scotland.</note>
earle burnt.] It was thought they ment to haue passed further, but the Scotishmen assembling themselues against their inuasions, they were constreined to returne with losse (as
some Scotishmen haue written.)</p>
<p>*In this place, Buchanan (before he commeth to the parlement assembled by the duke
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
of Albanie after his returne out of France) writeth in this sort. We haue shewed (saieth
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 14.</note>
he) how miserable the state of Scotland was the last summer (through the dissention which
was amongest the nobilitie) by the English (with all kind of slaughter) spoiling the places
bordering n&eacute;ere vnto them, and besetting the sea on euerie side, whereby we might be out
of hope of all forren aid. For the deuise of the enimie tended to compell the fierce minds
of the Scots (abated with such euils) to conclude a league with him; wherewith the Scots
were not behind (by reason of the French faction) that by the means of the qu&eacute;ene there
might be a perpetuall truce taken betw&eacute;ene them. For when the lord Hume was (by death)
taken away, the Dowglasse banished, and all the rest of the nobilitie rather m&eacute;et for companions than leaders in battells; such as had withdrawen their mind from the French, applied themselues to the qu&eacute;enes faction.</p>
<p>Wherevpon she (to gratifie hir brother, and to wrest all the gouernement into hir owne
hands) did (dissembling hir gr&eacute;edie desire to rule) persuade them, to deliuer their sonne
(almost now past childish yeares) out of the hands of strangers, and them selues from the
yoke of other mens bondage. For the queene did well fors&eacute;e, that preparation and succor
was made, and did come against hir husband, whome before she had begun to hate extreamlie. The king of England also did commend and prefer to the Scots the counsell of his
sister, by manie letters sent, and with faire promises offered; because he had none other
mind, but that a perpetuall friendship might alwaies remaine betw&eacute;ene the adioined kingdoms;
the which, as he had at other times desired; so now mostlie he wished it, not for anie commoditie to himselfe, but to the end that all men might well perceiue that he would imbrace, defend, and asmuch as rested within his abilitie, s&eacute;eke the commoditie of his sisters sonne by
all the means he might. And if the Scots would persuade themselues to breake the league
with the French, and ioine in amitie with the English; they should shortlie well vnderstand,

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"that"</fw>-->

<pb n="497"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"497"</fw>-->

that the king of England did not seeke after souereingtie, glorie, power, or honor; but
onelie studied for a concord amongst themselues, &amp; a league betw&eacute;ene their nations. For
which cause, he would bestow his onelie daughter Marie vpon Iames the king of Scotland;
by which mariage, the Scots should not be subiect to the gouernement of England; but contrarie, the English vnder the rule of the Scots. For by that means, besides the quenching
of great hatred betweene the nations (and intercourse of merchandize, exchange of mutuall
courtesies and ioinings in affinitie) there should be an indissoluble knot made for the honor
of the whole Iland.</p>
<p>And with this, they (for England) remembred the profit and disaduantage that might rise
to the one from other, by the friendship or hatred of either kingdome, and the benefit that
they might looke for from their English neighbours, more than by anie possibilitie they might
obteine from their French confederats. For on the one side, the English and they were borne
in one continent, brought vp vnder the same influence of the heauen, and so like in all things,
in toong, in maners, in lawes, in decr&eacute;es, in countenance, in color, and in lineaments of bodie, as that they rather s&eacute;eme one than two nations. On the other side, the French are not
onelie different from them, by naturall soile and clemencie of the heauens; but more seuered
from them in order and forme of liuing, being further such a people, as if they were enimies
vnto them, they could not greatlie hurt them; and if they be their friends they can not greatlie helpe them. But the English are at hand with men, munition, and monie; when the
French, being so far off, are onelie with allurements, inforcements, and for their owne commoditie drawen to take their part. Besides which, there can be no succor from France but
by sea, which the enimie may easilie stop; and so the Scots not able to be succored by them.
But from the English they may haue aid by land with speed, and no man can hinder them
thereof. Wherefore they should consider how discommodious (for the dispatch of their
affairs) and how vnapt (for the defense of themselues) it should be, to hang all the hope
of their succor vpon the fauor of the wind, and to place the most suertie of their estate
in the vnconstant friendship of the vncerteine elements. For (if neuer before) yet at this time
the Scots might not onlie perceiue in thought but feele in d&eacute;ed what helpe is to be hoped
(in present dangers) from absent friends, when that the English can not onelie helpe you
now, but at this instant doo also k&eacute;epe away your promised and long expected aid, which
they haue so besieged vpon the sea, that you can receiue no benefit or helpe from them.</p>
<p>After that these things were thus laid abroad for the knitting of the English league, as
there were not a few which gaue consent to that motion, so were there manie that stiflie argued to the contrarie. For in that assemblie, there were manie pensioners of the French
faction, who (increasing their priuat commoditie by the publike detriment) did vtterlie abhor from all peace; besides whome, there were also some, which suspected the facilitie of
promise in the English: especiallie, since the whole estate of England did then chiefelie hang
vpon the backe of Thomas Woolseie the cardinall, an euill and ambitious person, and who referred all counsels and consultations to the amplifieng of his owne priuat authoritie and dignitie; and for that cause, applied that and all other things to euerie blast of fortune. All
our men although they were mooued by diuerse reasons (as the varietie of diuerse wits bred
diuerse minds) did yet with like indeuor tend vnto one end, which was alwaies to defend the
French league; for they denied, that the same sudden liberalitie of the enimie, could anie
way sort to their benefit; since this was not the first time that the English had vsed that policie to intrap vnwarie men: as did Edward the first, who (swearing and binding himselfe with
all bonds of law, when he was chosen an arbitrator to cease the strife of the kingdome of Scotland) did with great iniurie make a king of Scots at his pleasure: and of late also, Edward
the fourth king of England (when he had promised his daughter Cecilie to the sonne of Iames
the third) did (the maid being <unclear></unclear>adie for the mariage) dissolue the same, by taking occasion
of warre through our ciuill dissentions. According to which, the English doo now also seeke
none other matter, than (casting a vaine hope before vs to gouerne them, to bring vs into
right seruitude; and (when we are destitute of all forren helpe) to oppresse vs with all the
power of their kingdome.</p>

<p>Neither is that true also (wherein the chiefest strength of their sp&eacute;ech consisteth) that the
aid of our neighbors n&eacute;ere at hand, is better or surer to vs than further friendship. For
how may we looke for anie good from those our neighbors, since commonlie amongest
neighbors there neuer want occasions of dissention; which oftentimes chance bringeth foorth,
and the stronger (hauing small or no occasion) will manie times seeke to offer: at what time,
he which is greatest in armes, must &amp; will appoint lawes of agr&eacute;ement as seemes best to his
liking. Beside, there was neuer yet so sacred or firme a bond of amitie betw&eacute;ene adioining
<note place="marg">Where the English haue killed one, the Scots haue murthered ten as the course of their histories will well prooue.</note>
kingdoms, which was not oftentimes broken, either by offered or sought occasions of displeasure
&amp; breach: neither is it to be hoped, that the English will absteine from offering violence
vnto vs; that haue not spared the bloud of so manie of their owne kings. For the sanctitie
of leagues, &amp; the religion of an oth, and the faith of compacts and couenants, are in truth
firme bonds of amitie amongest the good: but amongest the wicked, they are nets to intrap
others, if occasion of commoditie be offered for breach of them. All which benefits and iniuries, doo dwell in people, whome neerenesse of bounds, conuersation of language, and not
vnlike maner of life hath ioined togither.</p>
<p>And if all these things should be far otherwise, yet there be two things which we ought speciallie to fores&eacute;e and prouide for; whereof, the one is, that we spend not our time in vaine by
chiding and disagr&eacute;ement, as persons drawen into diuerse factions; the other, that we reiect not
our old friends (for this new aliance) before we haue heard what they can say; especiallie
in such a cause (as this) which may not be determined, but by the consent of the parlement.
Vpon which, the French followers did earnestlie stand, that there should not anie thing be
doone therein; and therefore sent certeine of the French aid as ambassadors about the cause.
This thus ended, and the comming of the gouernour spread abroad, the same made manie
glad, confirmed the doubtfull thereof, and withdrew others (that were inclined to the English part) from the same opinion they were of.]</p>
<p>The duke immediatlie after his arriuall came to Edenburgh, where he caused all the lords
of the realme to assemble in that towne, where he declared the great loue and affection that
the king of France bare to the realme of Scotland, insomuch as hearing of the slaughters,
murthers and burnings, practised by the Englishmen, he thought that he felt the same
doone vnto him, reputing himselfe one of their members. And for reuenging thereof,
he would b&eacute;e partner with them as their member: for more credit whereof, he shewed
the kings letter, confirming his declaration. He therefore exhorted them to assemble
an armie, in reuenge of iniuries &amp; wrongs doone to them and their countrie; for he
had brought with him monie, men, and artillerie to the furtherance thereof. Herevpon
it was concluded, that the armie should assemble at Dowglas dale the eight&eacute;enth of October: the which conclusion they kept, and from thence they marched to Caldstreame vpon
Tweed, and sent ouer the water certeine of their great artillerie, with a companie of Frenchmen and Scots, by the guiding of Dauid Car; and being got ouer, they lay siege to the

the castell assailed, and part of it beaten downe with the artillerie lieng on the Scotish side

cast downe sundrie piles, and returned without anie resistance: for the earle of Surrie would
suffer none of his people to depart from the armie, nor breake order, for feare of more inconuenience. The duke of Albanie lieng on the Scotish side of Tw&eacute;ed, sent an herald

vnto the earle of Surrie, willing him to call to remembrance, how in his absence he had inuaded Scotland with fire and sword for the which cruell dealing, he required him vpon
his honor to come forward, and he would m&eacute;et him in the confines of both the realmes,
and giue him battell. To the which message the earle answered, that he had no commission to inuade Scotland at that time, but it onlie to defend. And (as some haue reported) he
caused a secret messenger to passe to the qu&eacute;ene, as then lieng a good way distant from the
armie, to mooue for some abstinence and truce, and further to persuade the duke to retire
home; which he did, so that by hir labor, a truce was taken for that instant, and afterward

confirmed for a longer time: and thus the duke returned with honor (as the Scotishmen report.) This truce was well kept all the next winter following, and no inuasion made,
till the moneth of Maie: and then was the erle of Surrie sent againe to the English borders,
and the lords of Scotland on the other part monethlie laie on their borders by quarters, for
defense of their countrie, as the vse is.</p>
<p>On Trinitie sundaie, being the one and twentith of Maie, fiue hundred Scots entered

that went to this faire, and tooke to the number of two hundred prisoners, whom they led
with them into Scotland. But Hall saith, that by the comming of the yoong lord of Fulberie to the succors of the Englishmen, the Scots were chased, and lost two hundred of
their numbers. On the fift of Iulie, sir William Fenwike, Leonard Musgraue, &amp; Bastard

and began to spoile and rob the countrie: but they were shortlie compassed about with

displaied banners, and began to harrie the countrie, and burne diuers places. The Englishmen assembled on euerie side, so that they were farre more in number than the Scotishmen, and therevpon set fiercelie vpon their enimies, insomuch that for the space of an houre,
there was a sore fight continued betwixt them. But the lord Maxwell like a right politike
capteine (as of all that knew him he was no lesse reputed) ceassed not to incourage his people: &amp; after that, by the taking of Alexander Iordein &amp; diuers others, they had bin put backe,
he brought them in araie againe, and beginning a new skirmish, recouered in maner all the
prisoners, tooke and slue diuerse Englishmen, so that he returned with victorie, and led aboue

<p>After this iourneie, there was an assemblie of the lords in Edenburgh, with the duke of

Albanie, where some of the lords were of mind that the warre should continue: other thought

as it had doone by those three last y&eacute;eres wars now passed, and therefore they persuaded
peace. Moreouer, there was also much debating of the matter, touching the age and gouernement of the king; some of the lords holding that he was now of age to take the rule
vpon himselfe, and that the gardianship or tutorie of a king expired sooner than of another

person. The duke of Albanie perceiuing how the lords were diuided amongest themselues,
and neither content with his gouernement, nor willing to mainteine the warres which he
had so earnestle persuaded for the pleasure of France, h&eacute;e declared to them that he wold
returne into France, and so taking his leaue of the nobilitie, went to Striueling where the king
was, of whome he tooke leaue, also giuing vnto him such louing and faithfull counsell, as to
his knowledge s&eacute;emed expedient, and so went into the west countrie, where he tooke the seas

<p>The king of England [before the rumor of the departure of the duke of Albanie] hauing
in the moneth of Iune sent ouer into France, vnto Archembald earle of Angus, that remained
there vpon the commandement of the duke of Albanie, persuaded him to come from thence
secretlie into England, which accordinglie he did; and being safelie arriued in England, king

Henrie procured him to passe into Scotland, that with the assistance of such lords as would
be readie to take his part, he might raise war against the duke of Albanie, which sought by
all meanes (as the king of England was informed) to destroie him &amp; his: but yer the earle
could come into Scotland, the duke was departed toward France. On the six and twentith of
Iulie, the king by the aduise of his mother, and certeine yoong lords, came from Striueling vnto
Edenburgh; and thr&eacute;e daies after, the qu&eacute;ene tooke the whole gouernment of the king vpon

hir, and entered into the castell of Edenburgh with the king, where they soiourned the most
part of the next winter. The prouost of Edenburgh was discharged, whom the towne had
chosen, and the lord Maxwell was appointed by the queene, prouost in his place. For the
performance wherof, there was a parlement also summoned to be holden at Edenburgh the

Buchanan li. 14.) were cast into prison, who after gathering armes (and curssing all others)
within the space of a moneth following were reconciled to the king.]</p>
<p>The king of England glad to heare that the duke of Albanie was departed into France,
sent into Scotland in ambassage one maister Iohn Magnus, and Roger Ratcliffe esquier, to
declare vnto the qu&eacute;ene and lords, that he would be content that a truce might be accorded betwixt the two realmes of England and Scotland, now that the duke of Albanie was
returned into France, who had beene the onlie procurer of the warres. Herevpon they agr&eacute;ed
to take truce to indure for one y&eacute;ere, and in the meane time they appointed to send 
<note place="marg">A truce taken for one yeare.</note>
ambassadors into England to treat vpon a continuall peace, aliance, and amitie to be had betwixt
both the realmes. In this meane while, the earle of Angus came into Scotland: and bicause
of the displeasure which the qu&eacute;ene bare him, there insued occasions of great diuisions within the realme. Notwithstanding the qu&eacute;ene by aduise of certeine lords, sent the lord Gilbert earle of Cassels, Robert Cockeborne bishop of Dunkeld, and doctor Mille abbat of
<note place="marg">Ambassadors into England.</note>
Cambuskenneth, ambassadors into England, in the moneth of December; the which were
receiued at Gr&eacute;enewich by the king of England the foure and twentith of the same moneth:
where the bishop of Dunkeld made an eloquent oration in Latine, declaring the cause of
their comming, the which in effect was for intreatment of peace, loue, and amitie betwixt the
two realmes: and for the more sure establishment thereof, they required that a mariage might
be concluded betwixt their king &amp; the ladie Marie, daughter to the king of England.</p>
<p>This request was well heard by the king, who therevpon appointed commissioners to
common thereof with the said ambassadors. Diuerse articles were proponed by the said commissioners on the king of England his behalfe, and in especiall one; which was, that the
king of Scotland should renounce the league with the king of France; and that further he
should come into England, and remaine there till he came to perfect age to be maried. Bicause the ambassadors had not commission to conclude so farre, the earle of Cassels returned
into Scotland, to vnderstand the minds of the lords and councell in these points, the other remaining at London till his returne to them againe. *Vpon All saints day there was a great

motion of wind, with such stormes and tempests of thunder and lightning which suddenlie
arose, that the same (ouerthrowing manie priuat houses in Edenburgh, and the pinacle of the
tower of Dauid in the same castell) entered into the qu&eacute;enes lodging with a great flame,

which burnt so vehementlie, and went so farre, that it had almost consumed the same:
which storme (ouerthrowing the buildings about the chamber of the bishop of Whitchurch)
the bishops lodging did yet remaine safe not touched with the violence of the flame.)</p>
<note place="marg">Candida Casa.</note>
<p>When the day of the parlement appointed to be holden in the Tolbuith of Edenburgh
was come, the king, queene, and lords, fearing some tumult in the towne to be raised by
the earle of Angus, would not passe foorth of the castell, but kept the parlement within
the same. Archembald Dowglasse earle of Angus, and Iohn Steward earle of Lennox,
with diuerse others, to the number of two thousand men, came in the night season vnto
Edenburgh, bicause they durst not enter the towne in the day time, for feare of the gunnes
that laie in the castell. The next day, being the fourt&eacute;enth day of Februarie, the said earles
with the archbishop of saint Andrews, the bishop of Aberden, that by the qu&eacute;enes appointment had b&eacute;ene kept before in ward, the bishop of Dublane, Calene Campbell, the earle of
Argile, and diuerse other lords and barons being in the towne, sent to the castell, alledging
that the king was kept as prisoner by the queene, and iustice suppressed, with great damage
of the common wealth; and therefore he desired, that the king might be deliuered vnto
<note place="marg">The earle of Angus his request.</note>
them, to be gouerned by the aduise of the thr&eacute;e states, and if they refused to deliuer him,
they would besiege the castell, and if they wan it, all their liues within should rest at their
pleasures, the kings onelie excepted.</p>
<p>The qu&eacute;ene, by the counsell of the earles of Arrane and Murrey, refused not onelie to
deliuer the king, but sent them word, that except they did depart the towne, they would
suerlie discharge all the artillerie of the castell against them. H&eacute;erevpon, great feare rose
in the towne, speciallie among the burgesses, but by the diligence of certeine persons that
trauelled betw&eacute;ene the parties, an assurance was taken on either side for certeine daies.
In the meane time, the earle of Angus caused the castell to be forset, that neither meat nor
<note place="marg">He foresetteth the castell of Edenburgh.</note>

<note place="marg">The parties are agr&eacute;ed.</note>
other thing might be suffered to be conueied into it, except so much as might serue for
the sustentation of the kings owne person. At length, all the parties were agr&eacute;ed, so that
the foure and twentith day of Februarie, the king came vnto the parlement holden in the
Tolbuith in most honorable wise, with the assistance of all the estates, hauing the crowne,
scepter, and swoord borne before him, and from thence he was brought to the abbeie, where
he remained.</p>
<p>In this parlement, there were eight lords chosen to be of the kings priuie councell,
<note place="marg">Councellors appointed.</note>
the which tooke the gouernement of the king and realme vpon them, as these: the archbishops of saint Andrews and Glascow, the bishops of Aberden and Dublane: the earles of
Angus, Argile, Arrane, and Lennox: the qu&eacute;ene was adioined to them as principall, without
whose aduise nothing should be doone. From this parlement also was the earle of Cassels
sent, with answer to the king of England; who came to London the nint&eacute;enth of March.
But bicause the king had knowledge that the French king was taken at the battell of Pauie,
he would not proc&eacute;ed in the treatie of mariage betwixt the king of Scotland and his daughter,
till he had the emperors aduise, whome he affirmed to be his confederat friend: and so renewing the truce for three y&eacute;ers and six moneths, the ambassadors returned into Scotland
<note place="marg">Truce renewed.</note>
about the beginning of April next insuing, without anie contract of mariage at that time.
The agr&eacute;ement betwixt the queene and lords continued not long, for anon after died the
bishop of Dublane or Dunkeld (as saith Lesleus) whose benefice the earle of Angus 
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 9. <emph>pag.</emph> 417.</note>
obteined of the king for his brother William Dowglas, without the aduise of the queene and
other lords. Wherevpon the qu&eacute;ene departed and went vnto Striueling, leauing the king
with the earle of Angus, who tooke the whole rule and gouernment of the realme and king
vpon him, and made his vncle Archembald Dowglas treasuror of the realme, and bestowed
benefices, offices, and all other things, by the aduise of his brother George Dowglas, and
the earle of Lennox, who assisted him.</p>
<p>In this meane time, the archbishop of saint Andrewes, and the earles of Arrane, Argile,
and Murrey, remaining with the qu&eacute;ene at Striueling, alledged that the king was withholden
from them by the earle of Angus sore against his will: and therefore they sent vnto the

earle, requiring him to deliuer him. But the earle caused the king to giue the answer 
<note place="marg">The king not in his owne power.</note>
himselfe, that he would not come from the erle of Angus, albeit he would gladlie haue beene
out of his hands if he might; as by secret messages sent to sundrie of the lords, and likewise at that time it app&eacute;ered, for he willed them by priuie meanes to assemble an armie, and
to come &amp; fetch him out of their hands that thus deteined him. Herevpon shortlie after,
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene mother in armes.</note>
they raised a power, and comming therewith to Linlithgew, purposing to passe into Edenburgh, that they might get the king out of the earle of Angus his hands: the said earle,
with the earle of Lennox and other his assistants being thereof aduertised, came to the field
with the kings banner displaied, and brought the king with him, although partlie against
his will.</p>
<p>The queene and such lords as were with hir there in the armie, for the reuerence they
bare vnto the kings person, and also fearing the danger that might chance to them if they
buckled togither in a foughten field, they withdrew themselues to Striueling, and from
thence the qu&eacute;ene went into Murrey land with the earle of Murrey, and there remained a
long time after. The earles of Arrane and Argile went into the west countrie, and the
bishop of saint Andrews to Dunfermling: and then the earle of Angus tooke vpon him
more boldlie the gouernment of the king and realme, and sent to the bishop of saint Andrews (who was chancellor) for the great seale, which was deliuered to them that were
<note place="marg">The great seale deliuered.</note>
so sent for it. The nobles of the realme remaining thus at variance, and diuided among
themselues, there was small obedience of lawes &amp; iustice. Diuerse slaughters in sundrie
parts were committed, great thefts &amp; robberies made by the borderers vpon the inland countries. Moreouer, a diuorse this y&eacute;ene, (as some haue said) was sued before the archbishop

of S. Andrews, betwixt the qu&eacute;ene, and the earle of Angus hir husband, and then afterwards she tooke to husband one Henrie Steward, sonne to the lord of Auendale, the which
Henrie was after created by the king lord of Methwen.</p>
<p>On the foure and twentith of Iulie, the king being accompanied with the earle of Angus,
<note place="marg"><date>1526.</date></note>
the lord Hume, the Karres &amp; others, rode vnto Jedburgh, in purpose to haue reformed the
misgouernance of the borderers; but after that they had remained there three daies with
little obedience shewed towards them, they all returned. And vpon the 29 day of Iulie,
at the bridge of Melrosse, the lard of Boclouth, accompanied with a thousand horssemen,
<note place="marg">The lard of Boclough his enterprise, to take the king from the earle of Angus.</note>
began to shew himselfe in sight, whose principall purpose was to haue taken the king from
the earle of Angus and his assistants, being requested and commanded by the king himselfe
so to doo. The earle of Angus incontinentlie sent an herald vnto the lard of Boclough,
to know what his intention was to doo; who answered, that he came to doo the king
honor and seruice, and to shew his friends and power as the vse is of the borderers.</p>
<p>The earle of Angus, with the lord Hume, and the rest, not being content with this answer,
because of the great feud betwixt him and the Humes, and the Kars, sent vnto him a commandement in the kings name to depart, and not to approch n&eacute;ere to the kings presence,
vnder paine of high treason. Whervnto he answered, that he knew the kings mind well
inough &amp; would not spare for this commandement to come to his graces presence. Which
answer receiued from him, incontinentlie the earle of Angus, the lords Fleming and Ilume,
the Kars, the lard of Sesseford, with their friends, alighted on foot; the king remaining on
horsbacke, accompanied with the earle of Lennox, the lord Marwell, George Dowglasse,
and Ninian Creichton, tutor of Sainquhar.</p>
<p>The lard of Boclough lighted also on foot, but because the most part of his men were
of the theeues and outlawes of the borders, commonlie called broken men, vpon their first
comming to ioining with their speares, they fled, leauing the lard of Boclough with a small
number of his owne seruants about him in all the danger: yet they defended themselues
verie manfullie, and slue the lard of Sesseford and diuerse other, on the earle of Angus

<p>All this while, the king was gouerned and holden against his will, by the earle of Angus
and his assisters, although he did not outwardlie shew so in countenance, but dissembled
the matter as well as he might, yet perceiuing two &eacute;nterprises to haue quailed that had
b&eacute;ene attempted for his deliuerance, he thought to assaie the third; and h&eacute;erevpon, procured
the earle of Lennox to assemble an armie, with assistance of the qu&eacute;ene and hir friends,
to helpe to deliuer him from the hands of his enimies. The earle of Lennox did so, and

came with such power as he could raise from the west parts vnto Linlithgo. The earle of
Angus being aduertised, that the earle of Lennox was gathering men, sent to the earle of
Arrane for aid, requiring him to come with such power as he could make, and to m&eacute;et
him at Linlithgo. The earle of Arrane immediatlie h&eacute;erewith gathered a power, and with

the same came to Linlithgo before the earle of Lennox came thither, who shortlie after

messenger, requiring him to turne and saue his enterprise, assuring him, that albeit he was
his sisters sonne, he would not spare him, if he held forward vpon his iournie. The earle
of Lennox h&eacute;erewith answered in a great rage, that he would not staie, till he came to
Edenburgh, or else die for it by the waie. The earle of Arrane therefore not staieng for
the earle of Angus his comming from Edenburgh, issued foorth of Linlithgo at the west
end of the towne, and incountered the earle of Lennox and his companie, where there was
a cruell onset giuen on both sides, but suddenlie the earle of Lennox his companie fled, and

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 14.</note>
noise that was made in that conflict, did send foorth (but all too late) Andrew Wood (his
familiar) to haue succored the Lennox, if by anie meanes he could. After this victorie,
the faction of the Dowglasses (to the end that striking a feare in those that were enuious
against them, they might make them alwaies to be in danger to them) began to mooue
questions and sutes in law, against such as had borne armor against the king : for feare
whereof some bought their peace with monie, some tooke part with the Dowglasses, some
followed the Hamiltons, and some stiflie standing in the matter, were followed and called
into the law. Of which number Gilbert earle of Cassiles (when he was earnestlie pressed
by Iames Hamilton the bastard, to y&eacute;eld himselfe to the part of the Hamiltons) being a
man of great stomach, gaue this answer, that the old league of friendship, which was betw&eacute;ene their grandfathers (in which his grandfather was alwaies the more honorable and
first named) should not make him now so forgetfull of the honor of his familie, that he
would s&eacute;eme to degenerat from his ancestors, and willinglie grant to be vnder defense
(which is the next degr&eacute;e of seruitude) of them, whose head in making an equall league
and couenant was contented with the second place of honor.</p>
<p>Wherefore, when the said Gilbert app&eacute;ered in the law at the day appointed, for the deciding of his cause: Hugh Kennedie his kinsman answered for him, that he was present in
that battell, as sent thither by the king, and not as enimie to the king, and he would (if
need required) bring foorth the kings letters therfore, notwithstanding the Hamiltons
frowning and fretting against his boldnesse: for the king had written as well to Gilbert
(going home) as to manie others, to ioine with Iohn Steward earle of Lennox, who s&eacute;eing
the battell at hand, and that he had not time left to call togither his friends and followers,
did with his present companie (taking his iournie out of the waie) turne to Striueling.
Wherfore (the power of the Hamiltons in that cause somewhat suppressed) Iames Hamilton
<note place="marg">The death of the earle of Cassiles.</note>
the bastard stirred with great hatred against Kennedie, did procure Hugh Campbell shiriffe
of Aire to dispatch him out of the waie, which, he shortlie after did in his returne home.
Afterward this Hugh, to the end he might dissemble his conscience or knowledge of this
euill (the execution wherof he had committed to his fellowes) was remaining at the day
and time of the same murther, with Iohn Areskine, whose sister was the wife of Gilbert
Kennedie.</p>
<p>But she (as soone as she heard of that d&eacute;ed) did with manie bitter woords lay the fault

vnto him, because by that fact the noble house of the Kennedies had almost b&eacute;ene brought
to vtter subuersion, had he not left a yoong sonne behind him. This yoong earle, after the
death of his father, fled to his kinsman Archembald Dowglasse then the kings treasuror, to
whome he committed the defense of himselfe and his familie. This doone, Hugh Campbell
was called into law for the said d&eacute;ed, who being manifestlie conuicted thereof, was banished
into an other place. Neither did the Dowglasses with lesse bitternesse exercise their anger
against Iames Beton, for bringing their power to saint Andrewes, which they spoiled, as
after app&eacute;ereth.)</p>
<p>In the meane time, the earle of Angus bringing the king with him, arriued, and had
come to the battell, but that the king was not willing to come foorth of Edenburgh in that
quarrell (as some haue written) and therefore made excuses, as he did also by the waie,
faining himselfe sicke: but George Dowglas droue and called vpon his horsse verie sharpelie,
and constreined him to ride foorth with faster pase than he would haue doone, giuing him
manie iniurious woords, which he remembred afterwards, and would not forget them.
They went that night to Striueling, and shortlie after passed through Fife, searching for
the qu&eacute;ene, and the bishop of saint Andrewes; and because they were kept secretlie in their
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene sought for.</note>
friends houses, so that they could not be heard of, they spoiled the abbeie of Dunfirmeling,
and the castell of saint Andrewes, taking awaie all the moueables which the archbishop had
within the same.</p>
<p>* In the north parts also, the two families of the Lesl&eacute;es and the Forboises, intangled
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 9. <emph>pag.</emph> 423.</note>
with mutuall hatred, raised great flames of tumults and parts taking: which enimities did
after grow to be the greater, because there were dailie manie slaughters of the nobles &amp;
other people committed in Mar, Garreoth, and Aberden, whilest ech faction labored to
<note place="marg"><date>1526.</date></note>
defend it selfe against the others. For which cause (when the common-wealth was much
deformed thereby, and all iustice seemed almost vtterlie ouerthrowne in those parts) the
earle of Angus and other of the nobilitie (which were of the kings priuie councell) did
not ceasse, vntill they had made vnitie betw&eacute;ene those two families. But in the end (the
heire of the Forboises, &amp; the lord Lenturke, hauing by wait killed the noble baron Meldrume, which fauored the Lesl&eacute;es) those buried contentions began againe to be raised from
the dead; whose enimities being once againe knowne to the nobilitie (and what hurt might
insue thereof to the common state) they attempted all possible means once more to quench
that deadlie flame, and afresh to ioine their minds togither in amitie, with this prouiso, that
the murtherers of Meldrume should (for punishment of their offense) be banished into
France, where the greatest part of them died, after manie miseries and reproches susteined
in their pitifull life. Which last league so sincerelie vnited betw&eacute;ene the Forboises and
the Lesl&eacute;es, was imbraced with such faith ech to other, by renewing thereof with continuall
mariages &amp; other courtesies, that it continueth most firme euen vnto this day.</p>
<p>In which north parts also, the inhabitants (partlie following their naturall disposition, and
<note place="marg"><date>1520.</date></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 9. <emph>pag.</emph> 423, 424, &amp;c.</note>
partlie excited by the example of the former times long suffered so to be vsed) did in like
sort ouerrun and spoile all things, by reason of ouermuch libertie. But of all other sturs
raised in those parts, that was the greatest and most troublesome, which was raised by
the Makintosches. Of which vnrulie people, the one familie was called the Glenchattens,
and the other was surnamed Makintosches after the head of that kindred; in which, the
chiefe was called Lachlane Makintosche a man of great possessions, and of such excellencie
in singularitie of wisedome, that with great commendation he did conteine all his followers
within the limits of their dueties, more than others did. Which constreints (when they
could hardlie beare (as loth to liue in order) hauing so long passed their time licentiouslie)
did withdraw the hearts of manie men from him. Amongest whome was Iames Malcolmeson
his kinsman (who thirsting after the desire to rule) tooke occasion (by the iniurie of the
time) traitorouslie with deceipt to kill this Makintosche; after which (fearing further trouble
to insue towards him) he flieth to the Ile (at the lake Rothmurcosie) as a sanctuarie or
<note place="marg">Rothmurcosie.</note>
defense for him. But the rest of the familie of the Makintosches did pursue him with such

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"eager"</fw>-->

<pb n="505"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"505"</fw>-->

eager minds, that by force taking him in the Ile, they woorthilie killed him, and manie of
his confederats, guiltie of that wickednesse. After which (because the sonne of Makintosche, for his tender yeares, was not sufficient with feare &amp; punishment to bridle the minds
of his fierce subiects) by common consent they chose the bastard brother of the slaine man
(called Hector Makintosche) to be head and leader of that familie, vntill this yoong
<note place="marg">New tumults in that familie.</note>
nephue might grow to y&eacute;eres, and might w&eacute;eld the gouernement of his owne tribe.</p>
<p>Now when the earle of Murreie perceiued that if the sonne of Makintosche were committed to the rashnesse of a people somewhat fierce and cruell, that he should (on euerie
side) be oppressed with manie troubles, he did most godlie (for the care he liad of him his
nephue being his sisters sonne) prouide, that he should be caried to an other place, to the
Ogiluies, the childs kin on the mothers side, where he should be well instructed and imbued
with the precepts of all learning and vertue. Whereat Hector was greatlie offended, to s&eacute;e
that the child should so subtilie be taken from him. Wherefore (affirming that much of his
authoritie was thereby diminished) he attempted (euerie way he might) to get the child
againe into his possession, that thereby he might salue and recouer his credit and authoritie.
But some there were, which supposed that the great care and labor which he so much emploied (for getting the child into his hands) was to none other intent, but that he might
make him awaie, and prepare a path whereby to lead his owne sonne to the gouernement
of that familie. Which conceipt being d&eacute;eplie grauen in the mind of the earle of Murreie,
caused him to s&eacute;eke the preseruation of the child, that by no means he might fall into the
hands of Hector.</p>
<p>Wherewith Hector being highlie incensed (and determining to spue out his choler, s&eacute;eking reuenge by anie kind of means) he did cause his brother William &amp; other of his
<note place="marg">The familie of Makintosche raise seditions.</note>
kindred, that ioining their force, they might stronglie vex the earle of Murreie, and spoile
his possessions: which they did with so great furie, that ouerthrowing the fort of Dikes,
and besieging the castell of Tornewaie, they executed manie cruelties, slaughters, spoiles,
burnings, and other mischiefes vpon all sorts of people, men, women, and children, and all
such as fauored them. For their hatred not limited against the earle of Murreie, extended
further against the familie of the Ogiluies, amongest whome the child was left in custodie
for educations cause. With which mind this Hector and his complices placing their campe
at the castell of Pettens, which belonged to the lord of Durnens (one of the familie of the
Ogiluies) they did so furiouslie besiege the same, as the people of the same were in the
end forced to y&eacute;eld the fort: which when they had entred, they killed foure and twentie of
the Ogiluies, whom they found therein. Whervpon (their minds being now aduanced with
spoiles and happie successes) they became so proud, as (trusting ouermuch to prosperous
euent in all their actions) they neuer set end to their wicked crueltie, vntill the erle of
Murreie did with force execute iust iudgement vpon them. For when the earle beheld
them immoderatlie reioising, in spoiling his lands, and committing other excessiue euils; he
obteined of the king and his councell, that he might be made the kings deputie and gouernor in that battell, to bridle the rage and boldnesse of those in that order spoiling the
common-wealth.</p>
<p>Wherefore the earle assembling an armie, did with such speedie valure come vpon them
and their countrie, that at the first he tooke almost two hundred of their capteins, and committed them to the gallowes. All whose faith was so true to their capteine, as (when life
<note place="marg">Woonderfull faith of euill men to their capteine.</note>
was seuerallie promised to euerie one man as he was alone lead to the gallowes) there would
not anie one of them confesse where their capteine Hector had hidden himselfe. For euerie
one answered (with bold spirit) that they knew not where he was become; and if so be
they did, that yet they would not (by anie paine or terror of death) be induced to breake
their faith and to betraie their maister. But hanging not being thought a sufficient reuenge
(for such capteins as the earle had taken) there were more gr&eacute;euous punishments laid vpon
William Makintosche (brother to Hector) because in the beginning he nourished those coles
of choler for his brothers cause. For after that this William was hanged, his head was

chopped off and fastned vpon a pole at Dikes, and the other foure parts of his bodie were
sent to the townes of Elgin, Foresse, Inuernesse, and Alderne, there to be set vp publikelie
so the reproch of them, and the example of others.</p>
<p>Now, after all these sturs, Hector (s&eacute;eing his men were thus dispersed and executed, and
that himselfe was excluded from anie other succor) fled to the faithfull helpe of Alexander
Dunbar deane of Murreie, by whose aduise he goeth humblie and secretlie to the king,
beseeching his mercie and fauor to be extended vnto him : for he supposed it better, rather
to craue the doubtfull mercie of his lord, than to make triall of the earle of Murreis certeine reuenge. Wherevpon the king (seeing his humble submission) receiued him into
his fauor; and did with all his heart louinglie after embrace him, because he was valiant
and wise in warre, and in counsell. But God, whose iustice is alwaies shewed in punishing
of wickednesse, would not suffer this filthinesse of crueltie, theft, murther, &amp; spoile (wherewith Hector did wickedlie defile his life) to go vnreuenged with most gr&eacute;euous paine vpon
the said Hector. For in the citie of saint Andrews, sudden death (than which there can
be no greater punishment) was laid vpon him by one lames Spense a priest, who was
himselfe afterwards beheaded.</p>
<p>When the earle of Murreie had shewed such reuenge vpon the fr&eacute;ends of Hector and
their companions; the people of the prouince of Glencatten did from thencefoorth k&eacute;epe
themselues within the limits of their duetie: vntill that the sonne of Lachlane Makintosche
came to mans estate and full age. Which yoong man was in his first yeares imbued with such
learnings and policie of life conformed therevnto, that when he was imploied about the
common-wealth; all the capteins of them (who naturallie speake Irish in the furthest part
of Scotland) did embrace him as a perfect paterne of all vertue, and an excellent woorkemaister to frame a well ordered state. Wherefore certeine (not able to susteine the brightnesse of his vertue) did ioine in counsell with such as were n&eacute;erest of bloud vnto him, and
had before laid violent hands on his father, to take his life away by forceable means.
Whereof we shall more liberallie intreat in an other place.]</p>
<p>This yeare the king by counsell of the earle of Angus, Arrane, and others, went with
eight thousand men vnto Iedburgh, to set some order amongest the borderers, for the
k&eacute;eping of better rule: and so on the eight of Iune, the principals of all the surnames of
the clans on the borders, came to the king, binding themselues, and deliuering pledges for
their good demenors. The seuenteenth of Iulie, there was a great assemblie of the lords at

Holie rood house, at what time, there came a simple fellow (to looke vpon) seruant and
horskeeper sometime to the earle of Lennox, who in the midst of a great companie of people
in the abbeie close, strake sir Iames Hamilton knight verie desperatlie with a short prage
<note place="marg">Sir Iames Hamilton hurt by a desperat person.</note>
or dagger in the bellie thr&eacute;e seuerall stripes vp to the haft, and yet the said sir Iames died
not of those hurts.</p>
<p>The man being taken, by &amp; by confessed the d&eacute;ed without repentance, saieng; "Phy
on the feoble hand quilke wald not doo that thing the heart thought, and was determinat
to doo." And being inquired what he was, and who caused him to doo the same; he
answered that he was a seruant of God, sent by him to doo that d&eacute;ed. And albeit he was
put to great torture and paines dailie by the space of a moneth, yet would he neuer giue
other answer, and so he was hanged, and his head set ouer one of the gates of Edenburgh
towne. About the same time, there came out of Germanie maister Patrike Hamilton, abbat
of Ferne, brothers sonne to the earle of Arrane, who had b&eacute;ene scholer to Martin Luther,
&amp; others there. This man being conuented and examined vpon certeine articles, as of
iustification, predestination, of fr&eacute;e will, and such like, contrarie to the doctrine taught by
the church in that time, because he did affirme, and constantlie defend them, he was

set open, and vpon hir kn&eacute;es besought him of grace for hir husband and his brother, and
would not rest, till she had obteined the same; but yet they were kept in ward within the
castell, till the king afterwards released them. In the yeare following, the king being now
come to the age of seuent&eacute;ene yeares, and of good discretion and wit for his time, would
<note place="marg">The king being seuent&eacute;ene yeares of age, refuseth to be longer vnder gouernement.</note>
not longer remaine vnder the gouernement of the earle of Angus and his companie. Therevpon he assembled diuerse noble men of Striueling, &amp; by their counsell sent an herald vnto
the earle of Angus &amp; his assistans resiant as then in Edenburgh, commanding them on paine
of high treason, that they should depart foorth of that towne, &amp; that none of them should
come within foure miles of the court, wheresoeuer the same chanced to lie.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, the king himselfe with two thousand men, followed the herald: wherevpon
the earle of Angus, both being charged by the herald, and aduertised of the kings comming
toward the towne, departed thence immediatlie. And shortlie after, the same herald was
sent vnto him againe with commandement from the king, that he should remaine prisoner
within ward in the countrie of Murrey, till the kings pleasure were further knowen: which
he would not obeie; wherefore both he and his adherents were summoned to appeare in
parlement to be holden at Edenburgh, in September next following. In this parlement begun at Edenburgh the sixt of September in this yeare 1528, the earle of Angus, with his

<note place="marg">The earle of Angus atteinted by parlement.</note>
brother George Dowglas, his vncle by his father Archembald Dowglas, Alexander Drommond of Carnocke, and diuerse other, were by decr&eacute;e of parlement atteinted, and forfalted
for diuerse offenses, and speciallie, for assembling the kings people to haue assailed the kings
person: and because he had deteined the king against his will with him the space of two
yeares and more, all which time he stood in feare of his life.</p>
<p>In this parlement Henrie Steward the qu&eacute;enes husband was created Iord of Methwen, and

made maister of the ordinance. *Besides which, in place of earle Dowglas was Gawin
Dunbar, the kings schoolemaister made chancellor, a good and a learned man, and one in
whome manie did desire more ciuill policie; and in the place of Archembald Dowglas the
treasuror was admitted Robert Carnicruce, more famous for his monie than his vertue.
In this parlement there was onelie one found, called Iohn Bannatine, who fauoring the
Dowglas, did boldlie there protest, that whatsoeuer was therin doon, ought by no meanes
to be hurtfull to the earle Dowglas; since iust feare of his appearance there, was a iust
cause to force him to be absent from thence. Within a few daies after, a brother of the
earles called William, abbat of the monasterie of Holirood died, partlie by sickenesse, and
partlie by griefe of mind, being wearied with the present state of things; whose place
Robert Carnicruce, a man of base birth, but well monied, did obteine of the king: who had
granted vnto him the auoidance of the next spirituall liuing. At length, the Dowglas cut
of hope of all good successe, burnt the townes of Constandie and Cranstoune, and so fled to
the castell of Tantallon.]</p>
<p>In October following, the king assembled a great companie of men, with artillerie, and
diuerse kinds of munition, to besiege the castell of Tantallon, which the earle of Angus did
<note place="marg">The castell of Tantallon besieged.</note>
hold, who aduertised of the preparation made for the same siege, furnished the castell with
men and all kind of necessaries, and went himselfe into England. When the siege then was
laid about the castell, it was so strong and so well prouided, that it might not be woone for
all that could be doone at that season: in somuch that after Dauid Fauconer, principall

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 14.</note>
gunner of the kings side was slaine, the king caused the siege to be raised; yet at length
(though not till a long time after this) it was deliuered to the king by appointment. *Before the deliuerie whereof, the king d&eacute;epelie sware that he would not leaue one aliue to
succeed in the inheritance and name of the Dowglasses, so long as he liued and was king.</p>
<p>Wherevpon he came to Edenburgh, where (to the end he might distresse them the more)
he determined by the aduise of his councell to send a dailie companie (though no great
number) to Coldingham, which should defend the husbandmen from the spoile. Which
office appointed to Bothwell chiefe of Louthaine, he did vtterlie refuse; either fearing the
power of the Dowglas (wherevnto all the other strength of Scotland did of late not seeme

to be equall) or that he would not (being then yoong) imbrue his hands with the destruction
of so famous a familie. Wherevpon, since the king durst not trust the Hamiltons (as
friends to his enimies, &amp; being offended with them for the death of Iohn Steward earle of
Lennox, nor durst commit the matter to anie of the adioining nobilitie) at length the same
came so about, that Calene Campbell (dwelling on the furthest borders of the kingdome,
being a man of good estimation for his wisedome, and approoued experience in feats of warre,
and for his iustice d&eacute;erelie loued of the people) was sent by the king (with great authoritie) to
the rebels. Whereby the Dowglasses (being forsaken of the Hamiltons and their other
friends) were brought to those extremities, that they were inforced to depart into England to
K. Henrie the eight, who honorablie and liberallie receiued and interteined them. After
this, the king (as is said) getting the castell of Tantillone by composition, did scarse k&eacute;epe
all the couenants of his grant thereof in writing; although he performed this, that Alexander Drumman at the request of Robert Bretton, had licence to returne home into his countrie, a little before which (as it s&eacute;emeth) when Iames Coluille and Robert Carnicruse were
remooued from the court (as persons suspected to fauor the Dowglasses) their offices were
bestowed vpon Robert Bretton, then in great fauor with the king and courtiers, and aduanced
to the gouernement of manie places.)</p>

field on their side against their enimies. In the same moneth on the fift&eacute;enth day, there was
a great assemblie of the lords in Edenburgh, where the king himselfe sate in iudgement.
The lard of Hinderland called Cockburne, and one Adam Scot of Tushlaw, who was named
king of theeues, were accused of theft, and of receiuing and mainteining of th&eacute;eues,

crimes, and his life, lands, and goods, were in the kings hands. He was therefore kept in
ward within Edenburgh castell, and after sent into Murrey land, &amp; lastlie banished the realme
during the kings daies [and remained at Venice.] Also, the lord Maxwell, the lord Hume,
the lards of Balglueth, Fernihurst, Pollort, Iohnson, Marke Kar [with the earle Bothwell]
and other principall men of the borders, were conuict by assise, and put in ward: by reason
whereof, the borderers kept better rule euer after, during the kings reigne. [Few moneths
after, the king commanded the noble men (before imprisoned, and then to be banished) to
be restored to libertie, taking pledges for their allegiance. Of which companie, one Walter
Scot (killing Robert Iohnstone a th&eacute;efe of noted crueltie, therwith to gratifie the king) began deadlie enimitie with that familie, to the great hurt of both those kinreds.]</p>
<p>About this season, a landed man named Iohn Scot, that had trauelled abroad in the world

diligent watch set vpon him to s&eacute;e that he had no sustenance to relieue him withall, and

<p>In the moneth of Iune, the king with an armie went to the borders to set order there
for better rule to be kept, and to punish such as were knowen to be most culpable. And
herevpon he caused fortie and eight of the most notable theeues, with their capteine Iohn

all hanged on growing trees, to the example of other. There was one cruell th&eacute;efe amongst
the rest, which had burned a house with a woman and hir children within it: he was burned
to death. George Armstrong, brother to Iohn, was pardoned, to the end he should appeach
the residue, which he did; so that they were apprehended by the kings commandement, and
punished for their misdooings, according as they had deserued. In August following, manie
<note place="marg">Woonders s&eacute;ene in the firmament.</note>
meruellous sights were seene about Striueling, as candels burning on the tops of hils in the
nights, and in the morning afore sunne rising. Diuerse armed men appeared fighting vpon
the ground, which was taken to be a foretoken of some trouble to insue in those parties. The
fift&eacute;enth day of August, a great number of people being assembled at the market in Campscenneth, fiftie &amp; two persons were drowned in the ferrie bote; amongst the which were

the twentie and seuenth of the same moneth, vpon a publike scaffold in Edenburgh was degraded (the king, qu&eacute;ene, and a great companie of people being present) and after his degradation, he was deliuered to the earle of Argile high iustice, and the next day the said

Tulliallan and the same priest were beheaded. This y&eacute;ere the college court of iustice called the sessions was instituted in Edenburgh by the king, with consent of the three estates in

ordinarie, eight of them being spirituall persons, of the which the most ancient is president,
and seuen temporall men, but so as by this number the chancellor of the realme is aboue the

authoritie to the hermitage (a castell in Liddesdale) to represse the spoiles and robberies
committed there. When of ancient time there had b&eacute;ene no certeine daies and place appointed for the deciding of monie, contentions, or debts amongest the citizens and people
of Scotland, Iohn duke of Albanie obteined from the bishop of Rome, that a yeerelie summe
of monie (as much as should be sufficient to paie the stipend of a few iudges that shuld be
appointed therefore) should be leuied of the cleargie, of euerie one according to his estate
and substance. Whervpon Gawin Dunbar bishop of Aberden for himselfe in the name
of the cleargie, appealed to the said bishop of Rome. Which controuersie continued from
the fift Ides of March, vntill the tenth kalends of Maie, at which day the college of the iudges
of Edenburgh was established, of whom in the beginning there were many profitable things
doone, and law was equallie ministred; but yet the same end did not follow which was
then hoped amongst them. For since in Scotland there be almost no lawes but such as are
decr&eacute;ed by parlement, which are not commonlie perpetuall, but made for a time; and that
the iudges as much as in them lieth doo hinder the making of such lawes: the goods of all
men were committed to the arbitrement of fifteene men, which haue perpetuall power therfore,

also set downe Lesleus words, writing in this order. In this parlement (saith he) by the consent of the states, it s&eacute;emed good that the forme of iudgement vsed by our ancestors should
be taken away. For where certeine of the cleargie, of the barons, and of the citizens, were
chosen euerie yeere to trauell ouer the foure parts of the realme, to giue iudgement of
ciuill causes (as they terme it) and of other things intangled with the controuersie of law:
and that then it oftentimes happened, either by the ignorance of the iudge that did not atteine
to the perfection of the law, or by the malice of them which were corrupted with bribes, that
the woorser part had vniustlie the vpper hand against the righter; to which discommoditic
this was also ioined, that no cause could be well examined to the vttermost by one man at
one time, bicause the iudges were so often changed; whereey it must n&eacute;eds folow, that seuerall iudges (hauing seuerall minds and wits) must for one matter giue inconstant &amp; contrarie iudgements. Wherefore to take awaie this varietie of iudgements and other discommodities, wherewith the common-wealth was afficted; it pleased the parlement by the persuasion of the king, that a certeine defined number of senators (being persons of the greatest
knowledge in law) should haue a permanent place at Edenburgh, to decide all matters of controuersie, the maner &amp; order whereof we haue set downe in our former booke, saith Lesleus. And I for my part thinke not vnm&eacute;et for the more explaning thereof, to set it downe
in this place out of the same Lesleus.</p>
<p>The companie (saith he) of these men (whom wee call the senat of the publike wealth)

receiue none but such, whose praise of vertue and sharpenesse of wit (especiallie in matters
of law) dooth aduance them to that place. This court is so apted of the clergie and secular
nobilitie (as a man may tearme them) that the one part of the laitie dooth answer the other
number of the cleargie. Which we thinke to b&eacute;e doone by the great benefit of God, that the
religion and simplicitie of the cleargie may temper the singular wisedome of the temporaltie,
obteined by the experience of worldlie causes; and againe, the iudgement of the laitie may
further and moderate the pure religion and ancient simplicitie of the cleargie. Ouer all
these is one chiefe and head (which is a spirituall man) who hath the highest place in sentence and pronouncing of iudgement; except the iudgement of the chancellor of the kingdome happen to come in place; for then therevnto the Scots giue the chiefest preheminence
in all the affaires of the common-wealth. Thus much he.)</p>

were diuerse inuasions made on euerie side vpon the borders, and ships likewise taken by sea,
and yet no warre was proclamed. In September, in the yeere 1533, certeine commissioners
of either realme were at Newcastell, to intreat for a redresse and recompense to be made for
burning of townes and villages, taking of goods, casting downe of piles, taking of ships,
slaughters of men, and diuerse other spoiles and iniuries doone, as well by the sea as by the
land, from the 23 day of Aprill in the y&eacute;ere 1532, vnto the day of the m&eacute;eting of the same
commissioners; which dooings were little lesse in effect than had b&eacute;ene vsed in time of
open warre, although the same was not proclamed. Bicause therefore that the scathes &amp; iniuries fell out to be so great on both sides, that particular redresse could not b&eacute;e had, the
order thereof was referred to the pleasure of both the princes.</p>

Lauret beside Muskelburgh, and afterward sent for diuerse of his lords, and by their counsell tooke his voiage againe by sea with fiue ships, to passe into France, as he was minded to
haue doone the first time: but what caused him to alter his purpose then, we find not. This
second time he imbarked at Kirckaldie the last of August, and with good and prosperous wind

Picardie, taking with him but one seruant named Iohn Tennent, whome he caused to take vpon
him as he had beene maister; and so comming to the duke of Vandosme his place, got sight
of the ladie who shuld haue b&eacute;ene his wife; but not liking hir, he returned againe without
talking either with hir or hir friends: and comming to Rouen where his companie were abiding for him, he passed from thence towards Paris, where the Dolphin of France was appointed by the king his father to m&eacute;et him seuen leagues from the citie, who brought him to the

other exercises of warlike feates, he shewed himselfe as hardie, cunning and valiant, as anie
other person within all the realme of France, for the which he wan passing great praise.</p>

fauoured aboue all other within his realme. The French king was glad h&eacute;ereof, that the
ancient band betwixt Scotland and France might thus with new aliance be confirmed, and
therefore declared that he would willinglie giue him his daughter in mariage. But h&eacute;erewith he let him vnderstand, that his daughter was much subiect to sicknesse, and therfore
he referred that vnto the king of Scotland his owne pleasure, whether he would haue hir, or
his yoongest daughter the ladie Margaret, who was after maried to the duke of Sauoy. This
offer of choise being reported to the king of Scotland, he continued in his former purpose,
which was, to match with the ladie Magdalen, who was in d&eacute;ed a plesant yoong ladie, beautifull, of good fauour, louelie countenance, and comelie manners, aboue all others within that
realme.</p>

his wife, farre aboue the summe of an other hundred thousand crownes, with two great ships
(the one called the salamander) and great plentie of artillerie, powder, and other munition.

remained in France, till the moneth of Maie, passing the time with all kind of pleasure and
disport that might be deuised for his honorable interteinment. Finallie, the king and his wife
qu&eacute;ene Magdalen tooke their leaue of the king of France their father at Paris, about the latter
end of Aprill, and so rode to Rouen, where they were receiued with great triumph, and

from thence they passed downe the riuer to Newhauen where they imbarked, being accompanied by the admerall of France, and manie other noble men of the realme, appointed by

to receiue them with passing ioy and gladnesse, &amp; from thence with great triumph they were
conueied to the abbeie of Holie rood house.</p>

contented so highlie the mind and fantasie of the king hir husband, that there was neuer
more hope of wealth and prosperitie to succ&eacute;ed within the realme, than at that present. But
fortune enuieng so great felicitie, would not suffer them to continue anie longer time togither:

was also conuict for misprision and concealement of that crime, and therfore forfaiting all his
lands, was condemned to die: but because he was yoong and of tender yeeres, the king pardoned him of life, and commanded him to perpetuall prison, in the which he remained so

Huntleie, for the like conspiracie of the kings death, for the which he was beheaded and quartered, and his head and quarters set aloft vpon the gates of Edenburgh. His father the lord

widow, daughter to the duke of Guise. And being aduertised from his said ambassadors,
that the king of France, the ladie hir selfe, and hir friends, were well contented therewith,

his departure, he had prouided successors to all his benefices, first to his archbishops s&eacute;e,
and to the abbeie of Arbroth, maister Dauid Beton, afterwards cardinall; and to the abbeie
of Dunfermeling maister George Durie that was archdeacon of saint Andrews. These
men, without anie gainesaieng of the king, entered with his good will into the same benefices, immediatlie after his deceasse. This Iames Beton builded a great part of the new

good seruice he had doone to the king, speciallie in reparing the palaces of Striueling and
Linletgew; as also for that the king had him in so high fauor, that he stood in no feare of

neuer in anie lot offended the kings maiestie, and that this death was yet woorthilie inflicted

was but onelie six houres betwixt the time of their departures out of this world; which
caused no lesse lamentation through the whole realme, than there was ioy at their births.
After this, the queene went vnto saint Iohns towne, where she was honorablie receiued with
great triumph made by the towne. She was accompanied with the principall men of the

by the towne and vniuersitie they were receiued with great ioy, triumph, pageants, verses,
&amp; plaies, set foorth in the best maner for their pastime. They remained there the space of
fift&eacute;ene daies, and were highlie interteined by the bishop of that place.</p>
<p>There were exercises and disputations held in all kind of sciences in the colleges and
schooles, with diuerse orations made in Greeke, Latine, and other languages, to the high
praise and commendation of the maisters &amp; students in that vniuersitie. From thence the
king with the queene returned to Dund&eacute;e, where a costlie entrie was prepared for them
also, and after they had b&eacute;ene right princelie interteined there, they came to Falkeland.

was conuicted and declared an heretike. An image was made to resemble him, and at the

states of Ireland did call himselfe king of Ireland, when all his predecessors before were
onelie intituled by the names of lords of Ireland. For by that new title, king Iames his
authoritie did s&eacute;eme to be diminished, when the king of England did write himselfe king
of all Ireland: whereof a portion by manie ages was vnder the rule of the king of Scots. Yet
<note place="marg">A small portion in d&eacute;ed.</note>
at length K. Iames did y&eacute;eld therevnto; and that the rather, because the king of England
vnder this title and authoritie, did not dispossesse the heires of the Scot Makeconell; and
other his Scots of those lands which they there inioied in that countrie.]</p>
<p>This yeare the king of England aduertised of the meeting of the emperor, the French

king, and pope, at the citie of Nice, doubting some practise to be deuised there against

him, sent to the king of Scotland the bishop of saint Dauids, &amp; the lord William Howard,
desiring him as his most tender kinsman and nephue, to m&eacute;ete him at the citie of Yorke in
England, where he would communicat such things with him, as should be for the weale
of both the realmes. And therewith the king of England, trusting that the king of Scotland
would haue fulfilled his desire, caused great preparation to be made at Yorke for the receiuing of him. But albeit the king of Scotland was willing of himselfe to haue passed
into England, to haue met and seene his vncle; yet after long reasoning and deliberation
of his councell and prelats [especiallie Iames Beton bishop of saint Andrews, and George
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
Crichtoune bishop of Aberden (as saith Buchanan. lib. 14.] assembled for that purpose,
casting in their minds (as they tooke it) what danger might fall to him and his realme, if
he should passe into England, in case he should be staied and holden there, contrarie to his
will, as king Iames his predecessor was, hauing no succession of his bodie.</p>
<p>And againe, for that it was certeinelie knowen, that the principall cause, why the king of
England required this meeting or interuiew, was to persuade the king of Scotland to vse the
like order in Scotland, as he had doone within his realme of England, in abolishing the
popes authoritie, making himselfe supreame head of the church, expelling religious persons
out of their houses, and seizing the iewels of their houses, their lands and rents, and such
like information. And if it chanced the king should attempt the like, they should lose the
friendship which was betwixt him, the pope, the emperor, and French king, that were his

great friends and confederats. Herevpon they persuaded him to staie, and by their aduise
sent pleasant letters &amp; messages vnto the said king of England, desiring him to haue him
excused, for that he could not come into England at that time, hauing such lets and causes
of abiding at home, as shortlie he should vnderstand by his ambassadors, whom he ment
to send to him, as well for this matter as other causes. And shortlie after sir Iames 
<note place="marg">Sir Iames Leirmouth ambassador into England.</note>
Leirmouth was appointed to go as ambassador into England, as well to make the kings excuse
for his not comming to m&eacute;et the king of England at Yorke; as also to make complaint
vpon certeine inuasions made by the borderers of England into Scotland, and also for the
vsing of the debatable ground betwixt the two realmes.</p>
<p>But the king of England sore offended that the king of Scots would not satisfie his

<note place="marg">The king of England meaneth to make warre into Scotland.</note>
request, to meet him at Yorke (as before is recited,) would admit no excuse, but determined
to make warre into Scotland, albeit as the Scotishmen allege, he would not suffer the same
to be vnderstood, till he had prepared all things in a redinesse. In the meane time he sent
commissioners to m&eacute;et with the Scots commissioners vpon the debatable ground, to talke
for redresse to be made of harmes doone vpon the borders, but no good conclusion could
be agr&eacute;ed vpon by these commissioners, neither touching the debatable land, nor yet for reparing of wrongs doone by the inuasions. &para; But that the truth concerning the causes of
this war, moued at this present by that noble prince king Henrie the eight, may the better
appeare; I haue thought good here to set downe the same, as they were drawen foorth

haue thought good to notifie vnto the world his doings and behauiour in the prouocation
of this war, &amp; likewise the meanes &amp; waies by vs to eschew &amp; auoid it, &amp; the iust &amp; true
occasions wherby we be now prouoked to prosecute the same, and by vtterance and divulging
of that matter, to disburden some part of our inward displeasure and griefe: and the circumstances knowen, to lament openlie with the world the infidelitie of this time, in which
things of such enormitie doo burst out and appeare.</p>
<p>"The king of Scots our nephue &amp; neighbor, whome we in his youth and tender age preserued and mainteined from the great danger of others, and by our authoritie and power conducted him safelie to the roiall possession of his estate, he now compelieth &amp; inforceth vs (for
preseruation of our honor &amp; right) to vse our puissance &amp; power against him. The like
vnkindnesse hath beene heretofore shewed by other in semblable cases against Gods law,
mans law, &amp; all humanitie; but the oftener it chanceth, the more it is to be abhorred, and
yet in the persons of princes, for the raritie of them, can so happen but seldome as it hath
now come to passe. It hath b&eacute;ene verie rarelie &amp; seldome s&eacute;ene rofore, that a king of Scots
hath had in mariage a daughter of England. We cannot nor will not reprehend the king
our fathers act therein, but lament and be sorie that it tooke no better effect.</p>
<p>"The king our father in that matter minded loue, amitie, and perpetuall friendship betw&eacute;ene the posteritie of both: which how soone it failed, the death of the king of Scots,
as a due punishment of God, for his vniust inuasion into this our realme, is and shall be a
perpetuall testimonie of their reproch for euer. And yet in that present time could not the
vnkindnesse of the father extinguish in vs the naturall loue of our nephue his sonne, being
then in the miserable age of tender youth. But we then forgetting the displeasure that

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"should"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"518"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

should haue woorthilie prouoked vs to inuade that realme, nourished and brought vp our
nephue, to atchiue his fathers possession and gouernement, wherein he now so vnkindlie
vseth and behaueth himselfe towards vs, as he compelleth vs to take armor and warre
against him.</p>
<p>"It is speciallie to be noted, vpon what grounds, and by what means we be compelled
to this warre, wherin among other is our chiefe greefe and displeasure, that vnder a colour
of faire speach and flattering words, we be ind&eacute;ed so iniuried, contemned and despised,
as we ought not with sufferance to permit and passe ouer. Words, writings, letters,
messages, ambassages, excuses, allegations, could not more pleasantlie, more gentlie, nor
more reuerentlie be deuised and sent, than hath b&eacute;ene made on the king of Scots behalfe
vnto vs: and euer we trusted the tr&eacute;e would bring foorth good fruit, that was of the one
part of so good a stocke, and continuallie in appearance put foorth so faire buds: and
therefore would hardlie bel&eacute;eue or giue eare to other, that euer alledged the deeds of the
contrarie, being neuerthelesse the same d&eacute;eds so manifest, as we must n&eacute;eds haue regarded
them, had not we bin so loth to thinke euill of our nephue, whome we had so manie
waies bound to be of the best sort toward vs.</p>
<p>"And therefore hauing a message sent vnto vs the y&eacute;ere past, from our said nephue,
and a promise made for the repairing of the said king of Scots vnto vs to Yorke, and after
great preparation on our part made therefore, the same m&eacute;eting was not onelie disappointed,
but also at our being at Yorke in the lieu thereof, an inuasion made by our said nephue his
subiects into our land, declaring an euident contempt and despite of vs. We were yet glad
to impute the default of the m&eacute;eting to the aduise of his councell, and the inuasion to the
lewdnesse of his subiects, and according therevnto gaue as benigne and gentle audience to
such ambassadors as repaired hither at Christmas afterward, as if no such cause of displeasure
had occurred, speciallie considering the good words, sweet words, pleasant words, eftsoones
proponed by the said ambassadors, not onelie to excuse that was past, but also to persuade
kindnesse and perfect amitie to insue.</p>
<p>"And albeit the king of Scots hauing (contrarie to the article of the league of amitie)
receiued and interteined such rebels as were of the ch&eacute;efe and principall, in stirring the insurrection in the north against vs, with refusall before time, vpon request made to restore
the same; yet neuerthelesse, vpon offer made, the said ambassadors to send commission to
the borderers, to determine debates of the confines in the same, with so great a pretense of
amitie, and so faire words as could be in sp&eacute;ech desired, we were content for the time to
forbeare to presse them ouer extreamlie in the matter of rebels. Alleit we neuer remitted
the same, but desiring to make triall of our said nephue in some correspondence of d&eacute;eds,
condescended to the sending of commissioners to the borders, which to our great charge
we did, and the king of Scots our said nephue the semblable.</p>
<p>"Where after great trauell made by our commissioners, this fruit insued, that being for
our part chalenged, a p&eacute;ece of our ground plainlie vsurped by the Scots, and of no great
value, being also for the same shewed such euidence, as more substantiall, more autentike,
plaine and euident, cannot be brought forth for anie part of ground within our realme: the
same was neuerthelesse by them denied, refused, and the euidence onelie for this cause
reiected, that it was made (as they alledged) by Englishmen: and yet it was so ancient, as
it could not be counterfeit now, and the value of the ground so little, and of so small
weight, as no man would haue attempted to falsifie for such a matter. And yet this deniall
being in this wise made vnto our commissioners, they neuerthelesse by our commandement
departed as friends from the commissioners of Scotland, taking order as hath b&eacute;ene accustomed, for good rule vpon the borders in the meane time.</p>
<p>"After which their recesse, the lord Maxwell warden of the west marches of Scotland,
made proclamation for good rule; but yet added therwith, that the borderers of Scotland
should withdraw their goods from the borderers of England; and incontinent the Scotishmen
borderers, the fourth of Iulie entered into our realme suddenlie, and spoiled our subiects

contrarie to our leagues, euen after such extremitie as it had b&eacute;ene in the time of open
warre, whereat we much maruelled, and were compelled therefore to furnish our borders
with a garrison for defense of the same. Wherevpon the king of Scots sent vnto vs Iames
Leirmouth maister of his houshold, with letters deuised in the most pleasant maner, offering
redresse &amp; reformation of all attempts. And yet neuerthelesse, at the entrie of the said
Leirmouth into England, a great number of the Scots then not looked for, made a forraie
into our borders, to the great annoiance of our subiects, &amp; to their extreame detriment.
Wherewith, and with that vnseemelie dissimulation, we were not a little mooued, as reason
would we should; and yet did we not finallie so extreamelie prosecute and continue our
said displeasure, but that we gaue benigne audience to the said Leirmouth, and suffered
our selfe to be somewhat altered by his words and faire promises, tending to the persuasion
that we euer desired, to find the king of Scots such a nephue vnto vs, as our proximitie of
bloud (with our gratuitie vnto him) did require.</p>
<p>"In the meane time of these faire words, the d&eacute;eds of the borderers were as extreame at
might be, and our subiects spoiled: and in a rode made by sir Robert Bowes for a reuenge
thereof, the same sir Robert Bowes, with manie other were taken prisoners, and yet deteined in Scotland without putting them to fine or ransome, as hath b&eacute;ene euer accustomed.
And being at the same time a sursesance made on both sides, at the sute of the said Leirmouth for a season; the Scots ceassed not to make sundrie inuasions into our realme, in
such wise as we were compelled to forget faire words, and onelie to consider the king of Scots
d&eacute;eds, which appeared vnto vs of that sort, as they ought not for our dutie in defense of
our subiects, ne could not in respect of our honor, be passed ouer vnreformed: and therefore
put in a readinesse our armie, as a due meane whereby we might atteine such a peace, as for
the safegard of our subiects we be bound to procure.</p>
<p>"After which preparation made, and knowledge had thereof, the king of Scots ceassed
not to vse his accustomed meane of faire words, which in our naturall inclimation wrought
eftsoones their accustomed effect, euermore desirous to find in the king of Scots such regard
&amp; respect to be declared in d&eacute;eds, as the correspondence of naturall loue in the nephue to
such an vncle, as we haue shewed our selfe toward him, dooth require. Wherefore vpon
new request and sute made vnto vs, we determined to staie our armie at Yorke, appointing
the duke of Norffolke our lieutenant, the Lord priuie seale, the bishop of Durham, and the
maister of our horsses, there to commen, treat, and conclude with the ambassadors of Scotland, for an amitie and peace, vpon such conditions, as by reason and equitie were indifferent, whereby the warre might be eschewed, being by sundrie inuasions of the Scots then
opened &amp; manifest.</p>
<p>"In this communnication betw&eacute;ene our and their commissioners, after diuerse degr&eacute;es of
commission shewed by the Scots, and finallie one that was by our commissioners allowed,
matters were proponed for conclusion of amitie, nothing difficill or hard of our part, but so
agr&eacute;eable to reason, as the commissioners of Scotland said they doubted not, but if it might
be brought to passe that the king of Scots our nephue might haue a m&eacute;eting with vs, all
matters should easilie be compounded and determined: wherevpon they left speaking of
anie articles of amitie, and the ambassadors of Scotland made much outward ioy in communication of meeting. They shewed themselues in words, fashion, and behauior much
to delight in it, to reioise in it, and therewith thought it easie and facile to be concluded and
accomplished, and for their part they tooke it then for a thing passed, a thing concluded,
and most certeine to take effect, and onelie desired six daies to obteine answer from their
maister, and our armie, from that time to staie and go no further: wherevnto our commissioners then agr&eacute;ed.</p>
<p>"After these six daies was sent a commission out of Scotland, with power to conclude a
m&eacute;eting preciselie at such a place, as they knew well we should not, nor could not in winter
obserue &amp; k&eacute;epe. Wherewith when our commissioners were miscontent, the ambassadors
of Scotland to relieue that displeasure, and to temper the matter whereby to win more time,

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"shewed"</fw>-->

<pb n="520"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"520"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

shewed foorth their instructions, wherein libertie was giuen to the ambassadours to exceed
their commission in the appointment of the place, and to consent to anie other that by our
commissioners should be thought conuenient. Which maner of proc&eacute;eding when our commissioners refused, alledging that they would not conclude a m&eacute;eting with men hauing
no commission therevnto: the ambassadors of Scotland vpon pretense to send for a more
ample and large commission, agr&eacute;eable to their instructions for appointment of the place,
obteined a delaie of other six daies, to send for the ample commission without restraint of
place.</p>
<p>"Now after these six daies they brought foorth a new commission, made in a good forme,
and without exception: but therewith also they shewed new instructions, conteining such a
restraint as the former commission did conteine, so as the libertie giuen to the commissioners
in the commission was now at the last remooued and taken awaie by the instructions, with
addition of a speciall charge to the ambassadors, not to exc&eacute;ed the same. And thus, first
the ambassadors of Scotland seemed to haue a will and desire to conclude on a place
seemelie and conuenient, which for want of commission they might not doo, and at the last
might haue concluded a m&eacute;eting by vertue of their commission; and then for feare of the
commandement in their second instructions they durst not. And so they shewed their first
instructions partlie to excuse their king, who should s&eacute;eme secretlie to will more than in
the commission he did openlie professe.</p>
<p>"Then with an ample commission from the king, they shewed their secret instructions
for defense of themselues, why they proc&eacute;eded not according to their commission, not caring
how much they charged therein the king, whose fault they disclosed to discharge themselues,
trusting that by the benefit of the winter approching, and the time lost in their communication, their maister should be defended against our power for this y&eacute;ere, without dooing
for their part that by honor, right, law, and leagues they be obliged and bound to doo.
And in this meane time our subiects being taken prisoners in Scotland, could not be deliuered vpon any ransome, contrarie to all custome and vsage of the borderars in the time
of peace and warre: and in this meane time staied a great part of our armie alreadie prested,
and in our wages to go forward.</p>
<p>"In this time ambassadors (as ye haue heard) assembled to talke of an amitie, but concluded none. The treating of amitie was put ouer by communication of a meeting. The
communication of m&eacute;eting was so handled by aheration of commission and instructions on
their behalfe, as it appeareth a plaine deuise onelie inuented for a delaie, which hath giuen
vs light, wherevpon more cerreinly to iudge the king of Scots inward affection toward vs:
whose deeds and words well weied and considered, doo vs plainlie to vnderstand, how he
hath continuallie labored to abuse vs with sweet and pleasant words, and to satisfie the
appetites of other at home and abroad with his vnkind and displeasant d&eacute;eds. In his words
he professeth an indissoluble amitie, he allegeth kinred, he acknowledgeth benefits, onlie the
fault is, that he speaketh another language to all the world in deeds, and thereby so toucheth
vs in honor and denegation of iustice, as we be inforced and compelled to vse the sword,
which God hath put in our hands as an extreme remedie, whereby to obteine both quietnesse for our subiects, and also that is due to vs by right, pacts, and leagues.</p>
<p>"We haue patientlie suffered manie delusions, and notablie the last y&eacute;ere, when we made
preparation at Yorke for his repaire to vs. But should we suffer our people and subiects to
be so oft spoiled without remedie? This is doone by the Scots, whatsoeuer their words be.
Should we suffer our rebels to be deteined contrarie to the leagues without remedie? This
is also doone by them, whatsoeuer their words be. Should we suffer our land to be vsurped
contrarie to our most plaine euidence, onelie vpon a will, pride and arrogancie of the other
partie? This is doone by them whatsoeuer their words be. All these be ouer presumptuouslie doone against vs, and giue such signification of their arrogancie, as it is necessarie
for vs to oppresse it in the beginning, least they should gather further courage, to the
greater displeasure of vs and our posteritie hereafter. And yet in the intreating of this

matter, if we had not euidentlie perceiued the lacke of such affection as proximitie of bloud
should require; we would rather haue remitted these iniuries in respect of proximitie of
bloud, to our nephue, than we did tofore his fathers inuasion.</p>
<p>"But weieng that we be so suerlie ascerteined of the lacke thereof, and that our bloud
is there frozen with the cold aire of Scotland, there was neuer prince more violentlie compelled to war, than we be by the vnkind dealing, vniust behauior, &amp; vnprincelie demeanor
of him, that yet in nature is our nephue, &amp; in his acts and d&eacute;eds declareth himselfe not to
be mooued therwith, nor to haue such earnest regard to the obseruation of his pacts &amp;
leagues, nor such respect to the interteinment of the administration of iustice, as naturall
equitie bindeth, &amp; conseruation of equitie requireth. Which we much lament &amp; be sorie
for, &amp; vse now our force and puissance against him, not for reuengement of our priuate displeasure (being so often deliuered as we haue b&eacute;ene) but for recouerie of our right, the
preseruation of our subiects from iniuries, and the obseruation of such leagues as haue
passed betweene vs, firmelie trusting, that almightie God, vnder whome we reigne, will assist
&amp; aid our iust proceedings herein, to the furtherance and aduancement of the right, which
we doubt not shall euer preuaile against wrong, falshood, deceipt, and dissimulation.</p>
<p>"Hitherto appeareth how this present warre hath not proceeded of anie demand of our
right of our superioritie, which the kings of Scots haue alwaies knowledged by homage and
fealtie to our progenitors euen from the beginning: but this warre hath b&eacute;ene prouoked and
occasioned vpon present matter of displeasure, present iniurie, present wrong ministred by
the nephue to the vncle most vnnaturallie, and supported contrarie to the deserts of our
benefits most vnkindlie, if we had minded the possession of Scotland, and by the motion of
warre to atteine the same, there was neuer king of this realme had more opportunitie in the
minoritie of our nephue, nor in anie other realme a prince that hath more iust title, more euident title, more certeine title, to any realme that he can claime, than we haue to Scotland.</p>
<p>"This title is not deuised by pretense of mariage, nor imagined by couenant, nor contriued by inuention of argument, but lineallie descended from the beginning of that estate
established by our progenitors, and recognised successiuelie of the kings of Scotland, by
deeds, words, acts, and writings continuallie almost without interruption, or at the least
intermission, till the reigne of our progenitor king Henrie the sixt, in whose time the Scots
abused the ciuill warre of this realme, to their licence and boldnesse, in omitting of their
dutie: which for the proximitie of bloud betwene vs, we haue b&eacute;ene slacke to require of
them, being also of our selfe inclined to peace, as we haue euer beene alwaies glad, rather
without preiudice to omit to demand our right if it might conserue peace, than by demanding thereof to be s&eacute;ene to mooue warre, speciallie against our neighbour, against our nephue,
against him whome we haue preserued from danger, and in such a time as it were expedient
for all christendome to be in vnitie and peace, whereby to be more able to resist the common enimie the Turke.</p>
<p>"But for what considerations we haue omitted to speake hitherto of the matter, it is
neuerthelesse true, that the kings of Scots haue alwaies acknowledged the kings of England
superior lords of the realme of Scotland, &amp; haue doone homage and fealtie for the same.
This appereth first in histories written by such, as for confirmation of the truth in memorie
haue trulie noted and signified the same. Secondlie, it appeareth by instruments of homage
made by the kings of Scots, and diuerse notable personages of Scotland, at diuerse &amp; sundrie
times sealed with their seales, and remaining in our treasurie. Thirdlie, it appeareth by
registers and records iudiciallie and autenticallie made, yet preserued for confirmation of the
same. So as the matter of title b&eacute;eing most plaine, is furnished also with all maner of
euidences for declaration thereof.</p>
<p>"First, as concerning histories, which be called winesses of times, the light of truth,
and the life of memorie, and finallie the conuenient way &amp; meane whereby the things of
antiquitie may be brought to mens knowledge, they shew as plainlie this matter as could
be wished or required, with such a consent of writers as could not so agree vpon an vntruth,
conteining a declaration of such matter as hath most euident probabilitie and apparance.

For as it is probable and likelie, that for the better administration of iustice amongest rude
people, two or more of one estate might be rulers in one countrie, vnited as this Ile is:
so it is probable and likelie, that in the beginning it was so ordered for auoiding dissention,
that there should be one superiour, in right of whom the said estates should depend.</p>
<p>"According wherevnto we read, how Brute, of whome the realme then called Britaine
tooke first that name (being before that time inhabited with giants, a people without order
or ciuilitie) had thr&eacute;e sonnes, I ocrine, Albanact, and Camber, who determining to haue the
whole Ile within the ocean sea to be after gouerned by them thr&eacute;e, appointed Albanact to
rule that now is called Scotland, Camber the parties of Wales, and Locrine that now is
called England: vnto whom (as being the eldest sonne) the other two brethren should doo
homage, recognising and knowledging him as their superior. Now consider, if Brute conquered all this Hand, as the historie saith he did, and then in his owne time made this order
of superioritie as afore; how can there be a title deuised of a more plaine beginning, a more
iust beginning, a more conuenient beginning, for the order of this Hand, at that time speciallie,
when the people were rude? Which cannot without continuall strife and variance conteine
twoo or thr&eacute;e rulers in all points equall without any maner of superieritie, the inward conscience and remorse of which superioritie should in some part dull and diminish the peruerse
courage of resistance and rebellion.</p>
<p>"The first diuision of this Ile, we find written after this sort, without cause of suspicion
why they should write amisse. And according heerevnto we find also in historie set foorth
dy diuerse, how for transgression against this superioritie, our predecessors haue chastised
the kings of Scots, and some deposed, and put other in their places. We will heere omit
to speake of the rudenesse of the antiquitie in particularitie, which they cared not distinctlie
to commit to writing. But some authors, as Antonius Sabellicus, amongst other, diligentlie
searching what he might trulie write of all Europe and the Hands adioining, ouer and beside that which he writeth of the natures, maners, and conditions of the Scots, which who
so list to read, shall find to haue b&eacute;ene the verie same in times past, that we find them now
at this present: he calleth Scotland, part of England, which is agr&eacute;eable to the diuision aforesaid, being in d&eacute;ed as in the land continuall without separation of the sea, so also by homage
and fealtie vnited vnto the same; as by particular declarations shall most manifestlie app&eacute;ere, by
the testimonie of such as haue left writing for proofe and confirmation thereof.</p>
<p>"In which matter, passing the death of king Humber, the acts of Dunwald king of this
realme of England, the diuision of Beline and Bren two brethren, the victories of king Arthur;
we shall begin at the y&eacute;ere of our Lord, nine hundred, which is six hundred fortie two
yeeres past, a time of sufficient anciencie, from which we shall make speciall declaration and
euident proofe of the execution of our right and title of superioritie euermore continued and
preserued hitherto. Edward the first, before the conquest, sonne to Alured king of England,
had vnder his dominion and obedience the king of Scots. And h&eacute;ere is to be noted, that
this matter was so notorious and manifest, as Marian a Scot, writing that storie in those daies,
granteth, confesseth, &amp; testifieth the same: and this dominion continued in that state thr&eacute;e
and twentie y&eacute;eres.</p>
<p>At which time Athelstane succ&eacute;eded in the crowne of England, and hauing by battell conquered Scotland, he made one Constantine king of that partie, to rule and gouerne the countrie of Scotland, he vnder him, adding this princelie woord, that it was more honorable to him
to make a king, than to be a king. Twentie foure y&eacute;eres after that, which was the y&eacute;ere of
our Lord 947, king Eldred our progenitor Athelstanes brother, tooke homage of Irise then
king of Scots. Thirtie y&eacute;eres after that, which was in the yeere of our Lord 977, king Edgar
our predecessor tooke homage of Kinald king of Scots. Heere was a little trouble in England by the death of saint Edward king and martyr, destroied by the deceit of his mother in
law. But yet within memorie, fortie yeers after the homage doone by Kinald to king Edgar,
that is to say, in the yeere of our Lord 1018, Malcolme king of Scots did homage to Knute
our predecessor.</p>
<p>"After this homage doone, the Scots vttered some p&eacute;ece of their naturall disposition:

wherevpon, by warre made by our progenitor saint Edward the confessor, twentie nine y&eacute;eres
after homage doone, that is to say, the y&eacute;ere of our Lord 1056, Malcolme king of Seets
was vanquished, and the realme giuen to Malcolme his sonne, by our said progenitor saint
Edward: to whome the said Malcolme made homage and fealtie, within eleuen yeares after
that William Conqueror entered this realme, whereof he accounted no perfect conquest, vntill
he had likewise subdued the Scots. And therefore in the said y&eacute;ere, which was in the y&eacute;ere
of our Lord 1068, the said Malcolme king of Scots did homage to the said William Conqueror, as his superior by conquest king of England. Twentie fiue y&eacute;eres after that, which
was in the y&eacute;ere of our Lord 1092, the said Malcolme did homage and fealie to William
Rufus, sonne to the said William Conqueror: and yet after that was for his offenses and demerits deposed, and his sonne substitute in his place, who likewise failed of his dutie: and
therefore was ordeined in that estate (by the said William Rufus) Edgar, brother to the last
Malcolme, and sonne to the first, who did homage and fealtie accordinglie.</p>
<p>"Seuen y&eacute;eres after, that was in the y&eacute;ere of our Lord 1100, the said Edgar K. of Scots
did homage vnto Henrie the first our progenitor. Thirtie seauen y&eacute;eres after that, Dauid king
of Scots did homage to Mathild the empresse, as daughter and heire to Henrie the first.
Wherefore, being after required by Stephan, then obteining possession of the realme, to make
his homage; he refused so to doo, because he had before made it to the said Mathild, and
therevpon forbare. After which Dauids death, which insued shortlie after, the sonne of the
said Dauid made homage to the said king Stephan. Fouret&eacute;ene y&eacute;eres after that, which was
in the y&eacute;ere of our Lord, a thousand one hundred and fiftie, William king of Scots, and Dauid his brother, with all the nobles of Scotland, made homage to Henrie the seconds sonne,
with a reseruation of their dutie to Henrie the second his father. Twentie fiue y&eacute;eres after,
which was in the yeere of our Lord 1175, William king of Scotland, after much rebellion &amp;
resistance, according to their naturall inclination, king Henrie the second then being in Normandie, William then king of Scots knowledged finallie his error, and made his peace and
composition, confirmed with his great seale, and the seales of the nobilitie of Scotland, making therewith his homage and fealtie.</p>
<p>"Within fifteene yeeres after that, which was the yeere of our Lord 1190, the said William king of Scots came to our citie of Canturburie, and there did homage to our noole progenitor king Richard the first. Fourt&eacute;ene yeeres after that, the said William did homage to our
progenitor king Iohn, vpon a hill besides Lincolne, making his oth vpon the crosse of Hubert
then archbishop of Canturburie, being there present, a maruellous multitude assembled for
that purpose. Twentie six y&eacute;eres after that, which was in the y&eacute;ere of our Lord 1216, Alexander king of Scots maried Margaret, the daughter of our progenitor Henrie the third, at
our citie of Yorke, in the feast of Christmasse, at which time the said Alexander did his homage to our said progenitor, who reigned in this realme fiftie six yeers. And therfore betw&eacute;ene the homage made by the said Alexander king of Scots, and the homage doone by
Alexander, sonne to the said king of Scots, to Edward the first at his coronation at Westminster,
there was about fiftie y&eacute;eres: at which time the said Alexander king of Scots repaired to the
said feast of coronation, and there did his dutie, as is aforesaid. Within twentie eight
y&eacute;eres after that, which was in the y&eacute;ere of our Lord 1282, Iohn Balioll king of Scots made
his homage and fealtie to the said king Edward the first our progenitor.</p>
<p>"After this began Robert Bruse to vsurpe the crowne of Scotland, and to mooue sedition
therefore against them of the house of Balioll, which made for a season some interruption in
the said homage; but yet no intermission without the termes of memorie: for within fortie
foure y&eacute;eres after, which was the y&eacute;ere of our Lord 1326, Edward Balioll after a great victorie
had in Scotland against the other faction, and inioieng the crowne of Scotland, made homage
to our progenitor Edward the third. And twentie y&eacute;eres after that, which was in the yeere of
our Lord 1346, Dauid Bruse, who was euer in the contrarie faction, did neuerthelesse in the
title of the crowne of Scotland, wherof he was then in possession, make homage to our said
progenitor Edward the third.</p>

<p>"Within nine yeeres after this, Edward the third, to chastise the infidelitie of the Scots,
made warre against them: when after great victories, Edward Balioll, hauing the iust and right
title to the realme of Scotland, surrendred clearlie the same to our said progenitor, at the towne
of Roxburgh in Scotland, where our said progenitor accepted the same, and then caused
himselfe to be crowned king of Scotland, and for a time interteined it, and inioied it, as verie
proprietarie and owner of the realme: as on the one part by confiscation acquited, and on the
other part by fr&eacute;e will surrendred vnto him. And then after the death of our said progenitor Edward the third, began seditions and insurrections in this our realme, in the time of
our progenitor Richard the second, which was augmented by the alteration of the state of
the said Richard, and the deuolution of the same to Henrie the fourth: so as the Scots had
some leasure to plaie their vagues, and follow their accustomed manner. And yet Henrie
the fift, for recouerie of his right in France, commanded the king of Scots to attend vpon
him in that iorneie.</p>
<p>In this time, the realme of Scotland being descended to the house of the Stewards, of
which our nephue directlie commeth: Iames Steward king of Scots, in the y&eacute;ere of our Lord
1423, made homage to Henrie the sixt at Windsore, which homage was distant from the time of
the other homage made by Dauid Bruse, three score y&eacute;eres and more, but farre within the fresh
memorie of man. All which homages and fealties as they app&eacute;ere by storie to haue b&eacute;ene
made and doone at times and seasons as afore, so doo there remaine instruments made
therevpon, and sealed with the seales of the kings of Scotland, testifieng the same. And yet
dooth it app&eacute;ere by storie, how the Scots practised to steale out of our treasurie diuerse of
these instruments, which neuerthelesse were afterward recouered againe.</p>
<p>"And to the intent ye may know of what forme and tenure the said instruments be, h&eacute;ere is
inserted the effect in woord and sentence as they be made, which we doo, to m&eacute;et with the cauillation and contriued euasion of the Scots, alleging the homage to haue beene made for the
earledome of Huntington, which is as true as the allegation of him that is burnt in the hand,
to say he was cut with a sickle. And therefore the tenure of the homage is this.</p>

<p>"Now for the third part, touching records and registers, we haue them so formall, so autenticall, so seriouslie handled, and with such circumstances declaring the matters, as they be
and ought to be a great corroboration of that hath beene in stories written &amp; reported in
this matter. For among other things we haue the solemne act and iudiciall processe of our
progenitor Edward the first, in discussion of the title of Scotland, when the same was challenged by 12 competitors (that is to saie) Florentius comes Holandie, Patricius de Dunbar
comes de Merchia, Willielmus de Vesci, Willielmus de Rosse, Robertus de Pinkeni, Nicholaus de Soules, Patricius Galightlie, Rogerus de Mundeuile, Ioannes de Comin, D. Ioannes
de Hastings, Ioannes de Balliolo, Robertus de Bruse, Ericius rex Norwegie.</p>
<p>"Finallie, after a great consultation and mature deliberation, with discussion of the allegations proponed on all parts, sentence was giuen for the title of Balioll, according wherevnto he inioied the realme. But for confirmation of the dutie of the homage before that time
obserued by the K. of Scots, it appeareth in those records, how when those competitors of
the realme of Scotland repaired to our progenitor, as to the chiefe lord for discussion of the
same, insomuch as the authoritie of the iudgement to be giuen depended therevpon; it was

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"then"</fw>-->

<pb n="525"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"525"</fw>-->

then ordered that the whole parlement of Scotland, spirituall &amp; temporall, &amp; of all degrees
assembled for that purpose, and considering vpon what ground &amp; foundation the kings of
Scotland had in times past made the said homages and recognition of superioritie, the said
parlement finding the same good &amp; true, should (if they so d&eacute;emed it) y&eacute;eld and giue place,
and by expresse consent recognise the same.</p>
<p>"At which parlement was alleged vnto them, as appeareth in the same records, not onelie
these acts of the princes before those daies, and before rehearsed: but also besides the testimonie of stories, the writings and letters of forren princes at that time reciting and rehearsing the same. Wherevpon the said parlement did there agree to this our superioritie, and
insuing their determination did particularlie and seuerallie make homage &amp; fealtie with proclamation, that whosoeuer withdrew himselfe from dooing his duetie therein, should be reputed as a rebell. And so all made homage and fealtie to our progenitor Edward the first.
And the realme of Scotland was in the time of the discussion of the title ruled by gardians
deputed by him. All castels and holds were surrendred to him, as to the superiour lord in
the time of vacation. Benefices, offices, f&eacute;es, promotions passed in that time from the m&eacute;ere
gift of our said progenitor as in the right of this crowne of England. Shiriffes named and
appointed, writs, and precepts made, obeied, and executed.</p>
<p>"Finallie, all that we doo now in the duchie of Lancaster, the same did our progenitor
for the time of the contention for that title in the realme of Scotland, by the consent of an agr&eacute;ement of all estates of the realme assembled and consulted with for that purpose. At which
time the bishops of saint Andrews and Glascow were not (as they now be) archbishops;
but recognised the archbishop of Yorke, which extended ouer all that countrie. Now if the
Scots will take exception to the homage of their princes as made in warre, and by force,
which is not true; what will they say, or can they for shame allege against their owne parlement, not of some but of all confirmed, &amp; testified by their writings and seales; wherevnto
nothing inforced them but right and reason, being passed in peace and quiet without armor
&amp; compulsion? If they say they did it not, they speake like themselues; if they say they did
it, then doo they now like themselues, to withdraw their dutie, not so much to be blamed, as
to be amended.</p>
<p>"Thus appeareth vnto you the beginning of the right of superioritie, with a perpetuall continuance, without intermission within memorie. Certeine omissions and forbearings vpon the
grounds and occasions before specified we denie not, whereby they haue manie times sought
and taken their opportunities to withdraw the dooing of their duetie in knowledge of our superioritie ouer them; which to auoid, they haue not cared what they said or alleged, though
it were neuer so vntrue, lieng alwaies in wait when they might annoie this realme, not without
their owne great danger &amp; perill, &amp; also extreame detriment. But as they detracted the dooing
of their dutie, so God granted vnto this realme force to compell them therevnto within memorie, and notwithstanding anie their interruption by resistance, which vnto the time of our
progenitor Henrie the sixt neuer endured so long as it made intermission within time of mind,
whereby the possession might s&eacute;eme to be empaired. From the time of Henrie the sixt,
vnto the seuenth yeare of our reigne, our realme hath b&eacute;ene for a season lacerat and torne by
diuersitie of titles, till our time; and since also by warre outwardlie vexed and troubled. The
storie is so lamentable for some part therof, as were too tedious to rehearse.</p>
<p>"Since the death of our progenitor Henrie the sixt, our grandfather Edward the fourth
reigned, who after great trauels to atteine quietnes in his realme, finallie in the time of preparation of warre against Scotland died. Richard the third, then vsurped for a small time
in yeares, whome the king our father by the strength of Gods hand ouerthrew in battell,
and most iusdie atteined the possession of this relme, who neuerthelesse, after the great tempestuous stormes, finding all matters not yet brought to perfect quiet and rest, ceassed and
forbare to require of he Scots to doo their dutie; thinking it policie rather for that time to
assaie to tame their nature by pleasant coniunction &amp; conuersation of affinitie, than to charge
them with their fault, &amp; require dutie of them, when oportunitie serued not by force &amp; feare

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"to"</fw>-->

<pb n="526"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"526"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

to constreine and compell them. And thus passed ouer the reigne of our father without demand of this homage. And being our reigne now foure and thirtie yeares, we were one and
twentie yeares letted by our nephue his minoritie, being then more carefull how to bring
him out of danger, to the place of a king, than to receiue of him homage, when he had full
possession of the same.</p>
<p>"Wherefore being now passed, since the last homage made by the king of Scots, to our
progenitor Henrie the sixt, 122 yeares, at which time the homage was doone at Windsor by
Iames Steward, then king of Scots, as before 56 of these yeares the crowne of this realme
was in contention, the trouble wherof ingendred also some businesse in the time of the king
our father; which was thr&eacute;e and tiurtie yeares: and in our time one and twentie yeares
hath passed in the minoritie of our nephue. So as finallie, the Scots resorting to their onelie defense of discontinuance of possession, can onelie allege iustlie but 13 yeares of silence
in the time of our reigne, being all the other times since the homage doone by Iames Steward,
such as the silence in them (had they b&eacute;ene neuer so long) could not haue ingendred preiudice to the losse of anie right that may yet be declared and prooued due. For what can
be imputed to king Edward for not demanding homage being in strife for that estate, wherevnto the homage was due? What should Richard the third search for homage in Scotland,
that had neither right ne leasure to haue homage doone vnto him in England? Who can
blame our father, knowing the Scots nature neuer to doo their dutie but for feare; if he demanded not that of them, which they would eschew if they might, s&eacute;eing his realme not
clearelie then purged from ill s&eacute;ed of sedition, sparkled and scattered in the cruell ciuill
warres before.</p>
<p>"Law and reason serueth, that the passing ouer of time not commodious, that the purpose is not allegable in prescription for the losse of anie right. And the minoritie of the
king of Scots hath indured twentie one y&eacute;eres of our reigne, which being an impediment on
their part, the whole prescription of the Scots, if the matter were prescriptible, is thus deduced
euidentlie to thirteene y&eacute;ere, which thirt&eacute;ene y&eacute;ere without excuse we haue ceassed and forborne to demand our dutie, like as the Scots haue likewise ceassed to offer and render the
same: for which cause neuerthelesse we doo not enter this warre, ne minded to demand
anie such matter now, being rather desirous to reioise and take comfort in the friendship of
our nephue as our neighbour, than to mooue matter vnto him of displeasure, whereby to
alienate such naturall inclination of loue as he should haue towards vs: but such be the
woorks of God superior ouer all, to suffer occasions to be ministred, whereby due superioritie
may be knowne, demanded, and required, to the intent that according therevnto all things
gouerned in due order h&eacute;ere, we may to his pleasure passe ouer this life to his honor and
glorie, which he grant vs to doo in such rest, peace, and tranquillitie, as shall be meet and
conuenient for vs."</p>

<p>When therefore the king of England had set foorth this declaration of the causes that
mooued him to make warre against Scotland, he prepared to prosecute the same both by
sea and land, and hauing rigged and furnished diuerse ships of warre, he sent the same foorth
to the sea, that they might take such Scotish ships as were to returne from their voiages made
<note place="marg">Scotish ships taken.</note>
into France, Flanders, Denmarke, and other countries, whether they were gone for trade of
merchandize, with which the English ships incountred, tooke 28 of the principall ships of
all Scotland, fraught with all kind of merchandize and rich wares, which they brought with
them into the English ports.</p>
<p>The king of Scotland aduertised therof, sent with all sp&eacute;ed an herald, desiring restitution of
his ships, as he thought stood with reason, s&eacute;eing no war was proclamed: but the king of
England thought it no reason to depart with theem so soone, till other articles of agr&eacute;ement
might be concluded, and therefore refused not onelie to deliuer their ships, but also sent sir
Robert Bowes with men to the borders, giuing him in charge to inuade Scotland, who 
<note place="marg">Sir Robert Bowes inuadeth the borders.</note>
according to his commission, with thr&eacute;e thousand men rode into Scotland, and began to burne

and to spoile certeine small townes: wherevpon the fraie being raised in the countrie, George
<note place="marg">The earle of Huntleie giueth an ouerthrow to the Englishmen.</note>

<note place="marg">1542. <emph>Lesle.</emph></note>
Gordon the earle of Huntleie, who was appointed to remaine as lieutenant vpon the borders,
for doubt of such sudden inuasions, immediatlie gathered a number of borderers, and set
vpon the Englishmen, and put them all to flight; sir Robert Bowes, and his brother Richard
Bowes, with diuerse other, to the number of six hundred, were taken prisoners; and the
said sir Robert Bowes and other the principall landed men were kept still in Scotland till
after the kings death. This victorie chanced to the Scots, at a place called Halden Rig in the
Mers, vpon saint Bartholomewes day, which is the twentie fourth of August.</p>
<p>After this, the king of England sent the duke of Norffolke with the earles of Shrewesburie, Darbie, Cumberland, Surreie, Hertford, Angus, Rutland, and the lords of the north
parts of England, with an armie of fortie thousand men, as the Scots est&eacute;emed them, though
they were not manie aboue twentie thousand, who entered into Scotland the one and twentith of October, and burnt certeine townes vpon the side of the water Tw&eacute;ed: but the earle
of Huntleie, hauing with him ten thousand of the borderers and other, so waited vpon them,
giuing them now and then skirmishes and alarms, that they came not past two miles from the
water of Tw&eacute;ed within the Scotish bounds at that season.</p>
<p>In the meane time, the king of Scotland being aduertised h&eacute;ereof, gathered a great armie
through all the parts of his realme, and came to Sowtraie hedge, where they mustered, and
were numbred to be thirtie six thousand men, with the which he came to Falla Mure, and
there incamped, determining to giue battell to the Englishmen, as he pretended: howbbeit,
if the duke had taried longer, as it was thought he would haue doone, if the time of the
y&eacute;ere and prouision of vittels had serued, the Scots would yet haue b&eacute;ene better aduised,
before they had ioined with him in a pight field. But true it is, that after the duke had
remained there so long as vittels might be had and recouered from anie part, he retired with
his armie backe into England, not without some losse of men, horsses, and spoiles, which the
Scots vnder the earle of Huntleie and others tooke from the Englishmen in that their retire,
speciallie as they passed ouer the riuer of Tweed.</p>
<p>After the Englishmen were thus departed and withdrawne home foorth of Scotland, king
Iames being of an high and manlie courage, in reuenge of harmes doone by the Englishmen
within his countrie, thought good that his whole armie should passe forward and inuade
England, himselfe to go therewith in proper person. And h&eacute;erein he requested the consent of his nobilitie, who after long reasoning, and good aduisement taken in the matter,
gaue answer [by the earle of Murrey] to the king in this sort, that they could not thinke it
good that they should passe within England, and to seeke battell, the king himselfe
being with them, considering that his two sons were latelie deceassed, so that he had no
succession of his bodie: for in ease that they lost the field, as in chance of battell is
most vncerteine, then the king of England hauing great substance, might therwith follow
the victorie, and put the realme of Scotland in great hazard.</p>
<p>Therefore they thought it sufficient to defend their owne bounds, and to constreine the
enimie for feare to leaue the inuasion thereof, as presentlie they had doone; and declared
that they were determined to haue giuen battell to their enimies, if they had continued within
the realme, and doubted not by the helpe of God, they hauing so iust a cause, and being
inuaded in their countrie, but that they should haue obteined the victorie. The king hearing

residue of the gentlemen of his houshold. These earles and lords entering into England on
saint Katharines euen, being the foure and twentith of Nouember, began to burne certeine
townes vpon the water of Eske. But as soone as the scrie was raised in the countrie, of
lord Wharton warden of the west marches of England, suddenlie raised the power the
<note place="marg">The lord Wharton.</note>
the countrie, and came to a little hill, where they shewed themselues in sight vnto the Scotish
armie.</p>
<p>The Scotish lords perceiuing the Englishmen gathered, assembled themselues togither,
and inquired who was lieutenant generall there by the kings appointment; and incontinentlie
Oliuer Sincler was holden vp on two mens shoulders, where he sheweth foorth the kings

commission, instituting him lieutenant to the king of that armie. But howsoeuer that was read,
the earles and lords there present, thought themselues imbased too much, to haue such a
meane gentleman aduanced in authoritie aboue them all, and therefore determined not to
fight vnder such a capteine, but willinglie suffered themselues to be ouercome, and so were
taken by the Englishmen, not shewing anie countenance of defense to the contrarie, and
<note place="marg">The Scots discomfited by the Englishmen.</note>
without slaughter of anie one person on either side.</p>
<p>This rode was called Solowaie Mosse, at the which were taken prisoners men of name,
these persons following: the earle of Cassiles and Glencarne, the lord Maxwell, the lord
Fleming, the lord Someruile, the lord Oliphant, Oliuer Sincler, the lord of Craggie, and
sundrie other gentlemen, the which were led prisoners to London, where they remained till
after the king was dead. The king being in Carlauerocke vpon the borders not farre from
Solowaie Mosse, when this misfortune fell vpon his men: after he heard thereof, he was
meruelouslie amazed, the more, in calling to remembrance the refusall made by his nobles, assembled with him in campe at Falla vpon his request to inuade England. H&eacute;erewith such
<note place="marg">The griefe of the king for the ouerthrow of his men.</note>
an impression entered his mind, that he thought with himselfe that all his whole nobilitie
had conspired against him, and therevpon tooke such a vehement and high displeasure, increased with a melancholious thought, that he departed suddenlie from thence to Edenburgh,
and after remooued to Falkeland, where he remained as a man desolate of comfort, being
sore vexed in spirit and bodie, and would not permit anie manner of person to haue accesse
to him, his secret &amp; familiar seruants onelie excepted.</p>
<p>Now, as he was thus disquieted, newes were brought him that the queene his wife was
brought to bed of a faire yoong princesse the seuenth day of December, the which newes
<note place="marg">The birth of the Scotish qu&eacute;ene.</note>
he liked verie euill; and added the griefe thereof to his former displeasantnesse, insomuch that
he perceiued the end of his life to approch, and withall said, that he foresaw great trouble to
come vpon the realme of Scotland, for the pursuit which the king of England was like to
make therevpon against the same, to the end he might bring it vnder his subiection, either
by mariage, or by some other meane. It was reported that he was disquieted with some
vnkindlie medicine: but howsoeuer the matter was, he y&eacute;elded vp his spirit to almightie
God, and departed this world the fouret&eacute;enth of December, in the y&eacute;ere of our redemption,
1542, the thirtie thr&eacute;e yeere of his age, and thirtie two of his reigne.</p>
<p>Shortlie after his departure, his bodie was conueied into Falkeland vnto Edenburgh in
most honorable wise; the cardinall, the earles of Arrane, Argile, Rothes, Marshall, and diuerse other noblemen being present, and with all funerall pompe (as was requisite) it was
buried in the abbeie church of Holie rood house, beside the bodie of qu&eacute;ene Magdalen,
daughter to the king of France, his first wife. There was great lamentation and mone made
for his death throughout all parts of his realme, for he was verie well beloued among his subiects. * He was of sw&eacute;et countenance and courteous speech, graiesh eied, hauing a diuine

mind, and fores&eacute;eing what might follow with an incredible iudgement: in such sort that h&eacute;e
was neuer vnprouided against the danger of anie thing, or was drawne from it by the difficultie thereof, or was hindered by the obscuritie therein: whereby he might incurre the note

<p>All which singular commendations seemed to flow out of this spring, that he did not by
heat of youth (rashlie) but with great deliberation (soundlie) mannage the whole affaires of
the common-wealth. For as he did chieflie labor that his table might not exc&eacute;ed for gluttonie, nor be ouersparing for miserie: so if his apparell were decent, he esteemed not the
shew of womanish attire after the courtlie fashion. He was so farre from pride, that he alwaies shewed himselfe offended with the vses thereof. He was an obseruer of iustice, a defender
of the law, and a sharpe shield for the innocent and poore: for which cause he was of the
nobilitie called the king of the commoners. For he set at libertie the poore oppressed with
the tyrannie of the rich, and repressed the rich from spoiling of the poore: all which he did
with a certeine seueritie, but yet such, as in the same there appeared a woonderfull gentlenes
of his naturall disposition, bicause he seldome put anie of them to death, but did either by prison
or mulct punish the offense. For he was woont to say, that he would neuer take lire from
anie, but onelie to k&eacute;epe the law sound, and for the example of others: and to k&eacute;epe downe
the boldnesse of such as dwelt about the borders. With these conditions he left the realme
plentifullie furnished with riches, and his owne treasurie not emptie, but abundantly stored
with gold, siluer and other furniture: for which cause it should not s&eacute;eme strange, that
his death was greatlie lamented of his subiects, to whom he was a perfect patrone, and a
louing father.</p>
<p>Of whome also Buchanan lib. 14 writeth, that his vices did almost equall all his great vertues; but that they were rather to be imputed to the iniquitie of the time than the inclination of his nature, for the libertie of althings had then dissolued the publike discipline, which
could not be staied but by great seueritie of correction. And this made him more couetous of monie, bicause that he was kept extreame hard when he was vnder the gouernment
of others. Whereby, when he came to b&eacute;e at libertie, he was anew to furnish all his courts
with houshold stuffe, finding his houses emptie, and all things conueied awaie: for his tutors had consumed the kinglie patrimonie vpon those whome he willinglie would not to haue
receiued it. Besides, for his excesse of women the fault grew by such as were his tutors,
who gaue him libertie thereto, supposing therby to keepe him the longer in their danger.
The nobilitie did not greatlie take his death grieuouslie, bicause he had fined manie, imprisoned more, and caused no small few (for auoiding his displeasure) to file into England,
and rather to commit themselues to the enimie than to his anger.)</p>

<p>These lords anriuing at Edenburgh, about the midst of Ianuarie, declared to the gouernor their message and proposition made by the king of England, with such efficacie, that
the gouernor being persuaded thereto by their words, sent for the lords and nobilitie of the

Leirmouth, and the secretarie being named and appointed thereto, departed in the moneth
of March, and comming into England vnto the king, remained there till the latter end of
Iulie. In which meane time, such couenants, contracts, and promises were had and concluded, passed and sealed interchangeablie, as stood with the pleasure and good liking of
king Henrie, so as the mariage was fullie contracted, and a peace concluded for ten yeeres,
<note place="marg">The mariage confirmed.</note>
by authoritie of the aforesaid parlement. H&eacute;erewith also the lord gouernor shewed himselfe
to imbrace the reformed religion, causing one frier Guilliam to preach against images, and
fruitlesse ceremonies, and gaue libertie that the bible called The new and old testament,
should be had in English, &amp; vniuersallie publisht through the realme of Scotland.</p>
<p>Also he commanded not onelie the cardinall (as before ye haue heard) but also ordeined
that the qu&eacute;ene mother should remaine in Lithgow with the yoong qu&eacute;ene hir daughter,
vnder some manner of safe custodie, and the cardinall to be remooued vnto his owne castell

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 465.</note>
cardinall was restored to vnhoped libertie, and the earle of Angus, George Dowglasse, and
the lord Glames, the heire of Iames Hamilton, with manie others, by the consent of the
thr&eacute;e estates, were wholie restored to all their goods, and deliuered from the sentence of
banishment.</p>
<p>Iohn Hamilton abbat of Passelew, brother of the gouernor, returning out of France (where
he had imploied himselfe to studie) did (with certeine learned men, as Dauid Paniter, and
others, whom he had in his companie) visit the king of England, of whome they were most
courteouslie interteined. After which this Hamilton returning into Scotland, was made
treasuror of the kingdome, which office he discharged with great commendation, so long as
his brother kept the gouernement, whom he did not onelie helpe in counsell for ordering of
the kingdome, but also shewed him selfe a valiant and industrious man in the warres against
the English, for defense of the kingdome of Scotland. About this time, the earle Bothwell, which was banished, and had remained long at Venice, did returne into Scotland,
whither he was honorablie welcommed, as a person much desired of his friends and kinred.)</p>
<p>The realme being thus brought in quiet, and vnder good gouernement, the French king
<note place="marg">The French king misliketh of the match with England.</note>
sore misliking this new coniunction of the Scots with England, and doubting least the old
former bond of aliance betwixt France and Scotland might thereby be vtterlie dissolued and
shaken off, he sent for Matthew Steward earle of Lennox, then abroad in his seruice in the
<note place="marg">Matthew earle of Lennox.</note>
wars of Italie, and vpon his comming backe from thence to the court, he declared to him
the deceasse of the late king of Scots, the intrusion of Arrane, and the attempts in that
realme begun, with all the circumstances from point to point as he knew; and further discoursed with him what wrong he had to be set aside, and displaced from his right of gouernement; and therefore exhorted him to repaire home to recouer the same, offering not
onelie to assist him with men, monie, and munition, but also to ioine his friends in Scotland with him in aid to attaine the place of regiment, and to remooue Arrane and others
from it.</p>
<p>The earle of Lennox h&eacute;erevpon with commission and instructions deliuered to him by
the French king, had also letters from him directed to the lords that were of the French
faction, wherin the said king requested them to remaine and continue in their former good
meanings towards him, and to assist the earle of Lennox in all things, as should be thought
expedient. * Now, before the earle of Lennox returned out of France, the cardinall had

vsed manie persuasions against the English, as well that the Scots set at libertie by the king,

to suffer their pledges to receiue what king Henrie would vse vnto them, than by k&eacute;eping
promise to the English, to conueie the yoong qu&eacute;ene vnto them.</p>
<p>Wherevpon, when the greater part of those nobles (whome the matter touched, could
easilie find anie color for the excuse of their fault had consented to the cardinals persuasion, onelie one amongest the rest would not y&eacute;eld thereto, which was Gilbert Kennedie

earle of Cassiles, who could not be drawen from that constancie (in obseruing his faith)
either by bribes, flatteries, or threats. For he (hauing two brothers pledges for him in England) did openlie protest, that he would returne to prison, and by no feare laid before him
commit such a fault, as that he would red&eacute;erne his life with the bloud of his two brothers:
for which cause he went foorthwith to London, although euerie man spake against it.
Wherevpon, the king of England did singulrlie commend the constancie of the yoong man,
and further (to the end that his vertue might be knowne to all men) did set him at libertie
with his two brethren, and sent him home honorablie rewarded.</p>
<p>Now the realme of Scotland being thus in great vprores by means of the qu&eacute;enes and
cardinals factions, whereof the last drew all (such as he could) to support the French
league, they sent ambassadors into France, to request the French king to send home Matthew
Steward earle of Lennox, as one that was not onelie emulous against Hamilton, but also
his deadlie enimie for the slaughter of his father at Limnucho : which yoong Steward (beside his beautie and comelinesse of bodie, in the verie flower of his youth; the memorie,
carefulnesse, and dangers of his father, a verie popular man, and beloued of the people;
the woorthinesse of that farnilie brought almost to an end, and that the same was of great
power, and linked in mariage with manie nobles) did win and draw the minds of manie
men, desirous to helpe him, for the great fauor they bare vnto him.</p>
<p>To the which further procurement of the peoples loue also, there might be ioined, that
he was next heire to the crowne by the kings appointment, if he died without issue male;
the which king Iames, if he had liued, would haue established by parlement: besides which
likewise, there wanted not flatterers, which did not onelie stirre vp his noble mind (now
gaping after great things, and vndefended against deceits) to the hope of gouerning of the
kingdome for these one and twentie y&eacute;eres and more, during the qu&eacute;enes minoritie, and to
the rule and power ouer his enimies, whereby he might vse reuenge vpon them: but also
they promised him to marrie the qu&eacute;ene Dowager: and in the meane time (if anie thing happened otherwise than well to the yoong qu&eacute;ene) that he should obteine the crowne, whereby
he should both be king, and the next lawfull heire of Iames Hamilton latelie deceassed,
since the gouernor was a bastard, and could not onelie by law not looke or hope for the
kingdome, but also not so much as hope to be heire to his owne familie. To all which
were added the persuasions of the French before mentioned. Wherevpon, the yoong man
(whose mind was credulous, being tickled and intised with these hopes) determined to go
into Scotland.)</p>
<p>The earle therefore fullie instructed by the French king, how to deale and proc&eacute;ed, tooke
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox passeth into Scotland.</note>
his leaue, and with all sp&eacute;ed taking the sea, directed his course into Scotland, where
(after his arriuall) he came to Edeuburgh, in which towne all the lords being assembled togither with the gouernor, he declared to them the effect of his commission from the French
king, his request to them, &amp; good affection to mainteine them against England, if in case
they would continue the old league with him, and not s&eacute;eke to make anie new aliance with
the king of England.</p>
<p>But perceiuing that the gouernor and his friends were minded to satisfie the king of Englands desires, he would not tarrie for a resolute answer, but by the counsell of the earle of
Argile, William earle of Glencarne, and others of the French faction, he suddenlie departed
foorth of Edenburgh toward the west countrie, highlie displeased (as should s&eacute;ene) with
the gouernor, and taking Lithgow in his way, he conferred with the qu&eacute;ene Dowager (as
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox conferreth with the qu&eacute;ene Dowager.</note>

and hir daughter to libertie, out of the danger of the lord gouernor: because it was supposed that he ment to conueie hir into England.</p>

the king of England of all the drifts of Lennox, and other of that faction, requiring his
aduise and counsell how to deale for disappointing of their purposes, that sought to continue
the amitie still with France, to the preiudice of peace with England.</p>

England, there to remaine, till the mariage might be consummate betwixt hir and his sonne

vpon hir, and to see to hir bringing vp, as should be thought expedient. To conclude, his
maiestie not onelie sent his princelie comfort by waie of counsell and good aduise, but also
according to their desire, and as by the duke of Suffolke (his highnes lieutenant then in the

inough frame to be at his appointment) rather than Lennox that was knowne to be of a

to order things as he thought good, appointing the gouernor to beare the crowne as chiefe

the coronation, a parlement was called and holden at Edenburgh, at the which, in presence

monsieur la Brosse, and monsieur Menage, latelie before come into the realme, the earle of

with the old qu&eacute;ene hir mother in Sterling castell, during hir minoritie, and certeine rents of

him in remembrance of the promises made to him when he departed from him; also the constantnesse of his seruice, the hazard he had put himselfe in for his sake: and notwithstanding how he was yet vnkindlie dealt with, that through trust of his promised aid and assistance,

he was brought out of credit in his countrie, and subiected vnder the commandement and
authoritie of his enimie, and wrongfullie disappointed of his right, which he looked to haue
recouered, and to haue b&eacute;ene mainteined therein by his support.</p>
<p>In consideration whereof, he renounced his seruice, willing him from thencefoorth not

earles of Angus, Cassiles, and Glencarne, the lords Maxwell, and Someruile, the shiriffe of
Aire, the lard of Drumlanrig, and other of that side, called the English lords, set himselfe
against the gouernor, the cardinall, and others of that faction, so that the residue of this
yeere was spent in ciuill dissention betweene them. And h&eacute;ere is to be noted, that a little

<note place="marg">French ships arriuing in the riuer of Cloide.</note>
before that the earle of Arrane reuolted to the French part, there was arriued in the mouth
of the riuer of Cloide on the west coast, fiue ships, which the French king had sent to the
aid of his friends in Scotland, vnder the conduction of Iames Steward of Cardonold, and of
the forenamed monsieur de la Brosse, &amp; monsieur Menage, the French kings ambassadors.</p>
<p>There came with them also the patriarch of Apuleia, of whome ye haue likewise heard
before. They had brought aboord in these ships fiftie thousand crownes, and munition to
the value of ten thousand crownes. The earle of Lennox therefore, when he first resolued
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox seized vpon the French ships.</note>
to turne to the English part, with the aduise of his confederats, seized vpon those ships,
got the fiftie thousand crownes, and the most part of the munition into his hands, and brought
it to the castell of Dunbreton, reteining it to his owne vse, where it was sent to haue beene
imploid to the maintenance of the French faction, against the king of England, and the lords
that leaned to his side.</p>
<p>The earle of Lennox therefore, raising a power of men of warre with the assistance of

the lords of his faction, came with them vnto Leith against the gouernor that was then in

went both to Lithquho, from whence the earle of Lennox secretlie departed from the gouernor
without bidding him farewell, and comming to Glascow, fortified the castell.</p>
<p>* When the gouernor had receiued true intelligence that the earle had taken Glascow, he
(assembling such power as he could make, as well of his friends and followers, as of others,
especiallie of the lord Boid) went vnto Glascow, in which place the earle of Glencarne had

the battell, the earle of Lennox had withdrawen himselfe vnto Dunbreton, to gather a
greater assemblie, shortlie after to returne to Glascow. The earle of Glencarne, with Tilbarne, Houstone, Buchanan, Macfarlane, Drumquhassile, and other barons and nobles of
the Lennox, Ramfrie, and other places adioining, with the citizens, ecclesiasticall persons
of all orders, and the other sort of common people, departed out of the towne to the plaine
thereof (being a mile from the towne) there to trie the euent of battell (before the comming
of the earle of Lennox) more in haste than good-sp&eacute;ed. Wherevpon the gouernor (perceiuing himselfe to be drawne forward to battell) commanded the trumpets to sound to the
alarmes. Wherevpon the battels ioined, the hosts began to fight violentlie, and the conflict
grew to be extreme on both parts: in which (with great slaughter) they long time fought
with vncerteine victorie.</p>
<p>But in the end (what with the force of his armie, and the incouragement of the capteine)
the full conquest fell to the gouernor, who put his enimies to flight. At what time, of the
fauourers of the Lennox there were manie slaine, partlie of the nobles (as the sonne of the
earle of Glencarne, and Monniepennie capteine of the footmen) and partlie of the common
sort (as the citizens of Glascow, and manie ecclesiasticall persons.) Besides all which, there
had manie more perished, if the gouernor (through his naturall clemencie) had not (when

the victorie began to leane towards him) giuen a signe of retreit, &amp; with much sp&eacute;ed saued
manie of them. On the gouernors part were few missing, except Cambusketh (the head
of that familie) and the baron of Argentine. The gouernor pursuing this victorie, entered
the towne of Glascow, where he vsed (by the persuasion of the lord Boid) woonderfull
fauour towards the citizens, (farre beyond their deserts) although that he depriued some
(of the chiefest condition amongest them) from all the vse and benefit of their goods.</p>
<p>The earle of Lennox remaining at Dunbar, receiued into the castell the earle of Glencarne, and others, which had escaped the battell, who sometime after did rest (being feared
with the ouerthrow) from anie further turmoiles or troubles. But in the end, they which
fauoured the Lennox, doo afresh stirre him to take weapon against the gouernor: wherevpon he dooth restrengthen the towne and steeple of Glascow, determining to gather a new
supplie, and once more to cast the dice of war. But the gouernor (minding to preuent all
his indeuors by wise counsell) did (being accompanied with the cardinall) call to him
about Glascow, all the nobilitie of the south parts, and (bringing foorth the hired souldiors)
commanded the great p&eacute;eces to be planted against the enmie. Wherevpon (entering the
towne) he besieged the castell and steeple of the church (in which place were both Scots
and Frenchmen) and in the end (after a slaughter of some of them) inforced the other to
y&eacute;eld their forts. After that the castell was thus come into the gouernors hands, he hanged
eighteene of the chiefest and best loued vnto Lennox, and permitted the rest to depart at
libertie. The earle of Lennox (vnderstanding that his affaires began to wauer, and to obteine such euill successe) dooth send the earle of Angus and the lord Maxwell to the gouernor to intreat of peace betwe ne him and the earle of Lennox, the which they laboured
with great diligence, according to the trust reposed in them.]</p>
<p>But the gouernor caused them both to be secretlie conueied from the councell by the
<note place="marg">The earle of Angus and the lord Maxwell committed to ward.</note>
backeside of the blacke friers of Glascow, vnto the castell of Hamilton, and from thence the
earle was sent to Blackenesse. The lord Maxwell was kept still in hold at Hamilton, and
George Dowglas, and the maister of Glencarne in Edenburgh castell. These persons thus
imprisoned stood in great doubt of their liues (as some supposed :) but as diuerse other

did suspect, they were rather committed for a colour, than for anie euill that was meant towards them. Howsoeuer it was with them, the earle of Lennox by the aduise of his friends
sent the earle of Glencarne, and a gentleman called Thomas Bishop, vnto the king of England with offer of his seruice, and request to haue in mariage the ladie Margaret Dowglasse
daughter to the Earle of Angus, and n&eacute;ece to the said king.</p>
<p>* Herevnto the king granted. For the performance whereof (and the dispatch of other
things) he sent the lord Wharton and diuerse others. And on the earles part, the bishop
of Cathnes his brother and the earle of Glencarne were appointed, who met at Carleill to
performe the agreement. The qu&eacute;ene, the cardinall, and the other of the French faction,
did helpe the gouernor all they might, with counsell, power, and monie; because they perceiued that he repented such friendship with England as he had taken in hand by the counsell
of Angus and of others. In the meane time there was a parlement assembled at Striueling,
in which by common consent, the earle of Lennox was condemned of treason; wherefore
the sentence of banishment was executed against him, and all his goods with his patrimonie
were confiscat to the qu&eacute;ene. Whilest the French king was ascerteined that Lennox had
forsaken his faction, &amp; committed himselfe to the king of England, he suddenlie committed
to prison Iohn Steward lord of Aubigne baron in France, brother to the earle of Lennox,
and depriued the said Iohn Steward of all such honors and offices as he possessed in France.
For he was generall capteine of all the Scotish lands in France, being either such as had
gard of the kings bodie, or bowmen, or men at armes: for the king of France hath Scots
in wages of all the orders.</p>
<p>But let vs now returne to the Patriarch, who was honorablie receiued by the cardinall and
the bishop of Scotland into the citie of Glascow: during whose abode there, great centention arose betw&eacute;ene the cardinall and the archbishop, of Glascow, who should in that citie

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"be"</fw>-->

<pb n="536"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"536"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

be of greatest authoritie and honor. Which in th' end came to this issue, that both families
fell togither by the eares, which of them should go before with his crosse borne vpright.
For the cardinall archbishop of saint Andrews and primat of the kingdome, did affirme that
the archbishop of Glascow should not haue his crosse borne in his owne church, so long
as the cardinall was present. Which the seruants of the archbishop of Glascow tooke in
such disdaine, that they plucked downe the cardinals crosse and threw it to the ground.
Wherevpon, the gouernor (vnderstanding the whole matter, and that it was now come
from words to swords) made hast to appease this factious commotion, &amp; caused the Patriarch
therwith to be brought to Edenburgh accompanied with the clergie, where he remained all
the winter following. In which towne he was honorablie enterteined and feasted of the
qu&eacute;ene, the gouernor, and other of the nobles, whome he requited with the like courtesie.</p>
<p>Amongest these of the nobilitie, the earle of Murrey had the Patriarch on a day to a
banket, in which this Murrey did shew an honorable thing not accustomed amongest others.
For where he abounded in store of siluer vessels, yet he commanded his seruants to furnish
a great cupboord with christall glasses brought from Venice, &amp; that in the midst of dinner
he should ouerturne the cupboord as it were vnwillinglie. Which the seruant at the
time appointed did performe. The noise of breaking of which glasses did suddenlie fill the
eares of all the companie: and the Patriarch seeing the hurt, was somewhat mooued. But
the earle making no account of this thing, commanded his man afresh to furnish the same
cupboord with as manie and fairer vessels of glasse than the former were, to the Patriarchs
great admiration. For the Patriarch affirmed that the glasses of Muranoe and Venice did
not anie way excell these. Truelie this earle of Murrey was honorable, wise, iust, and
famous amongest manie princes for his manifold vertues, &amp; manie ambassages most happilie
performed amongest them. Who shortlie after this, departing the court, died of the stone
at his castle in Turnwaie.</p>
<p>This Patriarch shewed to the gouernor (besides other priuileges that he had from the s&eacute;e
of Rome) his great authoritie, in that he was legat from the popes side, amongest the Scots,
as long as he remained there. Which office, when he departed to Rome, he procured to
be transferred to the cardinall; at what time the Patriarch also in the name of the pope,
did promise much helpe, and monie to be sent to Scotland against England. For he studied
by all means he could, to hinder the mariage of those two kingdoms: because he suspected
thereby, that some alteration might be made in Scotland touching the religion; with the
ouerthrow of churches and monasteries. Now, after that the Patriarch had remained all the
winter in Scotland, he departed from thence in March, who as he was honorablie enterteined
in all places, so he spared not to recount to the French king and other princes (whome he
visited in his iourneie) the humanitie he found in Scotland, which he also imparted to the
bishop of Rome, to the other cardinals, &amp; to the senat of Venice; not without singular
praise and honor to the Scotish nation.]</p>
<p>They that were sent, so solicited the earles cause, that in the end the king was persuaded
that Lennox ought of right to haue the gouernement of the realme of Scotland, and to be
second person in the same. And herewith, in consideration how vniustlie not onelie his
maiestie had b&eacute;ene dealt with, but also how vnthankefullie and discourteouslie Lennox had
b&eacute;ene vsed, both at the hands of the French king, and also of his adherents in Scotland, by
the cardinall &amp; others: he both thankefullie receiued his gentle offer of seruice, &amp; also
promised to aid him in his title and all other lawfull causes: and herewith prepared an
<note place="marg">The king of England meaneth to aid the earle of Lennox.</note>

<note place="marg">The English armie landeth by Leith.</note>
armie to passe into Scotland by sea, appointing the earle of Hertford, and the lord Lisle to
haue the conduction of the same, who shipping at Tinmouth with their people, arriued in
the Forth vnder Werdie castell, a mile &amp; a halfe aboue Leith the third of Maie, the whole
nauie conteining aboue the number of two hundred ships. Here at Newhauen, a quarter
of a mile from the said castell, they landed their armie of ten thousand men of warre, with
great artillerie, and all kind of munition.</p>
<p>The lord gouernor being at that present within the towne of Edenburgh, hearing of their

arriuall, went foorth of the towne accompanied with the cardinall, the earles of Huntleie,
Argile, Bothwell, and others, purposing to stop their landing: but perceiuing the puissance
of the aduersaries to be such, as they could not resist the same, they returned to Edenburgh
againe, and sent maister Adam Ottenborne prouost of Edenburgh, and two of the bailiffs
<note place="marg">The prouost of Edenburgh sent to the earle of Hertford.</note>
to the earle of Hertford, to vnderstand the cause of his comming; and withall offered,
that if there were anie iniuries or wrongs doone by anie of the Scots nation, he would
appoint commissioners to talke with such as by him should be authorised thereto, for the
full answering thereof, &amp; to that effect he would gladlie receiue them into towne of Edenburgh.</p>
<p>The earle of Hertford answered that he had no commission to talke of anie such matter;
<note place="marg">The earles answer.</note>
but rather to take reuenge of the vniust dealing and breach of promise on those that had
falsified their faith. And therefore minding to burne the towne of Edenburgh, as well as
other within that realme, he willed the inhabitants and all those that were within the same
to come foorth, and submit themselues before him the kings lieutenant, to stand vnto the
kings will and pleasure, or else he would not faile to proc&eacute;ed in execution thereof. The
prouost answered that he would rather abide all extremities, than accomplish his request
and desire in that behalfe; and therevpon returned to the towne.</p>
<p>After the gouernor had heard what answer was made to the prouost, he caused the castell
to be furnished with all things necessarie for defense, and departed straightwaies to Striueling.
The English armie lodging that night in Leith, marched the next day toward Edenburgh,
passing vp the Cannogat str&eacute;et to enter at the nether bow, where they found some resistance
made by the Scots, so that diuerse were slaine on both parts. Towards night, the Englishmen, after they had continued long in skirmishing that day with the Scotishmen, retired
to Leith. The next day the whole armie with the great artillerie came forward towards the
towne, and breaking open the Cannogat, they entred the towne by the same, bringing
<note place="marg">Edenburgh entred by force.</note>
their ordinance within sight of the castell, purposing to plant the same in batterie against
it; but the capteine of the castell caused the artillerie within to shoot off at them in so
great abundance, &amp; so good measure, that they slue diuerse Englishmen, and dismounted
one of their p&eacute;eces, so that in the end they were consireined to draw backe their ordinance
<note place="marg">S&eacute;e more hereof in England.</note>
&amp; retired; but yet in the meane time they set fire on the towne, and burnt the most part
of all the houses in the same. They burnt also the Cannogat street, and the abbeie of
<note place="marg">Edenburgh burnt.</note>

<note place="marg">Prisonets set at libertie.</note>
Holie rood house. The gouernor at that present released out of prison the earle of Angus,
the lord Maxwell, the maister of Glencarne, sir George Dowglas, and others.</p>
<p>In this meane time also there came from the borders by land foure thousand of English
horssemen, vnder the conduction of the lord William Euers, and his sonne sir Rafe Euers;
who ioining with the armie at Leith, scowred the countrie on euerie side of Edenburgh.
Finallie, after the English armie had lien in Leith a certeine space, they burnt that towne
<note place="marg">Leith burnt.</note>
also, and sent their ships awaie fraught with pillage and spoiles (got as well in that towne,
as in Edenburgh, and abroad in the countrie) backe towards England. And therwith the
earle of Hertford, the lord admerall, and others, returned by land through the countrie
vnto Berwike, as in the English historie more at large appeareth. Whilest the English
armie was thus occupied in that part of Scotland, the erle of Lennox with an armie of men
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox.</note>
which he had raised, was readie to come on the backs of the gouernor and his adherents,
if they had assembled their forces and come forward to haue giuen the Englishmen battell.
For all this season the ciuill contentions still continued, and sundrie conflicts and skirmishes
chanced betwixt the parties.</p>

shew some tokens of their inconstancie. For they (which paied y&eacute;erelie tribute in the time
of Iames the fift, kept the peace, liued within the bounds of law, and well obeied the gouernor)
did now (after they saw all things on a flame) begin againe to spoile and destroie their neighbors, in the same vttering the humor of their naturall disposition. Wherevpon the gouernor (to restreine their boldnesse) called vnto him George Gordon earle of Huntleie, and the

earle of Argile, whereof he made the one gouernor of the north parts of Scotland, of
the Orchades, and Shitland; and to the other, he committed the rule of Argile, and the
Iles Hebrides. Wherevpon Huntleie with all sp&eacute;ed gathered an armie from the north parts,
and determined to bridle the Glancamerons, the Gencronelles, the Mudiardes, &amp; the Kindiardes, with force and authoritie. The capteins or heads of which families, were Ewin Allanson, Ronald Mackoneilglas, and Iohn Mudiard, who did possesse the lands of the lords
Grant, and Louet, hauing expelled them by force from the same.</p>
<p>But when they first vnderstood that Huntleie had incamped n&eacute;ere vnto them, they fled
euerie one home to their owne possessions: which being defended partly by the west sea,
and partly included about with the mounteins, stopped Huntleie, so that h&eacute;e might not
haue anie passage vnto them : by meanes whereof (these dissessors being banished) the lords
Grant and Louet were restored to their right inheritance. But it fell out contrarilie for
Louet, who going to take his owne into his hands, fell into danger of his enimies. For
at that time both the companies were disposed into such order, that neither partie could absteine from fight. Wherevpon they first discharge their bodies one against another, and
their arrowes spent, they after flie to their swords, with which they fought so egerlie, that
the night cutting off the battell, it could not be well knowne to which part the victorie
gaue place. In which there was so great slaughter on both parts, that till the next morning
in viewing the dead bodies, the victors were not knowne. Amongest whome of the part
of the Glencamerons and Mudiardes there were manie slaine.</p>
<p>But by reason of the death of the lord Louet, and of his sonne and heire (a youth of sin
gular hope, and brought vp in France) with thr&eacute;e hundred of the bloud and surname of the
Fraisers (for Louet was the head and leader of that familie) the hurt s&eacute;emed to be the greater on their part. For there was a rumor spred, that there was not one of the familie of
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 15.</note>
the Fraisers left aliue that was of mans state. But it happened by the singular benefit
of God, that they left their wiues with child when they went to the fight, by which meanes
the familie was after raised and restored. Huntleie (greatlie grieuing that the Fraisers had
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan</emph> saith that this battell as it was bel&eacute;eued, was procured by Huntleie to destroie the Fraisers.</note>
receiued this grieuous wound) gathered a power togither, and with armes so pursued those
factious people, that he tooke and beheaded Ewin Allanson, and Ronald, with diuerse others,
and put the rest in prison. The earle of Argile discharged the office committed to him
as well as Huntleie did and with more happie successe, for all the IIand men humblie submitted themselues vnto him, and deliuered pledges to liue quietie hereafter.)</p>
<p>About this time the earle of Lennox, accompanied with Alexander the maister of 
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox goeth into England.</note>
Glencarne, otherwise called lord of Kilmawse, Walter Graham brother to the earle of Montrosse,
sir Iohn Borthwike knight, and sundrie other gentlemen, tooke the sea to passe into England, and arriued at Westchester about Midsummer: &amp; passing from thence to the court,
he was ioifullie receiued. And immediatlie therevpon was the mariage celebrated

betwixt him and the ladie Margaret Dowgias, daughter &amp; heire to the earle of Angus, and to

<p>Vpon their arriuall on the coast of Scotland, they burnt the Ile of Arrane, and raced the
gouernors castell there to the ground. And afterwards arriuing at the Ile of Bute, they
<note place="marg">The Ile of Bute taken.</note>
entered the same, and tooke the castell of Roseie standing therein (from whence the Stewards kings of Scotland had their originall) the capteine they had awaie prisoner with them
into England. Here also they tooke two French ships laden with wines, and this doone they
entered the Firth of Clide, thinking to find none but their friends in the castell of Dunbreton. But true it is, that in this meane time the earle of Glencarne with sundrie gentlemen being left in that castell, with the capteine thereof called Houson, to k&eacute;epe it in the
name and to the behoofe of the erle of Lennox, were in his absence persuaded thorough
practise of the queene Dowager, not only to renounce their promised faith to him, in
defrauding him of that castell ; but also to intrap and wind him within their danger to take
him prisoner.</p>
<p>For this purpose they so dissembled the matter, that they had got him on land onelie
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox in danger to be betraied and taken.</note>
with thr&eacute;e hundred men: and so farre foorth they were growne in talke, that the erle of
Lennox being entered into the castell with a few other with him, the monie was laid downe
on the boord, to be paid to the capteine for his satisfaction. But in the meane time,
the earle of Lennox, &amp; such as were with him, perceiuing some treasonable practise in hand,
got foorth of the house againe vnto their companie below, leauing the monie behind them,
and after made shift to get to their ships, and not before it was high time.</p>
<p>For if they had staied that night, they had b&eacute;ene intrapped by George Dowglas, who
with foure thousand men was secretlie drawne thitherwards, and entered the towne of Dunbreton, shortlie after that the earle of Lennox was thus departed, and got to his ships
lieng there at hand in the riuer of Clide, downe the which he retired to the sea, not without danger to haue lost the same ships by reason of the narrownesse of the water: for the
erle of Argile being gotten betwixt him and the sea with a great power of men, with banners displaied, hailsed the ships with shot of ordinance from the castell of Dinnune, annoieng
the earle of Lennox his passage as much as he could. But he escaping with the English gentlemen, and the ships out of danger, tooke aduise togither at the Ile of Bute what
they were best to doo.</p>
<p>The earle sore mooued to haue b&eacute;ene thus repelled from Dunbreton, and stomaching the
matter sore, to be so discountenanced by his enimie the earle of Argile, with the aduise of
the English gentlemen, he returned with them, and with great shew of manhood tooke land
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox landeth at Dinnune.</note>
beside the castell and towne of Dinnune, where the earle of Argile with seuen hundred
men was readie to incounter him, &amp; to k&eacute;epe him off from landing: but by the helpe of
the shot out of the ships, and great store of botes, the Englishmen landed, slue foure score
of the enimies, most part gentlemen, and put the residue to flight, with the losse of thr&eacute;e
men onelie on the English side.</p>
<p>This doone, the towne of Dinnune was burnt, and the church spoiled, that was full of
<note place="marg">The towne of Dinnune burnt.</note>
goods and ornaments. When the night approched, by reason the Englishmen had no powder, nor other prouision on land, the earle with his people returned to shipboord in safetie,
howbeit not without offer of skirmish made by the enimies though to their losse, namelie of those that aduanced themselues most forward. About foure or fiue daies after, the
earle of Lennox with fiue hundred men landed in another part of Argile, and remaining
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox landeth againe in Argile.</note>
on land a whole day togither, burnt, spoiled, and wasted the countrie: the earle of Argile with two thousand men giuing the looking on, and not once offering the skirmish, so that
the earle of Lennox with his souldiers retired to his ships without incounter.</p>
<p>After this they inuaded the Ile of Kinter, where Iames Mackonell dwelled, burnt manie
<note place="marg">Kinter inuaded.</note>
places in that countrie, tooke and caried awaie great booties of cattell and other goods. All
the coasts of Kile, Carrike, &amp; Coningham, and likewise of Galloway remained in continuall
feare, so that oftentimes their beacons were fired, and manie of the noble men constrained
to come to the earle of Lennox, suing to him for assurance. In these exploites the earle
had with him Walter Macferlane of Tirbat, and seuen score men of the head of Lennox,

that spake both Irish, English, &amp; the Scotish toongs, light footmen, well armed in shirts of
male, with bowes, and two handed swords, and being ioined with the English archers and
shot, did much auailable seruice in the streicts, the marishes, and mountaine countries.</p>
<p>* During these things, they which had gouernment of Scotish affairs (as the qu&eacute;ene Dowager,
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan li.</emph> 15.</note>
the cardinall, and the gouernor) called a councell, in which they decr&eacute;ed that all such of the
nobilitie as had force and armor, should be readie to follow the gouernor whither soeuer he
went, and there to remaine with him for the space of eight daies. Shortlie after there assembled eight thousand men, and in the sharpe winter battered the church of Coldingham,
standing in armor a whole day and night to the great toile and wearinesse of the men and
horsses. The next day the gouernor, either to accuse his tendernesse susteined in the last
daies labor of warre, or else fearing the inuasion of the enimie (for he was certified of an
armie of men that should come from Berwike) suddenlie (vnknowne to the other nobilitie)
did flie to Dunbar with a few of his owne traine. They which went about to excuse the
defame of this flight, reported how he feared that he should haue b&eacute;ene betraied to the
English by his host, for hatred which they had conceiued against him for manie of his offenses.</p>
<p>This departure of the gouernor brought great trouble to the armie, &amp; so much the more, bicause the secreter it was (and the reason vnknowne) the more cause it gaue to the rest to feare
some further euill. Wherefore the greater part remained in this obstinate mind, that euerie
one should returne the next way home, and leaue the artillerie at randon. But others
(who were more carefull, and would s&eacute;eme lesse fearefull) doo agr&eacute;e to stuffe the p&eacute;eces
full of powder, and to breake them, rather than they should fall in the hands &amp; helpe of
the enimie. To the which deuise onelie Archembald Dowglas did resist, least he should ad
a wicked d&eacute;ed to a wicked flight. Who when he could not staie any man, either by threat,
intreatie, or authoritie, he exclamed with a lowd voice (for euerie one to heare him) that
for his owne part he had rather die an honest death, than to haue a secure and rich life with
such dishonor. "Wherefore you my friends consider what you will doo, for either I will
bring awaie this artillerie, or I will not returne home with life ; wherefore I meane to make
this the last end both of my life and glorie." When he had spoken this, a few (whose honor was deare vnto them) were mooued therewith, but the rest (despairing by reason of the
shamefull flight of the gouernor) did scatteringlie depart wandring whither they thought good,
without anie order. The Dowgiasse with such companie as he had (placed in good order)
followed the artillerie, and brought the same to Dunbar, the horesemen of his enimies in vaine
hastening after them behind at their backes. This expedition by the gouernor rashlie begun, and shamefullie performed, brake the hearts of the Scots, and aduanced the minds of
the English, who gloriouslie applied the dastardnesse of the gouernor to their owne glorie.)</p>
<p>To conclude, after the earle of Lennox and his companie had atchiued these enterprises
afore mentioned, he returned towards England, and sent sir Peter Mewtas knight, &amp; Thomas
<note place="marg">Sir Peter Mewtas.</note>
Bishop a Scotish gentleman, to aduertise the king of England of his proc&eacute;edings, who found
him at the siege of Bullongne, where they declared to him the whole circumstance of euerie
thing, as the same had passed in the earles iornie, which the king tooke in verie good
part. And vpon his returne into England, after the conquest of Bullongne, the earle of
Lennox was also called home to the court by letters to him directed, he being then at
Bristow.</p>
<p>About the middest of Februarie, sir Rafe Eure commonlie called Euers, lord warden of

<note place="marg">Sir Rafe Euers inuadeth Scotland.</note>
the English middle marches, entred Scotland with a power of foure thousand Englishmen,
Irishmen, and assured Scots; and comming first vnto Iedwoorth, lodged there that night.
And therewithall vnderstanding that the gouernor and the earle of Angus were at the abbeie
of Melros, about eight miles distant from thence, the next morning he was got foorth so
earlie, that he was almost vpon the enimies in such wise on the sudden, that they fled out
of their lodgings, and left their beds and all their houshold furniture which they had in store
there with them, not hauing time to conueie it awaie at their departure, their warning was

so short. Sir Rafe Euers at his comming thither, finding them fled and gome, spoiled the
<note place="marg">He defaceth the monuments of the Dowglasses.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buch. lib.</emph> 15.</note>
towne and abbeie, vtterlie defacing the toomes and monuments of the earles of Dowglas,
greatlie to the displeasure of the earle of Angus, and those of his linage.</p>
<p>* After this (the comming of the English being looked for the next y&eacute;ere) the minds of
the borderers were greatlie troubled, bicause they were hopelesse to atteine anie succor from
the gouernor, which vsed the aduise of the clergie, but chieflie of the cardinall. Wherevpon
Archembald Dowglas earle of Angus (greatlie mooued partlie with his priuat losses, for he
had great possessions in the marches, and in Tiuiot, and partlie to s&eacute;e his ancestors monuments defaced) came to the gouernor, and fullie laid before him the greatnesse of the danger wherein the realme did stand, persuading him to incounter and resist the same. At
what time also (after the gouernour had opened vnto him, that he was forsaken of the nobilitie, and now left alone) the Dowglas shewed that the same happened vnto him by his owne
fault, and not by the nobilitie, which would imploie their liues, liuings, and goods, for the
defense of the common-wealth. For he contemning their counsell, onelie leaned to the spiritualtie, who were cowards in warre, and seditious in peace.</p>
<p>"Out of this founteine (saith he) a suspicion (that you dare not trust one another) is
growne betw&eacute;ene you and them, which is the onelie cause why things are not better performed. But if you determine (in great affaires) to take the aduise of them (who will not
refuse to spend their bloud therein) I doubt not but that we shall be able to execute as great matters as euer our ancestors did: but if we shall (by our slouth) permit the enimie to take all
things from vs, then of necessitie will folow, that either they shall shortli&eacute; banish vs, or
bring vs into perpetuall seruitude: the inconueniences of anie of which cannot well be
spoken. As touching our selues I know that thou art suspected to be a coward, and I a
traitor, which reproch if thou thinke to purge (for thou canst not auoid it) prepare to cleare
the same, not with painted speaches, but with bloudie weapons.")</p>
<p>Wherevpon the gouernor and the said earle (sore aggreeued to be thus toiled at the Englishmens hands) assembled togither [vnder the leading of Norman Lesle son of the earle
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
of Rothseie] all such forces as they might recouer, so that they had quicklie got them about
fifteene hundred men, wherof eight hundred at the least were gentlemen. Who hearing
that the Englishmen were retiring towards ledworth, they met them at a place called Pannier hugh, or Broomehouse, where both the parties alighting on foot, ment to trie the quarell by plaine force of hand. But as they were redy to ioine, the assured Scots, to the number of seuen or eight hundred reuolted vnto the part of their countrmen, by reason whereof,
after a right sharpe and fierce conflict, the Englishmen in the end were constreined to flie,

whome the Scots right egerlie pursued, slue sir Rafe Euers, the lord Ogle, sir Brian Leiton,
and other gentlemen &amp; souldiors to the number of eight hundred. They tooke also about
two thousand prisoners, with certeine p&eacute;eces of artillerie and other munition.</p>
<p>This victorie fell to the Scots the seuent&eacute;enth day of Februarie, the report whereof was
right displeasant to the English nation, but speciallie the losse of that worthie gentleman
sir Rafe Euers was greatlie bemoned, and that euen of the king himselfe, for the noble
nrowesse and great Ioialtie which at all times had b&eacute;ene found in him. His seruice had
<note place="marg">His seruice against the Scots.</note>
beene such in these wars against Scotland, that he had brought the more part of the Scots
within twentie miles space of the English borders, vnto the obeisance of the king of England,
although at length they holpe to worke his confusion, as before ye haue heard. &para; Of this
<note place="marg"><emph>Abr. Fl.</emph></note>
gentleman &amp; his singular seruice in the field, I omit here to speake, bicause he was imploied
otherwise, besides Scotland: wherefore I remit the readers to the twentith yere of king
Henrie the eight, where to his high commendation this gentleman is recorded.]</p>
<p>* The occasion of the English ouerthrow (as saith Lesleus) and the Scots victorie, were
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 102. <emph>pag.</emph> 478.</note>
chieflie by these meanes. First they fought vpon equall ground, and with vnequall helpes.
For the Scots with the sunne on their backs (being declined toward setting) came foorth of a
narrow &amp; marish place, and set vpon the English (at the side of an hill which was betweene
them) hauing the sun in their faces, by which meanes they could neither well perceiue what

number the Scots had, nor with their gunnes hurt anie of the Scots. But those that fought
in the first battell, wherevnto was ioined (a feare not in vaine) which they had conceiued of
the Scotish march-men, who in great number hauing red crosses (the note of the English)
ran vp and downe hither and thither to s&eacute;e the euent thereof.)</p>
<p>About the same time that the victorie before mentioned chanced to the Scots, Robert
Corncorse bishop of Rosse departed this life, to whome succ&eacute;eded Dauid Pantane, 
<note place="marg">Death of bishops.</note>
secretarie to the gouernor and prior of saint Marie lle. In Aprill, William Steward bishop of
Aberden likewise deceassed, and maister William Gordon chancellor of Murreie, vncle to
George erle of Huntleie, was by the cardinals sute promoted to that s&eacute;e, greatlie to the
displeasure of the earle of Angus, that labored to haue preferred an other thereto. For this
and other causes, the cardinall was greatlie in hatred of the Dowglasses.</p>
<p>* About that time, the king of England by prise &amp; preies persuaded the Flemings to
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 479.</note>
take sixteene of our ships harbored in the hauen, and to conuert the commodities (wherewith they were fraught, being verie costlie) to their owne commoditie. By means whereof
at one time we had warres with two nations, England and Flanders. But sith the Flemings did not the same maliciously for hatred to the Scots, but carefullie for the loue
vnto the English, as the Scots did certeinlie know, they shewed none other token of enimitie
to the Flemings, but that they forbad them to fish on their coasts, and did sometime intercept their ships, without further iniurie doone vnto them.)</p>
<p>This y&eacute;ere also, Montgomerie, otherwise called monsieur de Lorges, knight of the order
<note place="marg">1545. <emph>Buch.</emph></note>

<note place="marg">Monsieur de Lorges sent into Scotland.</note>
of saint Michaell, was sent by the French king with foure thousand Frenchmen into Scotland to assist the Scots against England. He landed at Dunbreton, &amp; came in good order to Edenburgh the thirt&eacute;enth of Maie: he brought with him from the French king the
order of saint Michaell, to inuest therewith the lord gouernor, the earles of Angus, 
<note place="marg">Knights of saint Michaels order.</note>

<note place="marg">An armie of Scots lieth on the borders.</note>
Huntleie, and Argile. Herwith also was an armie of Scots raised, and ioining with the Frenchmen, they approched the borders, where they laie for a season: but the earle of Hertford
lieutenant generall of the north parts comming downe, tooke such direction for the safe
k&eacute;eping of the English borders, that after the Scots had laine there in campe a certeine space
without atchiuing anie great enterprise, though some notable exploit was looked for to haue
beene attempted by them at that present, they brake vp their armie &amp; went home.</p>
<p>* This castell of Dunbreton was at that time so carefullie kept by the captein therof, that he
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 480.</note>
determined neither to deliuer it to the gouernor, nor to anie Englishman, nor to anie Scot.
Wherevpon, the gouernor fearing least it should fall into the hands of the English, prepare to
besiege the same; the newes wherof comming to Glencarne, he signified the same vnto Lennox, affirming, that if he would come thither, he should shortlie obteine the castell. The king
of England reioising of that newes, prepareth two ships, and in the meane time sent the
bishop of Cathnesse into Scotland, which should foorthwith be receiued into the castell.
Wherefore the gouernor making the more hast, commeth to Dunbreton togither with the
cardinall, and the earles Huntleie, and Argile, laieng present siege to the same, which was
stronglie doone, and the castilains pressed to great extremitie by the slaughter of manie people. But at length by the policie of the earle Huntleie, it was so agr&eacute;ed, that the castell
(which was by nature inexpugnable) should be deliuered. Which the gouernor receiued
(with certeine conditions) and honorablie intreated the capteine for the singular discharge of
the trust committed to him: and therewithall he restored the bishop of Cathnesse, brother
to the earle of Lennox to his bishoprike, which before he had lost by his going into England.)</p>
<p>The sixteenth of September, thr&eacute;e or foure hundred Scots, with Maxwell, Lochinuart,
and Iohnstone, aided with the Frenchmen, attempted to enter into England on the east
borders: but the Englishmen perceiuing where they were about to passe by a certeine
<note place="marg">Frenchmen and Scots ouerthrowne.</note>
streit, they set vpon them with their archers, discomfited them, sleaing, &amp; taking to the
number of seuen score of them. Among other that were taken, one of the sonnes to the
lord Hume, with a French capteine, and George Elphinston archer of the corps to the French

king, were accounted chiefe. Also on the west borders, Robert Maxwell eldest son to the
<note place="marg">The lord Maxwels son taken prisoner.</note>
lord Maxwell, was taken in a rode made by him and others, into the English confines on
that side; although at an other time certeine Englishmen making a rode into Scotland
were distressed, the more part of them being taken or slaine. At a parlement holden at
Linlithquho, begun there the twentie eight of September, and continued till the first of October, Matthew earle of Lennox, and Thomas bishop of Vtheltree, were forfalted, and all their
lands and goods giuen awaie and annexed to the crowne.</p>
<p>In this meane time, the king of England desirous to haue the seruice of the Iles of Scotland for sundrie great causes and respects, mooued the earle Lennox to deale with them
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox procureth them of the Iles to serue the king of England.</note>
to that end : which he did. And his trauell tooke such effect, that the Iland men were contented to rest at the king of England his deuotion, partlie for that they were in a manner
sworne enimies to the earle of Argile, and his familie; and partlie for that they doubted the
king of Englands puissance, if he should attempt to inuade those parties: and againe, bearing an old speciall fauour to the earle of Lennox and his house, hauing an ancient bond
of aliance and amitie with the same, they were the more readie to satisfie his motion. H&eacute;
<note place="marg">The lord of the Iles elected, being one of the Maconels.</note>
erevpon, they elected amongest them a lord of the Iles, the next of bloud: a title long since
verie odious to the state of Scotland, and by the inducement of the earle of Lennox, he was
contented as the king of Englands pensioner, to receiue two thousand crownes of him
y&eacute;erelie, with certeine rich apparell of cloth of gold and siluer from the said earle.</p>
<p>The first proofe he attempted to shew of his seruice in the king of Englands behalfe, was
this. Hauing instructions thereto from the earle of Lennox, vnder colour of conference for
matters touching the estate of the countrie, he had suborned one of his aliance and seruants,
called the clane Reginald, to intrappe the earles of Argile and Huntleie. And although
<note place="marg">Clane Reginald sleieth the lord Louet.</note>
they escaped verie narrowlie, the lord Louet an ancient baron &amp; great friend to those two
earles, was slaine by the said clane, togither with seuen hundred of his kinsmen and friends:
insomuch that there remained not but one yoong boy of that linage to succ&eacute;ed in that lords
lands [which is before more fullie handeled out of Lesleus.]</p>
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
<p>After this, the lord of the lles, with six thousand men imbarked in certeine vessels, 
<note place="marg">The lord of the Iles inuadeth Carike.</note>
passed ouer into Carrike, harried and burnt the lands of the earie of Cassiles, then a great enimie to the king of England. In this voiage he got great spoiles, and slue manie of the
enimies. After which enterprise so atchiued, he came with his power by sea, and landed
<note place="marg">He commeth into Ireland.</note>
in Ireland, where the earles of Lennox and Ormond were, with twelue hundred Irishmen,
appointed to ioine with him, that with their whole power they might inuade the earle of Argiles countries, &amp; consequentlie the maine land of Scotland at the broad side. But before
the preparation could be made readie for that iorneie, the new lord of the Iles deceassed,
<note place="marg">He departeth this life.</note>
whose buriall in Ireland to honor the earle of Lennox, stood the king of England in foure
hundred pounds sterling.</p>
<p>But now to returne vnto the dooings on the borders betwixt England and Scotland in this
season. Ye shall vnderstand, that after the armie of Scotland was broken vp, the earle of
Hertford by vertue of his commission, raised an armie in the countries of the further side of
Trent northwards; so that when the same was assembled togither, with such strangers as
were then in the kings wages, they were in all of horssemen and footmen twelue 
<note place="marg">But eight thousand, as some say.</note>

<note place="marg">The earle of Hertford inuadeth Scotland.</note>
thousand fighting men. With this armie garded with great store of artillerie, munition, and
all manner of furniture necessarie, the earle of Hertford entered Scotland, and marching
to Coldingham, past vp by the water of Tw&eacute;ed, and burnt a great part of the Mers, and
Tiuidale, the abbeies of Kelso, Melrosse, Driborne, and Iedworth, with townes &amp; villages,
to the number of fiue score.</p>
<p>Howbeit, he entered not farre within the said countrie beyond the said water, but kept
alongest n&eacute;ere to the same, and returned backe without anie incounter: for after the Scotish armie was broken vp, it was not like they would assemble againe, and so the earle of
Hertford taking the time that serued his purpose, sore indamaged the Scotish borders at
that present. Manie other small inuasions were made, as well by the one part as the

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"other,"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"544"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

other, and some skirmishes fell out betwixt them, sometime to the losse of the Scotish,
and sometime of the English, according to the course of warre.</p>
<p>* Much about this time, or rather before, Robert Maxwell the sonne of Robert (a yoong
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 15.</note>
man of singular vertue) was taken by the English. Besides which there was nothing doone
woorthie the memorie, but that in the beginning of the next winter Montgomerie returned
into France. After this,the cardinall leadeth the gouernor about the n&eacute;ere countries, vnder
colour to reconcile such parts as were at dissention: then they came first to Perth, where
foure men were punished for eating flesh on forbidden daies: from thence they went to
Dund&eacute;e called Toadune (to vse the name of the place, as Buchanan hath) to punish (as they
said) such as vsed the late new testament of Luthers translation. Thither came also Patrike
Greie (the head of a noble familie in those parts) accompanied with a good traine, togither
with the erle of Rothseie, being before that commanded to be there by the gouernor, after
the pacifieng of the other tumults. But the cardinall (supposing it small safetie to receiue
at one time two such noble and factious persons addicted to the restored religion, into the
towne) wrought with the gouernor that he and they might go backe to Perth.</p>
<p>The next morning, when those two noblemen (redie for the iourneie) vnderstood that
the gouernor was on his waie towards Perth, they presentlie followed him. Who being
come in sight, did strike such feare into the cardinall, that the gouernor commanded them
to sunder themselues, and seuerallie to enter the citie: which they did. Wherevpon the
next day they were both committed to prison. But Rothseie being shortlie deliuered, Greie
(whome they hated more, and feared most) was kept longer in that restraint. But before
they parted thence, it s&eacute;emed good to the cardinall to abate the strength of Ruthwen capteine
of the towne. For which cause, the gouernor taketh his office from him, and bestoweth
the same vpon Kinfane Comarch, neighbor and kinsman to Greie. For this Ruthwen was
a great enimie to the cardinall, and much fauored the restored religion: as likewise was
Greie, who after the same sort did not beare a friendlie mind to the cardinall, nor to his
religion.</p>
<p>By reason whereof, the cardinall supposed, that if he might set them (by this meanes)
together by the eares (sith manie of both parts would ioine for defense of the chiefe of
their families) and that if anie side had the woorse (as both must be diminished) that
then he had by so much abated the power of one of his enimies. Vpon which occasion the
gouernement of Perth (which had by manie descents remained in the familie of the Ruthwens) might be thus translated to Kinfane. Thus the new capteine was sent with a power
to subdue the citizens by force, if they would not willinglie obeie: as it s&eacute;emed that they
would not; because they tooke it with some griefe, to haue (in this new capteine) the old
libertie of voices (in choosing of their gouernor) taken from them. The besieging of the
towne being therefore diuided into parts, Greie (which had wholie taken the matter on him)
attempted the ouerthrow thereof, from the bridge of Taie. The other band (hauing laid
their artillerie along by the riuer ouer against the towne) did inuade the open side of the said
Perth.</p>
<p>But because the swelling of the sea did not answer their deuise, they came not in time to
doo anie thing therein. Greie assalting it by the bridge (which Ruthwen hauing receiued,

no armed men stirring, did (without all feare) enter further into the towne, where he was
so sharplie set vpon by Ruthwen, and his companie (suddenlie and vnlooked for breaking
out of the houses vpon them) that euerie one hastened to spie some place by which he might
flie awaie. But the multitude confused and driuen into a streict, did let one an other
thereof. For they behind, thinking to breake in amongest the other, did hinder the first
that they could not flie: in which vnorderlie multitude, manie were troden vnder foot, and
thr&eacute;e score were killed with the sword.</p>
<p>The cardinall (although against his mind) hauing heard of the victorie of Ruthwen; yet
he did not greatlie lament the slaughter made of his aduersaries. After this, the cardinall

hauing thus suficientlie progressed to Angus: he led the gouernor after the fouret&eacute;enth of
December to saint Andrews, to the end (if it were possible) to bind the gouernor more
firmelie vnto him. For although before he had the gouernors sonne as pledge with him;
yet (as often as he remembred the eagernesse of the Scotish nobilitie, the strength of his
enimies, and the inconstancie of the gouernor) he greatlie feared, least the said gouernor
should with like lightnesse be drawen to assist his enimies, as he had b&eacute;ene led to take his
part.] During the time whilest they were at S. Andrews, the cardinall caused in the Lent
season all the bishops &amp; prelats of the realme to assemble at the towne of saint Andrews,
where a learned man, named maister George Wischart, that had be&eacute;ne in the schooles of
Germanie, was accused of heresie, which he had (as was alleged against him) publikelie
preached, and priuatlie taught in Dund&eacute;e, Brechin, and diuerse other parts of Scotland, since
<note place="marg">George Wischart a learned man burnt.</note>
his returne home. This matter was so vrged against him, that he was conuict, and burnt
there in the towne of saint Andrews during the time of that conuention or assemblie.</p>
<p>* When these things were thus doone, the cardinall, although he greatlie trusted to his
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 15.</note>
riches; yet because he was not ignorant what were the minds of men, &amp; what sp&eacute;eches the
common people had of him) determined to increase his power with new deuises. Wherefore he goeth into Angus, and marieth his eldest daughter (as saith Buchanan) to the earle
of Crawfords sonne. Which mariage was solemnized with great preparation, almost answerable to kinglie magnificence. During which time, the cardinall vnderstanding by his
spies, that the English did prepare to inuade the Scotish borders on the sea (and speciallie
did threaten those of Fife therewith) returned to saint Andrews, and appointed a day to the
nobilitie, and such as dwelied about the sea coasts, to assemble togither to prouide in common for the defense thereof, and to prepare remedie for that hastened euill. For the easier
and better performance whereof, he had determined, togither with the lords of that countrie,
to haue sailed himselfe about the coasts, and to haue defended such places as were most
conuenient.</p>
<p>Amongest others that came vnto him, there was a noble yoong gentlemen called Norman
Lesle, sonne to the earle of Rothseie, whereof we haue spoken before manie times. This
man (after that he had manie times emploied his valiant and faithfull diligence in the behalfe
of the cardinall) grew to some contention with the said cardinall for a priuat cause, which
for a time did estrange both their minds the one from the other. This same contention did
Norman (being thereto induced with manie faire promises) afterwards let fall. But certeine
moneths following (when he returned to demand the performance of such liberall promises)
they began to grow from common sp&eacute;ech to brallings, and from thence to bitter tawnts &amp;
reproches, not fit to be vsed by anie of them both. Wherevpon they departed with the
gr&eacute;eued minds of euerie of them. For the cardinall being intreated more vnreuerentlie
than he would or looked for; and the other threatning that being ouertaken by deceipt,
he would reuenge it: they both returned discontented to their owne people. Wherevpon
Norman, declaring to his partakers the intollerable arrogancie of the cardinall, they easilie
agr&eacute;ed all to conspire his death. Wherefore, to the end that the same might be lesse
suspected, they departed in sunder afterward. This Norman accompanied onelie with flue
of his owne traine, entred the towne of saint Andrews, and went into his accustomed Inne
and lodging; trusting that by such small traine he might cunninglie dissemble the determination of the cardinals death. But there were in that towne, ten of those which had
consented to this conspiracie; which closed in secret corners, some in one place, and some
in an other, did onelie expect the signe which was to be giuen vnto them to execute this
deuise. With which small companie this Norman feared not to aduenture the death of the
cardinall in the same towne, furnished in euerie place with the seruants and friends of the
cardinall.]</p>
<p>Wherevpon the thirt&eacute;enth of Maie, the cardinall being within his castell of saint Andrews,
certeine of his owne friends (as he tooke them) that is to say, the said Norman, lord
Lesleie, William Kirkandie, the yoong lord of Grange, and Kirkmichell with sixteene

chosen men, entered the castell verie secretlie in the morning, tooke the porter, and all the
cardinals seruants, thrusting them out of the place by a posterne gate. And that doone, passing to his chamber where he laie in bed, as he got vp, and was opening his chamber doore,
they slue him, and seized vpon the artillerie and munition, wherewith that fortresse was
<note place="marg">The cardinall of saint Andrews marthered.</note>
plentifullie furnished, and likewise with rich hangings, houshold stuffe of all sorts, apparell,
copes, iewels, ornaments of churches, great store of gold and siluer plate, beside no small
quantitie of treasure in readie coine.</p>
<p>Sir Iames Leirmouth, prouost of saint Andrews, assembled all the people of that towne
for the rescue of the cardinall, after he heard that the conspirators were entred the castell;
but they shewed the d&egrave;ad bodie of the cardinall ouer the wals, as a spectacle to the people,
and so they made no further attempt, sith they saw no meane how to remedie or reuenge
the matter at that present. The cause that mooued the conspirators thus to kill the cardinall,
was thought to be partlie in reuenge of the burning of maister George Wischart, fearing
to be serued with the same sawce, and in the end to be made to drinke of the same cup. Partlie
it was thought they attempted it through counsell of some great men of the realme, that
had conceiued some deadlie hatred against him.</p>
<p>*But Lesleus also, writing of the causes of his death saith, that they were diuerse: as
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 481.</note>
the seuerall tormentors seuerallie framed euerie one a part for his owne excuse. For Norman &amp; Iohn did complaine, that they were wronged by him with no small iniurie, because
that the cardinall had not recompensed him for the losse he susteined; when the cardinall
had restored to Colwine lord thereof (before through the cardinals counsell banished by the
king) the castell and possessions of Easter wemes; which the king had after giuen to the
said Norman. The lord Grange affirmed that he reuenged himselfe, because he was remooued by the cardinals aduise from the office of the treasurorship; which (being granted
by the king to him) he had discharged with great profit to the realme, &amp; honor to himselfe.
And Kirkmichell did also say that he was dispossessed by the cardinall of some other (I cannot tell what) possessions. All which causes were but veiles which they spread against the
wind and report of so wicked and shamefull a deed. For vpon the fact, Norman being
vexed with remorse of conscience, did not onelie labor to pacifie the anger of such, that
(either by bloud or benefit) were tied to the cardinall with all kind of duties: but did also,
to shun the danger thereof, passe into France, and there by valour (in the seruice of Henrie
the second king of France) endeuored to wipe away that note of infamie, which he had
cast vpon his familie. All which notwithstanding, both he and others (some after one sort,
and some after an other) were worthilie punished for their wickednes.]</p>
<p>The same euening that the cardinall was slaine, the old lord of Grange, maister Henrie
Balnauis, one of the councell of the realme, and sundrie gentlemen of the surname of the
Meluins, Iohn Knocts and others, to the number of seuen score persons, entred the castell
to their support, taking vpon them to keepe it against the gouernor and his partakers. Not
long after, the gouernor, considering that his deere cousine the cardinall was thus made

awaie, assembled the great lords of the realme, as the earle of Angus, Huntleie, Argile, and
others, by whose aduise he called a parlement, and forfalted them that had slaine the cardinall, and kept the castell of saint Andrews.</p>
<p>Herewith also he raised a power, and besieged the same castell, planting diuerse p&eacute;eces
of great artillerie against it. But it was so stronglie furnished with all maner of artillerie &amp;
munition by the cardinall in his life time, that they within cared little for all the inforcements that their aduersaries without could aduance against them. Wherevpon, after that
the siege had continued the space of thr&eacute;e moneths, the gouernor was glad to take an appointment with them within, to the end he might get out of their hands his eldest sonne,
who was remaining with the cardinall at the time when he was murthered, and so kept by
them that did the murther, till now they agr&eacute;ed to deliuer him to his father, with condition
that he should raise his siege.</p>

<note place="marg">The king of England deceassed.</note>

<note place="marg">The death of the French king.</note>
great troubles in the realme.] In the yeare next insuing, king Henrie the eight departed
this life, after whome succ&eacute;eded his sonne Edward, the sixt of that name, king of England,
France, and Ireland. Shortlie after, that is to say, the last of March, Francis the French
king deceassed, and his sonne Henrie, the second of that name, succeeded him; who at the
desire of the gouernor of Scotland, appointed Leone Strossie prior of Capoa, a knight of the
order of Malta, with a nauie of 16 gallies, fraught with men of warre, and munition, to
passe into Scotland, to helpe to win the castell of saint Andrews.</p>
<p>The gouernor in the meane time with an armie passed to the west borders to besiege the
castell of Langham, the which was kept at that present by Michaell Wharton, hauing then
with him but sixteene Englishmen, who neuerthelesse abid thr&eacute;e or foure daies siege, and
seuen canon shots, and so y&eacute;elded the house to the gouernor: and hereby was the peace
broken, first by the Scots, euen as the Englishmen could haue wished. Moreouer, at the
same time, the erle of Rothous then returned out of Denmarke was acquit by an assise (as
they call it) of earles and lords, of an accusation wherewith he was charged, as confederat
and partie with them that had murthered the cardinall.</p>
<p>Whilest the gouernor was thus passed with his armie to the west borders, he was aduertised that the prior of Capoa was arriued, and [against the wils of such as were against it]
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg">The castell of saint Andrews besieged by the French.</note>
entred into the towne of saint Andrews: wherevpon the gouernor, with all the nobilitie that
were then about him, hasted thither to assist the prior, and so the siege was stronglie laid
about the castell there. The prior caused certeine p&eacute;eces of artillerie to be drawen vp,
and mounted on the top of a church, which was higher than the castell; so that those peeces
shot plump into the castell, that none durst shew themselues on the wals, or abroad in the
yard within the castell. He caused also certeine canons to be drawen with engins, n&eacute;ere
to the verie wals of the castell, which battered the same in such sort, as the ditches were
n&eacute;ere hand filled with the rubbish and stones of the wals that fell downe.</p>
<p>Moreouer, the gallies at an high water approched on the riuer side so neere to the castell,
that with shot of canons and other arillerie, they sore annoied them within, and slue diuerse. The defendants perceiuing themselues thus besieged on all sides, &amp; not able long to
hold out, put foorth a token vpon a speares point, to signifie that they desired parlee, which
was granted, and certeine of them comming foorth, were admitted to talke with the gouernor, the qu&eacute;ene, and the prior of Capoa.They offered to render the castell, so they
might depart, and haue their liues saued with bag and baggage.</p>
<p>But this would not be granted, the gouernor vtterlie refusing it; at length he was 
<note place="marg">The castell of S. Andrews yeelded.</note>
content to pardon them of their liues, if the French king should thinke it good, else to stand
to his pleasure. The spoile of the castell was giuen to the Frenchmen, who vpon the surrender entring the same, left nothing behind him* that might serue them to anie vse in
<note place="marg">[* <emph>Sic.</emph></note>
taking it away. All the principall men within it were led to the gallies, and conueied awaie
into France prisoners at the French kings discretion. Diuerse of them were committed to
sundrie prisons on the coast of Britaine, and others were appointed to row in the gallies till
the yeare 1550, in which the prisoners we* set at libertie, and the others that were in the
gallies were redeemed by their friends for certeine summes of monie.</p>
<p>Thus was the castell of saint Andrews rendred the nine and twentith of Iulie, fourt&eacute;ene
daies after the arriuall there of the prior of Capoa, whereby his great valiancie, well knowen
<note place="marg">The prior Capoa.</note>

therein was much aduanced. Shortlie after, the duke of Summerset, heretofore in this

minding the aduancement of the yoong king his nephue, thought good with all sp&eacute;ed to
procure the consummation of the mariage, betwixt him, and the yoong qu&eacute;ene of Scots.</p>
<p>But perceiuing that the same could not be brought to passe without force, he s&eacute;emed
loth to let passe the opportunitie of time then offered (as he tooke it) to serue his purpose;
and therevpon by aduise of councell leuied an armie with all expedition, and came to Berwike,
about the latter end of August, and in the beginning of September entred Scotland with the
<note place="marg">He entreth Scotland with an armie.</note>
same armie, conteining seauent&eacute;ene or eighteene thousand men, which was diuided into
three principall wards, the vant-gard led by the valiant earle of Warwike, the battell by
the duke of Summerset himselfe, and the rere-ward by the lord Dacres of the north.</p>
<p>There were certeine wings and troopes of men of armes, demilances, and light 
<note place="marg">The order of the English armie.</note>
horssemen, and also of harquebusiers, that attended vpon these thr&eacute;e wards, garded with diuerse
p&eacute;eces of great artillerie. The lord Greie of Wilton high marshall of the armie had the
generall conduction of the men of armes and demilances. Sir Francis Brian, lieutenant of
the light horssemen, with eight hundred of them was appointed to the vant-gard. Sir Peter
Mewtas capteine of fiue hundred hagbutters, and sir Francis Fleming maister of the ordinance, with a thousand light horssemen, were appointed to the battell. And sir Richard
Manners, with six hundred light horssemen, attended vpon the rere-ward.</p>
<p>In this order marching through the Mers, and Louthian, they came at length vnto a
place called Buckling Braies, neere to the Forth side, in which riuer the English fleet was
<note place="marg">The English fl&eacute;et.</note>
arriued, and laie before the towne of Leith, but now by order giuen came backe from
thence, and lay n&eacute;erer to the armie. The gouernor of Scotland aduertised of the comming
of this armie of England thus to inuade Scotland, with all diligence sent abroad solemne
<note place="marg">The gouernor raiseth an armie.</note>
summons for the leuieng of a new armie foorth of all parts of the realme; supposing thereby
to be sufficientlie furnished and inabled for the incounter; happen when it should; the contrarie part (no doubt) being likewise opinioned, and both hoping, or greedilie gaping after
the glorie of victorie.</p>
<p>*For the gouernor did attempt at this time that which is accustomed to be vsed in the
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 485.</note>
greatest dangers of the countrie: which was, that he sent out messengers through all the
realme, who carieng a fierie crosse in their hands, should make signe (and declare) aswell
to the laitie, as to the churchmen; that all they which were aboue sixteene yeares old, and
vnder sixtie, should presentlie (with their armor) repaire to Mussilborow, and there be readie
to defend the libertie of the countrie; who accordinglie came to Mussilborow (within lesse
than two miles of the place where the English armie came to incampe, lieng at Preston) &amp;
placed themselues at Inuernesse ouer against their enimies.]</p>
<p>Here we haue to vnderstand, that the Scots light horssemen oftentimes would come pricking almost within their staues length of the Englishmen as they marched, whouping and
shouting, to the end they might traine them foorth from their strength, and with railing
words would still be in hand to prouoke them thereto. But the duke of Summerset,
doubting the goodnesse of the Scotish prickers, gaue secret commandement, that no offer

of skirmish by the Scotish horsmen should be taken. But at length the lord Greie of Wilton, not able to beare such bold presumption in the Scots, aduenturing (as he tooke it) ouer
rashlie, and more than stood with their owne suertie, made sute to the duke of Summerset,
that if they continued in such brauerie, it might be lawfull for him to set them further off.</p>
<p>The duke at the first by no meanes would assent thereto, telling the lord Greie, that his
desire proceeded more of a iolitie of courage, than of anie knowledge of the enimie, and
s&eacute;emed to defend the goodnesse of the Scotish horssemen: but when the lord Greie persisted
in his sute, and the earle of Warwike assisted his request, the duke in the end y&eacute;elded
thereto. Herevpon when the lord Hume with the Scots the next time (which was on the
Fridaie the ninth of September) came foorth to offer the skirmish after their woonted
maner, the lord Greie taking with him certeine bands of horssemen, both men of armes,
demilances, and also light horsmen, diuided them in troopes, appointing the Spanish and

of the English horssemen.</p>
<p>He also gaue order to the leaders of euerie troope, that to which soeuer the enimie should
once offer, in anie wise, that no answer by skirmish were made them, but after they had
<note place="marg">Order giuen by the lord Greie.</note>
drawne them to their accustomed plaie and proffer of charge, that troope that it was offered
vnto, presentlie vpon the enimies wheeling about should throughlie giue it them; and that
so giuen, the next troope presentlie to giue it in the face: and so (as occasion required)
both those troopes wholie togither to helpe other without breaking. The Scots comming
forward, pricking and whouping after their old woont, the Englishmen forbare a great while,
till at the last, foure or fiue hundred of them came scattered vpon the spurre, with a maruellous shout within a stones length of the formost troope.</p>
<p>These thinking then to haue wh&eacute;eled about, maister Nicholas Gainesford, the leader of

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
their horsses might beare them, losing of their companies that were taken and slaine, to the
number of eight hundred and more (as some haue written) [at what time the lord Hume
(as saith Lesleus lib. 10. pa. 486) falling from his horsse, was grieuouslie wounded, and
caried to Edenburgh, and his eldest sonne was taken prisoner] but yet, as diuerse of the
Englishmen aduentured too farre in following the chase, they were distressed, and sundrie
of them-taken prisoners, among the which were some of their capteins, as sir Rafe Bulmer,
<note place="marg">English capteins taken.</note>
Thomas Gower, &amp; Robert Crouch, each of them hauing in charge the leading of seuerall
bands of light horssemen. Thus much for this Fridaies skirmish, wherein the chiefest
force of the Scotish horssemen was defeated, to the great discouragement of the rest.</p>
<p>*The English armie remaining still at Preston, did from a hill behold the number of

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 15.</note>
the Scots, who (supposing that they saw a greater number than in truth there was) assembled in the meane time to consult of the estate of their affires. And therevpon sent letters
to the Scots, desiring that if they might obteine anie thing by iustice, that they should rather
end the warre with couenants than with canons. The effect of which letters tended to
this end. "That the English did greatlie intreat the Scots, first to remember that both
armies were christian men, to and of whome (vnlesse they vtterlie forget their profession)
there should nothing be more welcome nor desired than peace &amp; tranquillitie, and nothing
more detestable than warre and vniust force. Besides this, that the cause of this present
warre did not grow of couetousnesse, hatred or enuie, but from the desire of perpetuall
peace, which could not be better or more firmelie established by any means, but by the
league of matrimonie (being promised and confirmed by the publike consent and pledge
of the nobilitie) with those conditions which were more beneficiall for the Scots than the
English, being such as did not call them into seruitude, but into a felowship and liberall
imparting of all their fortunes each to other. For so much more should that mariage be
commodious to the Scots than to the English, by how much the hope of profit, and the feare
of iniuries should b&eacute;e greater from the stronger to the weaker.</p>
<p>"Wherefore they should chieflie consider (and in this kind) this to be their greatest reason,
that since that their qu&eacute;ene was of necessitie to be giuen in mariage by the Scots, and that
the same necessitie was not to be auoided; and the moderation therein verie hard: that the
anelie power to choose hir a husband was left vnto the publike councell or parlement.
And if they would choose (to their qu&eacute;ene) a husband for the publike profit and dignitie:
of whome could they better take choise, than of a king their neighbor, borne in the same
Iland, n&eacute;ere of bloud, instructed in the same lawes, brought vp in the same maners and
language; not their superior onelie in riches, but almost also in all commodities and ornaments of externall things, and such a person which did bring with him peace, concord,
amitie, and the forgetting of all old iniuries? But if they call to them anie other (differing
from them in language, maners, and lawes) to take the kingdome: let them thinke with

themselues, what and how manie discommodities will grow thereby, and to what euill
counsels they shall indanger themselues: the which they may learne by the example of
other nations, being farre better to be taught it by the misfortunes of others, than to f&eacute;ele
the smart thereof by their owne experience.</p>
<p>"Wherefore (as touching themselues) if they shall not perceiue the Scotish nation to be
estranged from this amitie and concord, they would mitigate somwhat of their former promises (which by law they might chalenge) and be contented that the maiden queene should
be brought vp amongst them, and b&eacute;e alwaies in their power, vntill the time that nature
should inable hir fit for mariage, and vntill such time as she might choose hir a husband by
the aduise of the nobiltie. And that in the meane time (vntill the same might be performed) that both the nations should absteine from warre: and that also the qu&eacute;ene (during that time) should neither be conueied into anie strange nation: nor that they should
conclude anie pact or couenant with the French, or anie other forreine prince touching
hir mariage. The which if the Scots would most holilie and handfastlie promise, the English
would foorthwith depart with a quiet armie. And further, that if the English had committed
anie hurt or spoile (since they came into the countrie) they would recompense the same
by the iudgement of good men."</p>
<p>These letters thus sent, the gouernor did impart vnto a few, and of those especiallie to
Iohn his brother bishop of saint Andrews (taken vnto him in place &amp; authoritie of the slaine
cardinall.) These two aduanced with great hope of victorie, were the cause that these letters
were suppressed, bicause they feared that if the equall conditions of peace were knowne
abroad, the most part would willinglie incline to the same quiet aduise. Wherefore they
procured a false rumor to be spread through the host, that the English men were come
thither with determination to take awaie the qu&eacute;ene by force, and by strength of armes to
bring the whole kingdome into their subiection. For the gouernor being faint spirited by
nature, had chosen vnto him foure such other councellors (like vnto himselfe) in the affairs
of warre, by whose command &amp; becke all things were performed. Of which number were
his three kinsmen, Iohn archbishop of saint Andrews, the abbat of Dunfermling, George
Durie, with Archembald Beton; and the fourth was Hugh Rigs a lawier, rather famous
for his grosse bodie and foolish conditions, than anie knowledge in militarie affaires. These

counsell by the wind of euerie rumor) that he would with stopped eares heare all other mens
opinions. In the meane time, his friends hauing spread a feined tale (through the Scotish
host) by him deuised, the Scots ran in all hast to their weapons, whose vnaduised sp&eacute;ed
was in the end the cause of their vnfortunate proc&eacute;edings, as after shall appeare.)</p>
<p>For being true (as the Scots haue reported) that the gouernor, and the nobilitie of 
<note place="marg">The Scots meant not to haue giuen battell.</note>
Scotland meant not to hazard battell within their owne realme, but rather to lie still and defend
their ground, if the Englishmen should come forward to giue them battell there. The
Englishmen aduertised thereof, the morrow after this great skirmish, raised their field verie
earlie, purposing to take an hill called Pinkhill, where they might place their ordinance, and
<note place="marg">The purpose of the Englishmen.</note>
to shoot into the Scotish campe, whereby they should force the Scots to dislodge from their
ground of aduantage. The gouernor and the Scotish lords, beholding their enimies thus
marching forward, thought best to staie their enterprise, and therefore suddenlie, notwithstanding their former determination, rushing foorth of their campe, passed forward to incounter their enimies.</p>
<p>They were diuided into thr&eacute;e battels; Archembald Dowglasse earle of Angus, with

certeine lords with him, led the vant-gard; George Gordon earle of Huntleie, and his friends
the rere-ward; and the gouernor accompanied with the earle of Argile and the rest of the
noble men, were in the maine battell. The Englishmen hauing got the hill, and perceiuing
the Scots to come forwards with great hast, staied for their comming: but the Scots were
so rash and hastie, passing first through the water in their armour, and so vp towards the
hill, that continuing their march with such speed, as they seemed rather to trot, than to

keepe anie ordinarie marching pase, before they could come to ioine with the Englishmen,
they were almost out of breath.</p>
<p>Howbeit, the earle of Angus, and the other in the vant-gard, boldlie abid the charge of
all the English horssemen, and so rigorouslie reincountred them, that slaieng and beating
<note place="marg">The English horssemen beaten backe.</note>
downe no small number both of men and horsses, they put the rest to flight; so that no
small part of them retired backe in such disorder, that they ran thorough the rankes of the
footmen in the fore-ward, wherwith such feare entered among the Englishmen, that (as hath
b&eacute;ene reported) they had vndoubtedlie fled, if the manfull courage of the earle of 
<note place="marg">The valiantnesse of the earle of Warwike.</note>
Warwike had not b&eacute;ene shewed at that present, according to the woonted valure of his often
approoued prowesse, whereby he caused them to staie, and relie themselues againe.</p>
<p>In the meane time, the battell and the rere-ward of the Scots aduanced forward with great
courage. But there was a gallie &amp; two pinesses of the English fl&eacute;et, which from the sea
<note place="marg">The gallie and pinnesses.</note>
shot so terriblie at the Scotish armie, that the same was not onelie sore galled and indamaged thereby, but also staied, that they could not come easilie forward. And h&eacute;erewith the English vant-gard incouraged with the comfortable woords and behauior of the
earle of Warwike, and other the capteins, made towards the Scotish vant-gard againe:
the which not able of it selfe to resist, retired in good order to the great battell of Scotland. Wherevpon, the multitude fearing, by reason they saw them in the fore-ward thus
retire (albeit in good order) that all had b&eacute;ene lost, gaue backe, and tooke them to flight;
whome the Englishmen followed amaine, slaieng the Scotishmen downe on heaps in
passing great numbers. Manie were also drowned in the water of Vndereske, through the
which they tooke their flight.</p>
<p>The earle of Huntleie and the rere-gard stood still with their ensignes and banners, till the
chase was past by them: but at length were driuen to make awaie as well as the rest, and
the earle himselfe in the retire being taken on foot, well clad in gilt armour inameled, was
<note place="marg">The earle of Huntlieie taken prisoner.</note>
led prisoner to the lord protector. Diuerse other men of name, barons, and knights,
were taken prisoners. There were slaine no small number of personages of good account.

a few which did impute iustlie to happen to the Scots, because they did arrogantlie reiect
such honorable and beneficiall peace, and did hope (if they obteined the victorie) to haue

by the English power. The duke of Summerset hauing remained at Leith eight daies,

<note place="marg">The English armie returneth homewards.</note>

<note place="marg">Hume castell rendred to the Englishmen.</note>
burnt a peece of it, and demanding the eastell of Edenburgh, but could not obteine it, departed thence the eight&eacute;enth of December homewards the next waie, ouer the mounteins of
Soutreie, comming the third day before the castell of Hume, where they did so much by
countenancing to win that fortresse, that within thr&eacute;e or foure daies after their comming
thither, it was surrendred.</p>
<p>This castell being woone, &amp; a garrison left therein to k&eacute;epe it, they remooued to Rockesburgh, where within the compasse of the ruinous wals of an old castell, they built a fort; &amp;
after returning into England, left a conuenient garrison to k&eacute;epe it. They got also about
the same time a strong fortresse, called Fast castell, standing n&eacute;ere to the sea side, and

<note place="marg">Broughtie crag woone.</note>
placed a garrison within it. And moreouer, in this meane time, their fl&eacute;et by sea wan

(as in the English historie it may further appeere) and in what sort also all the chiefest lords
and gentlemen of the Mers and Tiuidale came in, and submitted themselues to the duke
of Summerset, vpon assurance had and giuen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whilest the duke of Summerset with his armie did thus inuade Scotland on
the east part, it was ordeined by the said duke, and other of the councell to the king of
England, that Matthew earle of Lennox, and Thomas lord Wharton, then warden of the
west marches of England, should with a power inuade Scotland on the west side, to the
end that there should not anie of the west borders nor countries come to assist the gouernor against the duke of Summersets armie, but be driuen to remaine at home to defend
their owne countrie. Herevpon, there was an armie leuied, to the number of fiue thousand
footmen, and eight hundred light horssemen, with which power the earle of Lennox and
the lord Wharton entering Scotland the eight of September, incamped the first night vpon
the water of Eske, and marched the next day through the nether part of Annandale,
till they came to the castell of Milke, a fortresse of good strength, the wals being 
<note place="marg">The castell of Milke y&eacute;elded.</note>
foureteene foot thicke.</p>
<p>Capteine of this castell was one Iohn Steward, brother to the lard thereof, who vpon the
approch of the earle of Lennox, y&eacute;elded the house to him, without anie shew of resistance. Wherevpon, Ferguse Graham, brother to Richie Graham of Erske, was appointed
with a garrison of souldiors to keepe that castell to the vse of the yoong king of England,
and was afterwards confirmed capteine there with fiftie light horssemen, by appointment of
the duke of Summerset, &amp; the councell; so that during the wars, he remained there to the
great annoiance of the Scots, enimies to England, and preseruation of the countrie thereabouts to the king of Englands vse.</p>
<p>On the twentith of September, the earle of Lennox, and the lord Wharton, incamped
n&eacute;ere to the towne of Annand, and on the morrow after approching n&eacute;erer to the same,
gaue summons vnto the capteine therof, called Lion, of the house of Glams, who with an
hundred Scots [whereof Maxwell and Iohnstone, and Cokpull (as saith Lesleus lib. 10. pa.

verie strong and mightilie reinforced with earth: they within therefore refused to y&eacute;eld, and
valiantlie defended themselues. The greatest p&eacute;eces of artillerie, which the Englishmen had
there at that time, were certeine double and single falcons, wherewith they beat onelie the
battlements, till they might with certeine engines approch hard to the wals, and vndermme

<note place="marg">The st&eacute;eple y&eacute;elded.</note>
their liues onelie saued, and the capteine to remaine prisoner, and to go into England. Immediatlie vpon their comming foorth of the steeple, fire was giuen vnto the traines of powder in the mines, and so both the church &amp; steeple were blowen vp into the aire, &amp; raced
<note place="marg">The church and st&eacute;eple of Annand blowen vp with powder.</note>
downe to the ground. This doone, they burnt the towne (after they had sacked it) and left
not one stone standing vpon an other, for that the same towne had euer beene a verie noisome neighbour to England.</p>
<p>The Englishmen had conceiued such spite towards this towne, that if they saw but a p&eacute;ece of
timber remaining vnburnt, they would cut the same in p&eacute;eces with their bils. The countrie herewith was striken in such feare, that the next day all the Kilpatrikes and the Iordeins,
<note place="marg">The Scots that came to assure themselues.</note>
the lards of Kirkmichell, Apilgirtht, Closburne, Howmendes, Nubie, and the Irrewings, the
Bels, the Rigs, the Murreies, and all the clanes and surnames of the neather part of Annerdale, came in, and receiued an oth of obeisance, as subiects to the king of England, deliuering pledges for their assured loialtie. The residue that would not come in and submit
themselues, had their houses burnt, their goods and cattell fetched awaie by the English
light horssemen, that were sent abroad into the countrie for that purpose.</p>
<p>These things thus executed, the earle of Lennox, and the lord Wharton, returned backe
into England with their prisoners, booties, and spoiles, receiuing great thanks and commendations by gentle letters on the fiue &amp; twentith of September, from the duke of Summerset,
then lieng at Rockesburgh, about fortifieng of that place. The gouernor perceiuing thus
<note place="marg">The gouernors sute to the qu&eacute;ene Dowager, and to the French ambassadors.</note>
that without the assistance of France he should not be able to resist the Englishmen, hauing
now got such foot hold within the realme of Scotland, required the queene Dowager, and
monsieur Doisell, liger ambassador for the French king, to persuade with him by letters, to
send an armie into Scotland, to the aid of his fiiends there.</p>
<p>The qu&eacute;ene and monsieur Doisell, perceiuing a readie waie prepared to bring that to passe
which they most desired (which was, to haue the qu&eacute;ene of Scotland ordered in all things
by the French kings aduise) they vndertooke to procure an armie out of France, according
to the gouernors desire, if he with the states of the realme would agr&eacute;e that the qu&eacute;ene

might be sent into France, and a contract made for hir bestowing in mariage, as stood with

and by their aduises, passed certeine couenants to the effect aforesaid, &amp; sent the same in
writing by certeine messengers into France.</p>
<p>The French king gladlie accepting this message, prepared a nauie of ships and gallies to

king of England, appointed the earle of Lennox to make a new inuasion into Scotland,
and to vse for triall of their fidelities the helpe of two thousand Scotish light horssemen, that
were alreadie assured &amp; sworne to serue the king of England in all such exploits in which
they should be imploied.</p>
<p>The earle of Lennox desirous to aduance the king of Englands affaires, and hauing receiued letters from William earle of Glencarne, with promise of his assistance, and likewise
of his father in law the earle of Angus, the lard of Drumlanrig, and those lards and gentlemen of the countries of Kile, Conningham, Renfreu, and Lennox, entered Scotland about

purposes: who perceiuing his double dealing, and finding no such forces readie to assist him, as he
looked for, and moreouer, mistrusting the loialties of the maister of Maxwell, and the 
<note place="marg">Now lord Harries.</note>
gentlemen of Nidesdale, meaning (as he tooke it) to intrap him, and deliuer him to the qu&eacute;ene
Dowager, and the lord gouernor, stood in perplexitie what way should be the best for him
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox in doubt what to doo.</note>
to follow, thinking it not to stand with his honor to returne, without atchiuing some enterprise.</p>
<p>The earle of Glencarne had shewed to him two letters written by the lard of 
<note place="marg">The lard of Drumlanrig.</note>
Drumlanrig, signifieng, that if the earle of Lennox came, accompanied onelie with Scotishmen,
he would both serue him and honor him in the best wise he might: but if he brought those
Englishmen in his companie, he would not onelie refuse to aid him, but also raise all the power
he might make, either by his friends or otherwise, to resist him, and proffer him a repulse.
The earle thus perceiuing that he was in danger to be betraied among them, and that there
were all the deuises practised that might be to staie those that should come to the deuotion of the king of England, dissembled the matter with Glencarne, and other that were
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox dissembleth with dissemblers.</note>

<note place="marg">1547. <emph>Buch.</emph></note>
suborned to betraie him; pretending to them, that he would follow the course of their deuises.</p>
<p>But in the meane time he got togither the English capteins that were appointed to attend
him, and all such Scotishmen as he knew he might trust. And meaning to scourge Drumlanrig, &amp; to cut him short, for that he was the chiefe instrument to staie all the Scotishmen
in those parties from entering friendship with the Englishmen: he gaue secret warning to all
the capteins &amp; leaders about nine of the clocke at night, that they should be readie with their
men to mount on horsbacke at the sound of the trumpet, and k&eacute;epe with them the earle of
Glencarne, the maister of Maxwell, the lards of Closburne, Kirkmichell, and others the gentlemen of Nidesdale and Annandale.</p>
<p>He sent foorth six hundred chosen horssemen vpon sound of the trumpet, at twelue of
<note place="marg">Horssemensent foorth to scourge Drumlanrig.</note>

<note place="marg">They harrie the countrie about Drumlanrig.</note>
the clocke at night, vnder the leading of Henrie Wharton, and other the capteins of the
garrisons, who in the dawning of the next morrow, arriued neere the place of Drumlanrig,
where they appointed foure hundred of their horssemen to passe to the forraie, who raised
fire, and burnt two miles in length, both townes and villages on ech side, euen hard to the
gates of Drumlanrig, spoiling the houses of goods and riches, woorth to the value of two
thousand marks, got thr&eacute;e thousand sh&eacute;epe, two thousand herd of great cattell, beside nine
score horsses and mares.</p>
<p>The Annandalers laden with spoile and cattell, being in number foure hundred men, departed with their preie homewards. The lard of Drumlanrig, lieng all this while in ambush
with seuen hundred men, forbare to breake out to giue anie charge vpon his enimies, doubting least the earle of Lennox had kept a stale behind: but now after he perceiued that the
most part of the enimies were departed, and that the residue of the gentlemen &amp; capteins of
the English horssemen were withdrawing towards Dunfreis, being not past six score men,
<note place="marg">Drumlanrig pursueth the Englishmen.</note>
he fiercelie followed after them with his power, in hope not onelie to cuerthrow and distres
them, but also to take the earle of Lennox at Dunfreis.</p>
<p>Maister Henrie Wharton and those six score horssemen, retiring beyond the water of
Nith, and perceiuing that Drumlanrig and his men entered the water rashlie to pursue them,
returned, and gaue such a desperate charge vpon them, that Drumlanrig and his companie
were scattered and put to flight: yet Drumlanrig himselfe, although there were some speares

broken vpon him, through the goodnesse of his horsse escaped. Two gentlemen of his
surname and traine, that were in no small estimation with him, were slaine, and six score
prisoners taken, and led to Dunfreis. The terror of this ouerthrow, and the brute of the
earle of Lennox his entrie thus made into Scotland, caused the gouernor to leuie his siege
from Broughtie crag, and with speed to come from thence, the better to defend his

vnto Drumlanrig with a chosen power of men for that purpose. There were also vpon euerie
hill about, great numbers of Scotish footmen, with speares and lancestaues to assist the earle
of Angus and his complices against the Englishmen. The lard of Drumlanrig with a number of chosen horssemen was aduanced forward in sight of the Englishmen, as they were busie in firing the towne of Dusdere.</p>
<p>The assured Scots therefore, thinking the enterprise to be suerlie inough conueid for their
contriued purpose, openlie vpon the field neere to Dusdere, hoising vp a blacke pensill vpon
a speares point for a token, reuolted wholie, and ioined themselues to the lard of 
<note place="marg">The reuolting of the assured Scots.</note>
Drumlanrig and other their countrie men, &amp; thrust in betwixt the English horssemen &amp; footmen,
to the great perill of distressing aswell the one as the other. For making toward the place
where the earle of Lennox, and the lord Wharton were comming forward with their footmen, n&eacute;ere to the old castell of Dauswinton, sometime the house of the Cumins, they bruted
it abroad, that the English horssemen were quite ouerthrowen.</p>
<note place="marg">A false rumor spred.</note>
<p>The earle of Lennox, beholding the maner of his aduersaries, lighted on foot from his
horsse, willing the lord Wharton to doo the like; for this day (said he) I will die a true
Englishman. At length the English horssemen fetching a compasse in retiring backe from
Dusdere, came n&eacute;ere to the place where the earle and the lord Wharton were ranged in
order of battell: and thinking no lesse but that their horssemen had beene ouerthrowen, were
readie to march backe towards Dunfreis. But their horssemen thus comming in, and perceiuing how the matter stood, gaue a right valiant charge vpon the Scots, that stood countenancing the footmen, and readie to take the aduantage, if they might haue driuen them
through shrinking backe into anie disorder.</p>
<p>But such was the violence of the shocke giuen at that instant, with great manhood (vndoubtedlie) by the English horssemen, that the Scots were therewith put out of arraie,
<note place="marg">The Scots put to flight.</note>
scattered, &amp; quite put to flight; the lord of Drumlanrig being taken prisoner, corrupted his
taker, and so got away. The maister of Maxwell escaped in great danger of life, for he
had sundrie speares broken on him in the chase as he fled awaie. There were yet taken that
day of the Scots to the number of foure hundred, beside sundrie that were drowned in the
water of Nith. Amongest the prisoners were these men of name; the abbat of new abbeie, Christie Irrewing of Bonshaw, a brother of the lord of Hempsfield, &amp; manie other gentlemen of name. Dunfreis was rifled and spoiled, as the earle of Lennox and the 
<note place="marg">Dunfreis spoiled.</note>
Englishmen returned thither, and a martiall court appointed there for execution of pledges; but yet
suspended and staied, till the councels pleasure might be knowen in that behalfe.</p>
<p>There were at the first euill news spread abroad, and certified to the court of England
of this iornie, how the earle of Lennox and the English armie was ouerthrowen, so that it
was by order appointed, that the earle of Derbie, the Lord Scroepe, and Coniers, with their
powers should repaire to the west borders to garnish the same for defense against the enimies:
but vpon the true report how the matter had passed, made by maister Henrie Wharton,
and one Bishop a Scotishman, sent in post for that purpose, that appointment was staied;
and maister Wharton was at that time made knight, and the said Bishop richlie rewarded for
bringing so good news. Herewith were letters directed downe from the councell to the lord
Wharton, for the execution of certeine pledges, that is to saie, the maister of Maxwels pledge,
<note place="marg">Fledges executed.</note>
being one of his n&eacute;erest kinsmen of the house of the Herries, also the warden of the Greie
friers in Dunfreis, the vicar of Carlauerocke, and diuerse other which were executed at
Carlill. In this meane time were the forts at Lawder and Hadington built, the castels of
Yester and Dawkith woone, all the mils burnt within foure miles of each hand of Edenburgh,
and other exploits atchiued by the Englishmen, as in the historie of England is more at large
expressed.</p>

monsieur Dandelot coronell of the French footmen, the count&eacute;e Reingraue coronell of the
<note place="marg">The chiefe capteins of the French armie that came into Scotland.</note>
Almains, monsieur de Malleraie, monsieur Doisell, Pietro Strozzie coronell of the Italians,
monsieur Etauges capteine of the horssemen, sir Nicholas de Villegaignon a knight of the
Rhodes (or rather Malta) capteine of the gallies, and monsieur Duno commissarie of the
artillerie: with diuerse other woorthie personages, and men of approued valiancie. These
capteins with their powers being imbarked at Brest, sailed alongst by the east seas, and at
length about the middest of Iune came into the rode before Leith, where they landed their
people and ordinance. [A little before whose arriuall into France (as saith Lesleus. libro
10. pag. 491.) Chappelle Bironne landed in Scotland, accompanied with other nobilitie of
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
France, to giue good counsell to the Scots answerable to the time, which was (to please
their eares therwith) that there should a greater armie shortlie come out of France, to succor
their extremities.]</p>
<p>Afterwards, with the aduise of the goueror, and other of the Scotish lords, the French
<note place="marg">Hadington besieged.</note>
power went to besiege Hadington, and comming thither, incamped themselues in places of
aduantage about the towne, cast trenches, planted their ordinance, battered the rampires,
and kept them within streictlie besieged on each hand, vsing all the waies they could deuise
to constreine the Englishmen to y&eacute;eld. They forbare yet to giue a generall assault, bicause
they would not hazard (as they haue reported) the losse of so manie men as might haue
<note place="marg">Why the Frenchmen forbare to giue an assault.</note>
b&eacute;ene slaine and maimed thereby, to the great weakening of their power there, hauing not
meanes to supplie it when they would.</p>
<p>And yet they had a great armie of Scots with them for a season, and had made the breaches
so reasonable, that with small paine they might haue entered by the same, if the force of the
defendants had not sufficed with handblowes to haue beaten them backe, as no doubt there
was no want of good wils in them so to haue doone, if the Frenchmen had put the matter
in triall: yet during this siege, they within stood in great necessitie of things behoouefull
for the defense of the towne. Wherevpon sir Henrie Wharton with a band of light horssemen of the west borders, and others, came and put into the towne a certeine number of
men with powder, and other necessaries, greatlie to the reliefe of the besieged, &amp; no lesse
displeasure of the Frenchmen and Scots, that were not aware of this enterprise till it was
doone in the night season, by the good and fortunate conduction of them that had the conueiance thereof.</p>
<p>But after this, there came a power of English horsmen to the number of little lesse than
<note place="marg">The English horssemen ouerthrowne.</note>
two thousand demilances, light horsmen, &amp; harquebussiers on horsbacke, vnder the leading
of sir Robert Bowes, sir Thomas Palmer, sir Henrie Wharton, capteine Gambo a Spaniard,
and others; the which aduenturing ouer rashlie within danger of the whole French power,
were ouerthrowne and chased: sir Robert Bowes, &amp; sir Thomas Palmer, with a great number of other capteins, gentlemen and souldiers being taken prisoners, besides those that were
slaine. Yet after this ouerthrow of those horssemen, the French remooued their siege
from the places were they had first planted it, and lodged further off from the towne, continuing there; till at length by an armie sent foorth of England vnder the conduct of the
<note place="marg">The earle of Shrewsburie remooueth the siege from Hadington.</note>
erle of Shrewsburie, the lord Greie, and others, they were constreined to retire from thence,
as in the English historie ye may find more largelie expressed, to the which for the further
report of the euents chancing during that siege, I referre the reader.</p>
<p>But this is to be remembred, that whilest the siege remained at Hadington, by a conuention or assemblie of the lords it was decr&eacute;ed, that the qu&eacute;ene shuld be sent into France.
And therevpon monsieur de Villegaignon, with foure gallies departing from Leith, made
<note place="marg">Sir Nicholas de Villegaignon.</note>
semblance as though he would haue sailed into France: but hauing passed the mouth of
the Forth, he turned his course on the left hand to passe alongst the shore northward by the
Germane seas, that compassing the land on the east side, h&eacute;e might passe about by the
<note place="marg">The French gallies compasse about the realme of Scotland by Dungesbie head.</note>
Iles of Orkeneie, and so by the west Iles, till he came to Dunbreton where the yoong queene

being made or attempted with gallies.</p>

<p>At his arriuall &amp; conuenient landing at Dunbreton, he found all things readie prouided,
<note place="marg">1547. <emph>Lesle.</emph></note>
necessarie for the imbarking of the qu&eacute;ene, that he might conuey hir into France, for the

shewed such diligence in atchiuing that enterprise, that finally they arriued with prosperous
wind and weather in the hauen of Brest in Britaine with that yoong qu&eacute;ene, b&eacute;eing as then

with great preparation, &amp; there taried the comming thither of the king, at that time pacifieng
the seditions and turmoiles in the inward parts of France. When the king was come, h&eacute;e
gladded all men with his presence, and prouided that there was a large houshold, as well of
the noble men and women of Scotland, as of others appointed to the yoong qu&eacute;ene, which
he still increased (as the qu&eacute;ene grew more in yeeres) vntill such time as she might be
maried.)</p>
<p>But now to returne to the dooings in Scotland concerning the warres there. After that
the siege of Hadington was raised by the English armie (as before ye haue heard) the
Frenchmen therevpon retired themselues vnto Muskelburgh; and choosing forth a plot of
<note place="marg">The Frenchmen in campe at Muskelburgh.</note>
ground for their aduantage, kept themselues within the same. And herewith there came
to them fift&eacute;ene thousand Scotishmen to assist them, so that when the Englishmen came
forwards to assaile them, they found them so stronglie imbattelled, that (whether their commission did not so farre extend, or whether they had no liking of the match) they forbare
<note place="marg">S&eacute;e more here of in England.</note>
to set vpon them in that ground of so great disaduantage for the assailants, and so returned
backe to Hadington, and after homewards hauing furnished the towne with new supplies of
men, munition, and vittels sufficient.</p>
<p>Here is to be noted, that the English fl&eacute;et entering into the Forth, was readie to haue
aided the armie by land, as occasions might haue beene offered. But the lord admerall
<note place="marg">The lord admerall of England.</note>
perceiuing no likelihood of battell by land, tooke vpon him to atchiue some other enterprises,
and first comming to Brent Iland, set certeine ships on fire there, of the chiefest in the
riuer; and saluting the towne of Leith as he passed by with canon shot, he determined to
land some of his men on the north side of the Forth, to make some spoile within the countrie
of Fife. But Iohn Erskin lard of Dun, as then somewhat diseased, and returned home
<note place="marg">The lard of Dun.</note>
from the campe, caused such dailie and nightlie watch and ward to be kept, that this enterprise could not be so secretlie conueied by the Englishmen, but that the same was perceiued,
<note place="marg">The Englishmen repelled at saint Menets.</note>
and so preuented, that vpon their landing they were forced to retire with losse: and happie
was he that might first get againe to shipboord.</p>
<p>* For Iames Steward, brother to the queene (hearing of this tumult) came thither in hast
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 15.</note>
with the common people of saint Andrews, and some other few citizens which were remaining in the towne, to whome the neighbors about did also ioine themselues, vnderstanding
the cause of that assemblie. The English being now come on land, about twelue hundred,
stood in warlike sort readie for the battell, and with the feare of the artillerie (which they
discharged out of their ships) did easilie cause the rude multitude to flie awaie. But this
Iames Steward (by litle and litle suppressing the feare of such as fled) did (with such
violence) rush vpon his enimies, that foorthwith he ouerthrew them, put them to flight,
compelled them to returne to the sea with great slaughter, when also manie of them (as
they fled to their ships) were drowned, besides thr&eacute;e hundred that were slaine, and one hundred taken.)</p>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"559"</fw>-->

giuen for the building of a fort there, as in the English historie further may appeare. And
in the meane time monsieur de Desse, remaining in campe at Muskelburgh, hearing that
the English armie was remooued homewards, &amp; how diuerse new bands of horsmen and
footmen being left in Hadington, were readie to come foorth to skirmish abroad vpon sight
of the enimie; he tooke aduise, to trie if he might draw them foorth to their losse, and
therevpon was monsieur Dandelot, and the Reingraue appointed to choose foorth a thousand
of their lustiest footmen, the which with thr&eacute;e hundred horssemen were conueied and laid
close in ambush, behind a little hill not farre from the towne.</p>
<p>This doone, a few horssemen were drawne foorth to draw the Englishmen out of the
towne to skirmish with them. The Englishmen were no sooner aduised that the enimies
were there at hand in the field, but that all their horssemen issued out of the towne backe
with certeine footmen, and streight had the French in chase; who retiring, mainteined the
skirmish, of purpose to make the Englishmen more earnest to come forward. But immediatlie as monsieur de Desse saw his time, he gaue signe by sound of trumpet to the 
<note place="marg">The English men put to the woorsse at a skirmish n&eacute;ere to Hadington.</note>
footmen to breake foorth, who togither with the horssemen gaue so fierce an onset vpon the
enimies, that they were incontinentlie discomfited: and fleeing toward the towne, were followed by the French euen hard to the walles; diuers were slaine, and aboue an hundred
taken prisoners.</p>
<p>After this, monsieur de Desse raised from Muskelburgh, and comming to Leith set in
<note place="marg">Leith fortified.</note>
hand to fortifie that towne. The marshall Strozzi, and monsieur Dandelot, with diuerse
other capteins imbarking themselues in the gallie that yet remained, tooke their course to returne to France. One of the same gallies (they being eight in number, beside a foist and
<note place="marg">A gallie taken.</note>
a brigandine) was taken by an English ship called the falcon, as she passed through the
narrow seas at a place named the Southfurlong, she being alone, and (as it chanced) hindermost of all the companie.</p>
<p>After the departure of monsieur Dandelot, monsieur de la Chappelle de Biron remained
coronell of the French footmen in Scotland. As for the furniture on the water, there remained now but foure gallies vnder the guiding of one capteine Bach an Italian, a man of
<note place="marg">Capteine Bach.</note>
great experience and approoued skill. For ye must vnderstand, that before the arriuall of
the English nauie &amp; armie to the succors of them in Hadington, monsieur de Mallerie 
<note place="marg">Monsieur de Mallerie vice admerall of France.</note>
vice-admerall of France returned home with the fleet of ships that had brought the French armie
into Scotland. In what sort the lord Greie of Wilton afflicted the countries of Tiuidale and
Liddesdale, after the returne of the earle of Shrewsburie, is partlie touched in the historie
of England.</p>
<p>About the same time, there chanced a mutinie to rise betwixt the Scots and the Frenchmen in Edenburgh, by reason that a French souldier fell a quarelling with two or thr&eacute;e
<note place="marg">A fray betwixt the French souldiers, and the townesmen of Edenburgh.</note>
Scotishmen; and falling togither by the eares, diuerse Scots that came to depart the fraie,
would haue had the Frenchman to prison; but other Frenchmen being there also present,
would not suffer the Scots to take him awaie. Wherevpon arose a great tumult and stirre
among them, insomuch that there were diuerse slaine on both parts, namely Iames Hamilton
lard of Stanhouse, knight, capteine of the castell, and prouost of the towne of Edenburgh,
with his sonne; and maister William Steward one of the qu&eacute;ens seruants, besides sundrie
other. For the Frenchmen doubting some contriued commotion against them, assembled
togither in order of battell in the streets; so that before the matter might be appeased by
the capteins that shewed their diligent endeuors therin, they had inough to bring it to passe
as they wished.</p>
<p>The beginner of this businesse was hanged the same day in the market place of Edenburgh, where he began first to pike the quarell. Monsieur de Desse, to shew that this
variance had not proc&eacute;eded so farre as the brute thereof gaue foorth (for it was rather increased ye may be sure than diminished) vndertooke an enterprise in hand to win the towne
of Hadington by a camisado, but in what sort they missed their purpose, and how they
<note place="marg">The Frenchmen giue a camisado to Hadington, &amp; are beaten backe.</note>
were well beaten backe, and sent away by the valiant manhood of the English capteins and

souldiers then within the towne, y&eacute;e may read further thereof in the English historie. There
were seuen score (some say three hundred) slaine in the base court.</p>
<p>But now, forsomuch as I haue said nothing of Broughtie crag, sithence the lord gouernor
<note place="marg">Broughtie crag besieged by the earle of Argile.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Vtpian Ful.</emph></note>
raised his siege from thence, ye shall vnderstand, that (as some haue written) shortlie after
the earle of Argile came thither with an armie of his Irish Scots, and besieged it. But
when he saw he could not preuaile, he tooke truce with them within for a time, and before
the same was expired, there came new succors to the Englishmen: so that the earle of
Argile (by reason his people had remained there the full terme of their bounden &amp; ordinarie
seruice) was constreined to leaue his siege, and suffer the Englishmen to become maisters

y&eacute;ere, they purposed also to haue fortified Dund&eacute;e, and to haue kept the same with a garrison of souldiers; but hearing that monsieur de Desse with his Frenchmen was comming
thitherwards, they auoided the towne of their owne accord, hauing first spoiled the houses,
and after set them on fire.</p>
<p>The Reingraue with two bands of his Almains, and monsieur de Etauges with his companie of horssemen were sent before, who comming to Dund&eacute;e, and finding the Englishmen gone, incamped there, staieng till monsieur de Desse was come, that followed at hand
with the French footmen. Within two daies after, they going foorth to view the fort,
were in danger to haue beene caught yer they could get backe againe. For the Englishmen
and Lanceknights that were there with them (part of Conrad Phennings bands) issued
foorth, and droue them to retire, not without danger to haue b&eacute;ene distressed, if the
Reingraue had not vsed the greater policie in retiring the troope. To be short, monsieur
<note place="marg">The Reingraue.</note>
de Desse, to stop the Englishmen from entering anie further into the countrie on that side,
left seuen ensignes of Frenchmen, &amp; two ensignes of Scots within Dund&eacute;e, with artillerie
<note place="marg">Dund&eacute;e fortified by the Frenchmen.</note>
and pioners to fortifie the towne, &amp; to keepe it in safetie from the Englishmen. This doone,
he returned to Edenburgh, and sent the residue of his people abroad into the countrie, to lodge
in townes and villages here &amp; there, as was thought most expedient, for the better refreshing of them after their long trauell.</p>

knight (and senator) ambassador to the protector of England, which should for ransome
(as the custome is) demand deliuerie of the earle of Huntleie being prisoner: which if he
could not obteine, that then he should request this libertie, that his wife and children
might come vnto him into England. Wherevnto the protector answered, that he would
not set the earle fr&eacute;e, vntill the warres were ended: but for the companie of his wife, he
was content to grant it for certeine daies; with this prouiso, that he should not withdraw
himselfe by anie means from the custodie of Rafe Vane (corruptlie by Lesleus called Wane)
who had taken him in the warres. Wherefore, when the ambassador was returned into
Scotland, Huntleie was committed to certeine k&eacute;epers, who should carie him from London
to Morphet, distant twentie and foure miles from the borders of Scotland. Now whilest
the earle dooth there looke for his wiues comming to him, he thinketh vpon escape, and
to come to hir. For he had agr&eacute;ed with George Kar, that he should one night priuilie
bring to him thither, two of the swiftest horsses that he could get to flie awaie vpon them.
According wherevnto Kar was readie out of the borders of Scotland with such horses as he
knew would serue the turne, wherof one was for the earle, and the other was for his man.</p>
<p>The erle prepareth a supper for his k&eacute;epers, wherevnto they were solemnelie inuited, and
to plaie at cards with him to passe awaie the tediousnes of the night. At length (as though
he had plaied inough at cards) he left off, but earnestlie desired his k&eacute;pers that they should
continue on their game. During which, the earle (going vnto the window, and looking out)
did by a secret signe (for he could not well discerne anie thing, it was so extreame darke
ouer all the element) easilie vnderstand that all things were readie for his iournie. The earle
then doubtfull (being sometime in good hope, and sometime in feare) thought vpon manie
things, which he muttered to himselfe: and at length vnaduisedlie (as doubtfull men are

woont to doo) burst out in these speeches; "Oh sorrow, all these things be a hinderance
vnto me, the sharpenesse of the winter night, the doubt of my weake force and helpe, the
let of an vnknowne way, and the want of a faithfull guide: God prosper the iourneie."
His k&eacute;epers hearing him speake to himselfe, asked him what those secret sp&eacute;eches might
signifie: to whom the earle (knowing that he was guiltie of his fault) answered, that those
words were vsed as a prouerbe amongst the Scots: and first had their beginning by the old
earle Morton, vttering the same in the middle of the night when he lay in dieng. Whervpon (to the end that his k&eacute;epers should not haue anie suspicion of his determined flight) he
sitteth downe againe to cards.</p>
<p>After which suddenlie he rose from them, as vrged by loosenesse of his bellie to vnburden
nature, by which occasion he foorthwith (accompanied onelie with his seruant) leapeth
foorth, found the horsses readie furnished for himselfe and his man, got on them, &amp; with
speedie iournie did flie to the borders of Scotland. When he was passed ouer the riuer of
Tw&eacute;ed, and had a little refreshed himselfe from the labor of his iournie in the house of Kar,
he went the same night (being Christmas &eacute;eue) to Edenburgh, where he was ioifullie &amp;
honorablie receiued of the qu&eacute;ene, the gouernor, his wife, and his other friends, with an
vniuersall gladnesse of the whole multitude of the towne. As soone as his k&eacute;epers perceiued that he was gone, they sp&eacute;edilie run to horsse, and (doubtfull which way to follow)
they s&eacute;eke him here, and there, and euerie where, but all in vaine, for the diligence of the
erle put them out of all doubt for obteining him. Whose flight was not onelie a fr&eacute;edome
to himselfe, but also to manie other noble prisoners, who (vpon the assurance of his faith
and word) were permitted to depart into Scotland. The gouernor therefore, to congratulate
with the earle for his returne, restored vnto him the chancellorship, and the rule of manie
other prouinces which he had before his captiuitie. For which cause when he had remained a while at Edenburgh, he returned to the north parts of Scotland, where sp&eacute;edilie
and easilie he appeased all the tumults of those people.)</p>
<p>On saint Stephans day at night, the castell of Hume was scaled, and woone out of the

Englishmens hands. One of the surname of the Humes, a man of threescore yeers of age,

there abouts hauing that occasion, assembled thither at the day appointed, who taking their
burdens from the horses, and laieng them on their shoulders, were receiued (after they had
passed the bridge, which was made ouer two high rocks) into the castle, where (laieng
downe that which they brought) they suddenlie (by a signe giuen) set vpon the keepers of
the gates, slue them, and (before the other Englishmen could be assembled) possessed the
other places, weapons, and artillerie of the castell, and then receiuing the rest of their companie into the same (through the great and open gate) they wholie kept and inioied the
castell for their countrimen.)</p>

taking with him monsieur de Oisell, and monsieur de la Chapelle de Biton, hasted thither
with the chiefest part of his armie, sending before certeine capteins with their bands to surueie the house; who at their comming thither, vsed such diligence in following the offered
occasion, that they both repelled their enimies that came foorth to giue them the skirmish;
and pursuing them with great rigor, wan the lims of the house vpon them, forcing the
capteine and souldiers to retire within the dungeon, and kept them so short therein, that
they had opportunitie to mine an hole through the wall, of such largenes, as a man might
easilie enter by the same.</p>
<p>H&eacute;erewith a great number of Scots hauing broken open the gate of the base court, where
<note place="marg">The castell of Fernihurst woone by the Frenchmen.</note>
the Frenchmen were busie to assault the dungeon, burst in on heapes, vpon desire to be reuenged vpon the Englishmen, and namelie of their capteine, who (as they said) had doone
them manie great displeasures. The capteine perceiuing this, and doubtig if he fell into
the Scotishmens hands he should die for it, he presented himselfe at the hole which the
Frenchmen had made, and yeelded himselfe to monsieur de Dussac, and la Mouthe Rouge,
who minding to vse him as became men of warre, would haue led him out of the prese:
but suddenlie a Scot comming behind him, whose wife (as was reported) he had rauished
smote off his head so iust from the shoulders, that it leapt foure or fiue yards quite from the

<p>Monsieur de Desse returning to ledworth, aided by the furtherance and counsell of the
Scots, ceassed not in occasions of aduantage to attempt new enterprises against the Englishmen, as time and opportunitie serueda: and among other exploits, the castell of Cornewall

hauing a band of fiftie light horssemen Scots seruing vnder him, on a night had a faire hand
against a number of English horssemen, whome he charged so on the sudden, as he saw them
out of order, that he easilie discomfited them, and tooke more prisoners (whome he brought

<note place="marg">A road made by monsieur de la Chapelle de Biron.</note>
companie of horssemen that belonged to monsieur de Etauges then prisoner, and fiue hundred
footmen beside Scots, to make a road into England: which enterprise he atchiued in burning townes and villages, and returned without anie great losse susteined at that time. Within
two dales after his returne to Iedworth, monsieur de Desse dislodged from thence, &amp; taking

<note place="marg">Fourd castell woone.</note>
with him foure field p&eacute;eces, and all his men of war, entered into England, tooke the castell
of Fourd and burnt it, with ten small villages in the countrie thereabouts, situat within halfe
a mile ech of other. There was one tower yet parcell of that castell of Fourd, which was
kept by Thomas Kar, so that the Frenchmen could not win it, for they had no time to state
<note place="marg">Thomas Kar.</note>
long about it, remoouing that night ouer the water, &amp; incamped there within the Scotish
ground.</p>
<p>As the Scots and Frenchmen executed these enterprises, they were coasted by certeine
light horssemen; but neuerthelesse, the Frenchmen returned in safetie to Iedworth, hauing
sore indamaged the English borderers by that road: insomuch as it was thought, the Scots
(which were with them at that road) gained at that time, by pillage and booties to the
value of nine thousand crownes. The Englishmen sore gr&eacute;eued, that the Frenchmen lieng

so greatlie to their annoiance, assembled a power togither at Roxburgh, purposing to haue

he could not haue doone without manifest losse of his f&eacute;eble armie, hauing not past fift&eacute;eene
hundred footmen, and fiue hundred horssemen able to haue doone seruice: for such was

the miserie, which they had in manner continuallie susteined through want of vittels, and
other necessarie helps during the time of their incamping at Iedworth, that what through
sickenesse and hurts receiued in assaults and skirmishes, no small number of them were
<note place="marg">The miserable state of the Frenchmen in Scotland.</note>
dead, and manie other so f&eacute;eble, that they were not able to aid themselues; insomuch that
now being got out of danger, they thought themselues happilie escaped.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, in the beginning of the summer, the Englishmen armed fiue and twentie
saile of men of warre, the which arriuing at the Basse, n&eacute;ere to the mouth of the Forth,
assailed by faire and pleasant woords to haue persuaded the k&eacute;epers of the castell, there
standing on the height of a great rocke, to haue y&eacute;elded the place into their hands. But
perceiuing their persuasions would not be regarded, they tooke their course vp into the Forth,
and finding in their waie foure ships of Frenchmen and Scots, seized vpon them as a wished
preie: and the morrow next insuing, at the verie breake of day, they came before Leith,
and saluting the towne with canon shot, remained there at anchor ten or twelue dales, in
which meane while they landed their people at Inskith, and began to fortifie with all 
<note place="marg">Inskith fortified by the Englishmen.</note>
diligence. But before the place could be put in anie strength, the ships departed from thence
backe towards the sea, and left in the Iland foure ensignes of Englishmen, and one ensigne
of Italians, to defend the pioners and the Iland against the Scots and Frenchmen, if they
should attempt to assaile them.</p>
<p>After the English nauie was thus departed, monsieur de Desse, and the queene mother
being at Edenburgh, determined with all diligence to imploie all such forces as they might
make about the recouering of the Ile, before the fortifications begun by the Englishmen
should be brought to anie perfection. Heerevpon, monsieur de la Chapelle de Biron, 
<note place="marg">La Chapelle de Biron.</note>
imbarked in the gallie of monsieur de Villegaignon, rowed foorth to view the maner of the
Englishmens dealing within the Ile, which he did in such effectuall wise, that approching
within harquebuse shot, he brought knowledge with him not onelie of the state and whole
circumstances of their buildings, but also of the perfect number of their ensignes, and the
qualitie of the men of warre that serued vnder the same.</p>
<p>At that present also, monsieur de Thermes latelie before arriued at Dunbreton with an
hundred men of armes, and two hundred light horssemen after the manner of France, and
one thousand footmen, was come to the qu&eacute;ene, busie now to further this enterprise. She
had got togither within Leith hauen all the botes that belonged to all the cr&eacute;ekes &amp; hauens
of the Forth: so that on thursdaie after Trinitie sundaie, euerie thing being prepared readie
<note place="marg">The diligence of the Scotish qu&eacute;ene.</note>
for the purpose, in the morning by the breake of day the qu&eacute;ene was come to Leith, to s&eacute;e
the imbarking of the men of warre appointed that day to trie what successe fortune would
send them. There was no diligence wanting, neither among the Scots nor Frenchmen, to
<note place="marg">The forwardnesse of the souldiers.</note>
bestow themselues abroad, &amp; the comfortable woords of the qu&eacute;ene greatlie incouraged them
thereto, beholding them, and deuising with monsieur de Desse and the other capteins, till
they were all set forward.</p>
<p>Villegaignon with his gallies passed on before to k&eacute;epe the Englishmen occupied, so as
they should not perceiue the Frenchmens meaning: but they discouering the vessels at their
<note place="marg">Inskith assaulted by the Frenchmen.</note>
setting foorth, conceiued streightwaies what was intended: and therevpon prepared to keepe
the enimies off from landing, so that vpon the Frenchmens approch, they saluted them with
arrowes and harquebuse shot verie hotlie: yet at length by fine force the Scots and Frenchmen got on land, and drone the Englishmen and Italians backe from the sea strond vp to
the higher ground, where they stood at defense on a plumpe togither, dooing their best to
defend the place against the assailants.</p>
<p>But finallie, their generall named Cotton, being slaine with George Applebie esquire, a
<note place="marg">Capteine Cotton generall of Inskith and others slaine.</note>
capteine of an ensigne of footmen sent foorth of Derbishire, and one Gaspar Pizoni, that
was capteine of the Italians, beside diuers other gentlemen, and the most principall men of
warre and souldiers among them: the residue were constreined to retire vnto a corner or
point of the Iland, where they were taken without further resistance, although before they
had made verie stout defense, hurt and slaine diuerse Scots and Frenchmen, both at their

landing, and also after they were entered on land. Among other, monsieur de la Chapelle
<note place="marg">Monsieur de la Chapelle hurt.</note>
de Biron was striken through the hand with an harquebuse shot, and his burguenet beaten
so into his head, that his friends that were about him, were faine to conueie him into one
of the gallies to be dressed of his hurts by a surgian. Also a gentleman named Desbories,
which bare the said monsieur de la Chapelle his coronell ensigne, was slaine with a pike by
the hands of the forenamed Cotton the English generall.</p>
<p>Thus was Inskith recouered out of the Englishmens hands, after it had beene in their
<note place="marg">Inskith recouered by the Frenchmen.</note>
possession by the space of sixt&eacute;ene daies, the more to the high contentation of monsieur de
Desse, for that at the same time he stood vpon his discharge and returne into France, being
appointed to surrender vp his place to monsieur de Thermes, latelie before arriued (as ye
haue heard) with commission to receiue the same. So that monsieur de Desse, to end his
<note place="marg">Monsieur de Desse returneth into France.</note>
charge with the glorie of this atchiued enterprise, est&eacute;emed it much to stand with his honor:
and no doubt with the swelling humor of the glorie thence redounding he was blowen vp;
as in cases of victorie it commeth to passe in them that make a good hand: whereas the
vanquished (God wot) are contrarilie qualified.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, he returned into France with the gallies, and monsieur de Thermes 
<note place="marg">Monsieur de Thermes succ&eacute;edeth in his place.</note>
succ&eacute;eded in his place for the generall conduct of the French armie in Scotland. Who by the
aduise of the gouernor, and other of the Scotish lords, determined with a aiege volant to
k&eacute;epe the Englishmen in Hadington from vittels and all other reliefe. First therefore, after
that Desse was departed towards France, monsieur de Thermes with his Frenchmen and
some Scots incamped at Aberladie, where they began the foundation of a fort, so to impeach
<note place="marg">A fort builded at Aberladie.</note>
the Englishmen from setting on land anie vittels there, to be conueid from thence to Hadington, as before they had doone.</p>
<p>In this meane time, the Englishmen had increased their numbers of Almaines, and other
strangers, and not onelie furnished their forts with new supplies of men; but also had an
armie in the fields which lay most an end at Dunglas, and one while besieged Hume castell. But after they saw themselues disappointed of the meane, whereby they supposed
to haue recouered it, they raised from thence, and spoiled the most part of Tiuidale and
other the marches thereabout; in reuenge (as they alleged) of the disloialtie and breach of
promise proued in the assured Scots. Generall of this armie was the earle of Rutland, 
<note place="marg">The earle of Rutland.</note>
lieutenant at that present of the north parts, a noble man, right valiant, wise, well aduised,
and staled in his dealings, verie honorable and courteous in all his demeanor.</p>
<p>He was accompanied with capteins of good estimation and approoued prowesse, as sir
Richard Maners, sir Francis Leake, sir Iohn Sauage, sir Thomas Holcroft, sir Oswald
Wulstrop, &amp; others. He so behaued himselfe in that dangerous time of the vprores and
rebellions of the commons, through the more part of the realme of England; that although
the appointed forces against Scotland were staled, and turned to the suppression of the rebels,
to the incouragement (no doubt) both of Scots and Frenchmen in Scotland, yet they were so
fronted and kept in aw by that armie vnder the earle of Rutland, that they rather lost than
gained in this season at the Englishmens hands.</p>
<p>At one time the same armie, vnder the conduct of the said earle, passing foorth with a
conueie of vittels vnto Hadington, came so suddenlie vpon the Frenchmen where they laie
in campe, that whether through default of their scouts, or other negligence vsed by them, or
through the great diligence and prouident forwardnesse shewed by the Englishmen, the
Frenchmen were in such hazard to haue b&eacute;ene vtterlie distressed, that if the Englishmen
<note place="marg">The Frenchmen in danger to haue b&eacute;ene distressed.</note>
had not doubted more, than by anie was thought n&eacute;edfull, they might haue ouerthrowen,
taken, &amp; slaine the Frenchmen handsmooth (as was supposed) at their pleasure. But the
Englishmen euen at their first comming in sight of them (as it stood with the reason of warre,
sith by the aduenturing rashlie oftentimes in such cases too late repentance easilie insueth)
staled, the better to conceiue of that which they had to doo. Wherby the Frenchmen had
leasure to march their waies a maine pase, till they were got out of danger: for after they
once beheld all the troops of the English horssemen almost at their elbowes, and herewith the

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"565"</fw>-->

battell of the Almaines suddenlie appearing on the hill top readie to come downe vpon them,
<note place="marg">The Frenchmen retire.</note>
it was no need to bid them packe awaie.</p>
<p>The Scotish light horssemen comming on the backe of the English armie, perceiued where
the Almaines (to make them readie to giue battell) had throwen off their clokes, and left the
same (with all their baggage and stuffe which they had about them) in k&eacute;eping of none but
of their women and boies: wherevpon those Scotish horssemen, not minding to suffer such
a preie to escape their hands, came galloping in, and tooke all the best stuffe they could lay
<note place="marg">The baggage of the English Lansquenets spoiled by the Scotish horssemen.</note>
hold vpon, and returned in safetie, before anie enimie could come backe to the rescue. The
Almains were in no small chafe for the losse of their garments and other necessaries; but
there was no helpe then to s&eacute;eke remedie in that behalfe: for the Scots were withdrawen and
got quite out of danger.</p>
<p>The English armie, after that the Frenchmen were thus fled and gone, passed foorth to Hadington, with their cariages laden with vittels, to the great comfort of them within that fortresse, standing in great necessitie before this conueie came. This summer also, and a little before the vittelling thus of Iladington, vpon knowledge had that Iulian Romero with
<note place="marg">Hadington vittelled.</note>

<note place="marg">Iulian Romero distressed.</note>
his band of Spaniards, whereof he was capteine, seruing the king of England, was lodged
in Coldingham, six miles distant from Berwike: certeine bands of Almains and Frenchmen
came thither vpon the sudden, and surprising the Spaniards before they were aware of their
approch, set vpon them in their lodgings, tooke, and slue in maner the whole number of
them.</p>
<p>Things passing in this wise in Scotland in the summer of this yeare 1549, the 
<note place="marg"><date>1549.</date></note>
Englishmen were not onelie in the meane time sore troubled with commotions raised by the
commons of that realme; but also with the warres which the French king made against
them, within the countrie of Bullognois, so that they had not meanes to imploie their forces
against Scotland as they had determined to haue doone; as partlie before, and more largelie
in the historie of England is mentioned. By reason whereof, anon after Michaelmas they
gaue ouer the k&eacute;eping of Hadington, and raising their fortifications there, they returned
<note place="marg">Hadington raced and left by the Englishmen.</note>
into England to the great reioising of Louthian, to whome that towne had giuen occasion
of great troubles and calamities. Vpon the giuing ouer thus of Hadington, the gouernor
and the qu&eacute;ene Dowager were aduanced, in hope to recouer againe all that the Englishmen held within the bounds of Scotland.</p>
<p>But first it was thought good to assaie the winning of Broughtie crag; for it sounded
(as was thought) greatlie to the diminishing of the estimation, aswell of the Scots as Frenchmen, that the English should k&eacute;epe foot so far within the realme, in despight of their whole
puissance. Herevpon monsieur de Thermes about Candlemasse, hauing all things in a 
<note place="marg"><date>1550.</date></note>

<note place="marg">Broughtie crag woon by the Frenchmen.</note>
readinesse for the siege, came thither, and did so much, that with shot of canon to make batterie, and other meanes of inforcements, that giuing the assault both with Scots and Frenchmen, they entred the fort the twentith of Februarie by fine force, so that all those within
were either taken or slaine. Whervpon those English also that kept the castell rendred
vp the same without further resistance: amongest other prisoners, sir Iohn Lutterell the
capteine was one.</p>
<p>In this meane time there were certeine commissioners appointed betwixt the two kings
of England and France to commune of a peace: but because they continued long in their
<note place="marg">A treatie for peace.</note>
treatie yer they could agr&eacute;e, the Scots and Frenchmen surceassed not in occasions of aduantage to pursue the warre, so that comming before Lowder they besieged that fortresse,
&amp; skirmishing with the Englishmen that issued foorth, to incounter them, droue them in at
the gates with some losse on either part. And this doone, the French held them within so
streictlie besieged, that if peace had not b&eacute;ene the sooner concluded, sir Hugh Willoughbie
<note place="marg">Sir Hugh Willoughbie.</note>
capteine of that fort must n&eacute;eds haue yeelded through lacke of shot, &amp; other necessarie things

king of Picardie, in absence of monsieur de Vandosme; Gasper de Colignie, lord of Chastillon,
knight also of the order, and capteine generall of the footmen of France, and the said kings

Scots (as saith Lesleus. lib. 10. pag. 506, D. Paint&eacute;r bishop of Rosse.]</p>
<p>Among other articles comprised in this peace, it was couenanted, that all such forts, 
<note place="marg">The articles of the peace.</note>
castels, and places as the Englishmen held in anie part within the Scotish dominions, should be
deliuered and restored to the Scots; and that the forts of Dunglas, Roxburgh, and Aimouth,
which the Englishmen had built and raised out of the ground, should be raced and throwen
downe, to auoid all occasions of new controuersies that might grow by reason of k&eacute;eping or
defending the same: so as the peace now concluded, might in all points be firmelie and truelie
kept and obserued, aswell betwixt England and Scotland, as England and France, and betwixt all and euerie the subiects of the same realmes, both by sea and land. Monsieur de

Mourret was sent into Scotland with the copie of this peace, by whose means it was proclamed anon after Easter about the beginning of Aprill, and euerie thing vsed and ordered according to the articles of the agr&eacute;ement concluded.</p>
<p>In Maie the Frenchmen and Almaines were imbarked at Leith in sixt&eacute;ene French ships,
<note place="marg">The Frenchmen returne home.</note>
and certeine Scotish ships, and departed from thence into France. A few there were, as

of the British sea, and partlie for honors cause to bring them on their iourneie into France. By
whose departure Scotland was fr&eacute;elie deliuered from all forren souldiers, except certeine Frenchmen, who remained still in the countrie; because they had the Ile of Insketh and the castell of
Dunbar committed to their charge, which afterwards they did most faithfullie discharge.
Monsieur de Thermes, Chappellie, and diuerse other capteins of France, remained also in
Scotland (after that the others were imbarked to be gone into France) for pleasures cause, and
to s&eacute;e the countrie; who (trauelling ouer Scotland, and beholding the cities, searching
the castels, and marking the bulworks of defense) did constantlie affirme, that in the whole
world they neuer saw forts and townes more pleasantlie placed, or more naturallie defended,
In s&eacute;eing whereof they consumed the time with great pleasure, vntill the moneth of December,

continued three yeares: so was there within the wals and kingdome warre and dissention
amongest the Scots; which was most perillous and troublesome. For they which were the
chiefe rulers (as the gouernor and his brother the archbishop of saint Andrews and others)
did vse all things with extreame crueltie &amp; couetousnesse. For the archbishop, being giuen
to all libertie, followed by law his pleasures in all things, as though it had b&eacute;ene permitted

vnto him. For first, as a presage of his following tyrannle, he permitted the slaughter of
William Chreichton to go vnpunished, the same William being slaine in the gouernors house
(if not within his owne sight) by Robert Semple: next followed the death of Iohn Maluill
an old man of Fife; who next vnto the gouernor was most accounted of by him, as chiefest of
his familiars. This Iohn had his letters (which he wrote to an Englishman, to whome he
did commend a capteine his friend) intercepted. In which, although there were not anie
suspicion of anie fault, yet was the author of thempunished with the losse of his head.
Whose patrimonie made his death seeme the more vile; because the same was giuen to the
yoonger sonne of the gouernor. The hurts of these wicked parts did perteine to few, the
enimie thereof to manie, and the example vniuersallie to all. For by reason of this vnskilfull gouernement of the kingdome, and the slouth of his life, which offended the common
people; the gouernor began to be had in contempt almost of all men.]</p>

<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene Dowager saileth into France.</note>
Strozzie, sent and appointed with six gallies to haue the conduction of hir. From Diepe she
remoued to Rone, where the king then laie, of whome she was right courteouslie receiued.
and had such attendance and seruice doone vnto hir, during the time of hir tariance there, as
stood with the dignitie of hir person, and was answerable to the minds and expectations of
hir traine; to the high praise likewise of the king and his court in that behalfe.</p>
<p>The causes of the qu&eacute;ene Dowagers going into France were, that now hauing disposed all
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 15.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 508.</note>
things at home in Scotland, she might renew the old league in France, she might s&eacute;e hir
daughter and hir other friends; and procure the gouernement of the realme to hir selfe. For
the ambitious and subtill woman did thinke in hir mind, that the gouernor by his euill demeanor would soone be put out of his office, and that she might easilie find means to be
substituted in his place. But before hir shipping into France, and whilest they were preparing, the earle of Huntleie commanded William Makintosche (chiefe of the familie of the
Glenchattens, and his followers) to be apprehended (for a conspiracie secretlie begun against
<note place="marg"><date>1551.</date></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 508.</note>
him, whilest he was the kings deputie in those north parts) and from thence (being first depriued of all his goods) caried him to Strachbolgie, where he was beheaded. Which fact
(greatlie offending the minds of the earles of Cassils, and others that fauored the Makintosche) did so stir them against Huntleie, that a commotion and tumult had b&eacute;ene raised by
them, vnlesse the wisedome of the qu&eacute;ene had appeased the furie of their minds.</p>
<p>For although the qu&eacute;ene certeine yeares after, had vndoone the sentence of proscription
for the goods of Makintosche (restoring the same with the possessions and inheritances vnto
the sonne of Makintosche) and thereby had seemed to cut awaie the cause of dissention betw&eacute;ene Huntleie and them: yet the kindred and friends of the Glenchattens (not suffering so
great an iniurie to their familie to go vnreuenged) did secretlie (but eagerlie) pursue the
same with great contention of mind. Wherefore entring the castell of Pet by deceipt, they
apprehended Lanchlane Makintosche, and (condemning all his followers to banishment) did
<note place="marg">Lanchlane Makintosche apprehended.</note>
cruellie kill him (as the betraior of the head of his owne familie) because they supposed, that
he ministred and blew the cole that fired Huntleie, to make the said William Makintosche
out of the waie.</p>
<p>A little before which, the maister of Ereskine, and Henrie Senclere deane of Glascow were
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 509.</note>
sent into England; who at London did anew confirme the peace concluded before with the
English; from whence they passed into Flanders, to make the like league with the low countries, which they did renew, to the great reioising of both nations; although in the beginning of the treatie there grew great and contentious questions for the restitution of the ships
of Flanders and Holland (whereof the Scots had taken manie in the warres) notwithstanding
that the Scots had alleged, that they did not offer anie violence to those of the low countries,
before that they (by the persuasion of the English) had offered wrong to the Scots, in
deteining their ships and merchandize.</p>

<p>Thus much digressed from the qu&eacute;ene Dowagers going into France, wherevnto afresh to
direct our pen, we say; that being at Rone, the king did there openlie make shew of hir
welcome vnto him by diuerse arguments. Amongst which, this was not the least: that
(besides other shews, honorable triumphs, &amp; manie courtesies shewed to the Scots) calling
a chapter of the knights of the order of saint Michaell, he admitted the earle of Huntleie
and other chiefe lords of Scotland deere to the queene, and fauored by him, into the said
order. Which honors and pleasures s&eacute;emed the more augmented, in that the yoong qu&eacute;ene
of Scots was there present, adorned with such singular beautie, as was not easilie to be spoken,
by the iudgement of Lesleus. After that they had thus spent some time in delights of courtesie, to feed the mind and eie, the king of France, the two qu&eacute;ens of Scotland, and the
other nobles, departed from thence to Paris; where they were with great triumph of the citizens most ioifullie receiued. At what time againe, the French king shewed such humanitie to
Huntleie, and the other Scots; that he s&eacute;emed for euer most firmelie to bind them vnto him.
After that they spent some daies there at Paris, the king with that companie remoued to Blesies;
where he remained all the winter.</p>
<p>Now the qu&eacute;ene Dowager, thinking the time and place fit for the executing of the cause of
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 510.</note>
hir comming into France, and vsing therein the aduise of the duke of Guise, and the cardinall of Loreine (hir brethren) openeth the same vnto the French king, shewing that amongest
others, the chiefest cause to take that iournie, was to require his opinion, touching the gouernement of the kingdome of Scotland: and to know, if it pleased him that the helme of the
same kingdome should be committed to hir rule. Which if he misliked, or deemed the contrarie; that yet she would wholie rest on his determination. The which matter pleased well
the king, but yet with this promise; if the gouernor without anie tumult or raising of quarrels
would giue it ouer.</p>
<p>Wherevpon the qu&eacute;ene, to bring euerie thing about as she desired, did persuade the king
to confirme the dukedome of Chatelerault in France, vnto the gouernor, before granted to
him and to his heires, &amp; to make his eldest son erle of Arraine chiefe capteine of the bands
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 16.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 410.</note>
of Scots in France. And further, to giue the earledome of Murreie to the earle of Huntleie (kinsman to the gouernor) and to his heires; the earledome of Rothseie to his sonne,
which had maried the kinsman of the said gouernor; the whole earledome of Angus, to
the earle thereof; and the erledome of Morton, to the sonne of George Dowglasse. All
which he should procure likewise to be confirmed by such, as should be gouernors of the
yoong qu&eacute;ene. These things now doone, the French king carefullie receiued the yoong
qu&eacute;ene of Scots into his protection; vntill she should come vnto more sufficient yeers, able
to confirme all these gifts; the which if she refused then to doo, the French king wold then
bestow as large possessions on them in France.</p>
<p>In the meane time the gouernor had sent Carnegie knight and senator into France, who
should in the name of the Scots giue great thanks to the king for the aid which they receiued
out of France, against the Englishmen. After this the French king did liberallie open the determination of the queene mother of Scotland to the bishop of Rosse (then ambassador for
the Scots in France) to Robert Carnegie, and to Gawin Hamilton (to whom, as was said,
the abbeie of Kiluinin was giuen in commendam) to the end that the same which was at the
first secretlie consulted betw&eacute;ene the king of France &amp; the qu&eacute;ene Dowager, might now
openlie be considered among the Scots which were in France: declaring further, that he
desired nothing more, than that the qu&eacute;ene mother should susteine the parts and place of the
queene hir daughter, in the administration and gouernement of Scotland, sith the same mostlie
stood with reason and equitie; and that he (the better to win the gouernor to y&eacute;eld therevnto)
had giuen the gouernor the dukedome of Chatelerault, to his sonne the capteinship of all
the Scots in France, and manie other liberall benefits to manie other of his kinsmen.</p>
<p>And to the end that no deceipt might be supposed to be hidden vnder this liberalitie, the
F ench king willed the ambassadour to take possession of all these things in the dukes name.
Robert Carnegie hauing his errand, returned into Scotland; &amp; shortlie after, the bishop

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"569"</fw>-->

of Resse was appointed ambassador, who at length with much adoo did wring from the
gouernor a consent to part from his authoritie, and to applie himselfe to the will of the
French king: which thus in the end obteined, the bishop of Rosse goeth againe into France,
to aduertise the king what he had doone. Wherevpon the king considering his painfull
&amp; faithfull seruice, did reward him with the abbeie of Labseie in France.</p>
<p>Whilest these things were in dooing, Edward the sixt, king of England, did send the
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 511.</note>
marquesse of Northampton, &amp; other of the nobler sort of ambassadors to Henrie the second,
king of France, then soiourning at Blesies, to moue him to giue his daughter in mariage to
<note place="marg">Blois.</note>
the king of England. At what time there were manie martiall games and pastimes shewed
before the king, in which the English ioining the Scots with them as companions of their sports,
did beare a part, and wan the garland (from the others) to their singular commendation. The
summer next following, the French king accompanied with the qu&eacute;ene mother of Scotland
and other of the nobilitie, did with great pompe enter Turon, Aniow, Nants, and other
cities of Britaine, which he had not before seene since he atteined the crowne. After certeine moneths consumed in those iournies, he returned to Founteinblew.</p>
<p>But the qu&eacute;ene Dowager of Scotland, taking hir courteous leaue and farwell of the
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 512.</note>
French king, hir daughter, &amp; of other the nobilitie, departed from the court, and with easie
iournies came to Iamieslie: where remaining a certeine time, she had the pleasant companie
of hir mother the duches of Guise, and hir other friends to their great ioy: but that she
shewed a certeine griefe (for hir father latelie deceased) which somewhat diminished the sweet
pleasure of that m&eacute;eting. Now when the qu&eacute;ene Dowager had remained almost 12 moneths
or more in France, honorablie interteined, bountifullie feasted, louinglie saluted by hir friends
and kinred, and hauing obteined a willing grant of the effects of hir request, the Scots
doo vrge hir to hasten hir returne into Scotland, preparing at Paris all things necessarie
therevnto.</p>
<p>Wherefore departing thence, and comming againe to Rone, the quene mother mooued
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 512.</note>
and persuaded the nobilitie about the taking of hir iournie through England into Scotland.
By occasion wherof, loosing their ships from Newport, they passe the seas, and happilie landed at Portesmouth, a famous port of England. The knowledge of which arriuall comming to
king Edward the sixt, he presentlie sent thither the earle of Southampton, and the lord
William Howard to interteine hir: who receiued hir with singular ioy and courtesie, and
conueied hir through Hampshire, Sussex, and Surreie (three prouinces of England) to
Hampton court, where the king as then remained; from whence (after that she had b&eacute;ene
there most honorablie receiued) she came along the riuer of Thames to London, and landed
at Poules wharfe in the after noone, and from thence rode to the bishop of Londons palace
by Poules, and there lodged.</p>
<p>The fourth of Nouember, she rode in hir chariot to the kings palace of the Whitehall,
accompanied with the ladie margaret Dowglas, the three dutchesses, of Suffolke, Richmund,
and Northumberland, and diuerse other great ladies and gentlewomen, both Scotish and English. At the court gate the dukes of Northumberland, and Suffolke, and the lord treasuror
<note place="marg">Hir receiuing at the court.</note>
were readie to receiue hir. And at hir entering into the hall, the king stood in the vpper
end thereof, and the erle of Warwike holding the sword before him. She at hir approching to him, k&eacute;eled downe, and he courteouslie tooke hir vp, and kissed hir; and taking
hir by the hand, led hir vp into his owne chamber of presence, &amp; after into the qu&eacute;enes
chamber of presence, where he kissed all the ladies of Scotland, and so departed for a while.</p>
<p>She dined on the qu&eacute;enes side that day with the king, his seruice and hirs comming both
togither; the kings being placed on the right hand of the table, and hirs on the left. What
plentie of all maner of costlie meates and drinks there was, and what rich furniture of
plate and all other things was shewed to set foorth the feast, it were superfluous to write.
All the ladies both of England and Scotland dined in the qu&eacute;enes great chamber. After
dinner the king shewed hir his gallerie and gardens, with all other commodities of the place.
And about foure of the clocke, he brought hir downe againe by the hand into the hall, where

<!--<fw place="bot-left">"VOL. V."</fw>--><!--<fw place="bot-center">"4 D"</fw>--><!--<fw place="bot-right">"he"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"570"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

he first receiued hir, and there kissing hir, she tocke hir leaue, &amp; returned to the bishops
palace from whence she came.</p>
<p>* And here I must not forget what Lesleus hath set downe in this place for the defense
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
of his people, in not deliuering the yoong qu&eacute;ene of Scots to the English, to haue entered
the mariage bed of king Edward the sixt. Whose reasons although they may (the first
ground of the warre considered, with the consent of the Scots parlement to that mariage, and
the willingnesse of the English to haue caused them to performe their promise without battell) b&eacute;e well answered, as matters that not verie greatlie defend the cause: yet I will not anie
way say anie thing of him (being a man estranged from vs in religion, but learned, wise,
of great experience, a faithfull seruant to his mistresse, and a graue bishop of Rosse) but set
them downe plainelie as he writeth them, leauing the same to the iudgement of others, sith
I meane not in anie thing to derogate from them, or arrogate vnto our selues more than is
due. Thus therefore he writeth.</p>
<p>When the qu&eacute;ene (saith he) of Scots was come to London, the king of England sheweth
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 113.</note>
vnto hir his treasurie, openeth the monuments, laieth abroad the antiquities of the kingdome,
and laboured by manie other such kind of means, that he might prepare himselfe a passage
(with the open notes of courtesie) to obteine the good will of the queene. For he after persuaded hir with manie sp&eacute;eches, that she shuld giue hir daughter vnto him, as it was before decr&eacute;ed by the Scotish nobilitie: which he prooueth by manie arguments to be most
beneficiall vnto both nations. When on the contrarie part (if she were giuen vnto the
French kings sonne) it should not be profitable either to the cots, which should giue; or
the French, which should receiue hir to wife. Therewithall adding this vnto it, that there
should alwais be continuall hatred, and deadlie enimitie betw&eacute;ene him and that person which
should marrie hir.</p>
<p>Wherevnto the queene both presentlie and wiselie answered, that the cause of hir daughters mariage to be solemnized with the French, was onlie by reason of the protector of
England, which so bitterlie pursued the Scots with such earnest warre as then was made
against them. For it was vnaduisedlie doone of him, to s&eacute;eke to compell by force of
battell a woman, which is to be allured to the mariage bed with faire promises and flattering sp&eacute;eches. Whervnto she ioined, that the Scots were so vehementlie pressed by him,
that they were inforced to craue aid from the French; for the more speedie &amp; easie obteining whereof, they were vrged to leaue the yoong qu&eacute;ene of Scots in France for a pledge.
Wherefore she greatly grieued that the matter was so fast knit vp by the necessitie of time,
otherwise than the Englishmen would haue had it. But yet, she would labor the French king by
hir letters and messengers, with all the diligence that she might, to s&eacute;e if hir trauell and furtherance could doo anie thing with him therein. Thus much Lesleus, and so againe to the matter.)</p>
<p>The sixi of Nouember, the queene Dowager departed from London toward Scotland,
riding from Poules through the citie, passing foorth at Bishops gate. The duke of Northurnberland, the erie of Penbroke, and the lord treasuror brought hir to Shordich church, and
there tooke their leaue of hir. The duke of Northumberland had an hundred men after
him with iauelins, whereof fourtie were gentlemen clad in black veluet cotes garded with
white, &amp; hats of blacke veluet with white feathers, and chains of gold about their necks.
The earle of Penbroke had six score men well appointed also, with blacke iauelins and hats
with feathers, and the lord treasuror had an hundred gentlemen and yeomen with iauelins in
like maner, well apparelled: which thr&eacute;e companies of horsmen furnished the str&eacute;ets on
either side, from the crosse in Cheape, to Birchen lane end, as she passed that waie.</p>
<p>The shiriffes of London had the conduction of hir to Waltam towne end, where she
lodged that night: and in euerie shire through which she passed, the shiriffe, with the gentlemen of the same shire, receiued hir, and gaue their attendance on hir, till she came to enter into the next shire, where the shiriffe and gentle men there receiued hir: and that order
was obserued till she came to the borders of Scotland, and all hir charges for meat and
drinks, aswell for hir selfe, and whole traine, as also the prouision for their horsses, was

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"571"</fw>-->

borne and allowed by the king. [Besides which, (as saith the same Lesleus) Richard
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
Shelleie, now maister of the knights of Malta in England, and Edward Dudleie baron, were
appointed to attend on hir all the waie through England, from London to Edenburgh, where
she was honorablie receiued by the earle Bothwell, and the lord Hume.] The earle of
Huntleie, and diuerse other of the Scotish lords returned home by sea, the said earle landing
at Montrosse, about the latter end of December.</p>
<p>* After that the qu&eacute;ene was arriued in Scotland, she labored euerie waie to stop all 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 513.</note>
occasion of dissention; and that these bralles which were risen amongest the nobilitie in the
time of the warres, and were not yet fullie quenched, might grow no further, to bring the
common wealth (alreadie much impaired) into new troubles. Wherefore, by the aduise of the
gouernor, of the carles of Huntleie, Angus, and Argile, and by the qu&eacute;enes trauell, the controuersies mooued about the archbishoprikes of saint Andrews and Glascow, the bishoprikes
of Dunkeld and Brechine, the abbeies of Aberbrothie, Inchechafrie, and other benefices,
were ended: by bestowing some of them vpon noble mens children, and some vpon such
persons as woorthilie deserued them.)</p>
<p>Doctor Wanthop, whome Lesleus lib. 10. pag. 514 calleth Robert Warhope, a

Scotishman borne, archbishop of Armachane, so nominated by pope Paule the third, and after
created <emph>Legatus &agrave; latere</emph> by Iulius the third, deceassed this y&eacute;ere in Paris, the tenth of Nouember. This man was blind from his infancie, but yet gaue himselfe so to studie, that he
was first made doctor of diuinitie in the vniuersitie of Paris, and after atteined to such estimation in the court of Rome, that he was by the foresaid popes aduanced (as before ye haue
heard.) So that it is to be presumed, that the sufficiencie of his learning, (whereto he
must n&eacute;eds aspire altogither by the eare) (sith he was quite depriued of the benefit of sight)
coopled with other good qualities of mind, were means to preferre him first into the popes
fauour, and then to promotion of his bestowing.</p>
<p>This yeere in the moneth of Iune, the qu&eacute;ene Dowager, and the gouernor, went into the
<note place="marg"><date>1552.</date></note>

<note place="marg">Wrongs doone are by iustice redressed.</note>
north parts of Scotland; and at Inuernes, Elgin, Bamf, Aberden, and Perth, the gouernor
sat in iustice for redresse of wrongs, and administration of righteous lawes and orders. And
afterwards they repaired to the west parts, and sat likewise in iustice at Dunfreis, Glascow,
Lanricke, and in other places of that countrie, where diuerse were put to their fines for
transgressing the lawes, but few or none touched by corporall punishment. Which was but
a slender course taken in reforming enormities, and little better than impunitie; though in
leuieng of the fines (perhaps) a proportion were vsed: for by that meanes manie an offense
was red&eacute;emed by monie, and iustice was little better than bought and sold, as at a publike
mart.</p>
<p>* After this, they returned to Edenburgh, where all things requisite for the establishing
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 515.</note>
of iustice were confirmed by the counsell of the nobilitie, and of the wise senators. Wherevpon, when nothing s&eacute;emed to want for the setling of a perfect peace through all the
realme, but this, that certeine of the inhabitants of the east limits (accustomed to spoiles)
did by driuing booties of cattell from the borders of England, s&eacute;eme to offer new occasion
of warre. At this time, the gouernor goeth to Iedworth, and remooued such magistrats as
had negligentlie gouerned their owne prouince, or dispatched the generall affaires of the
kingdome: where taking pledges of euerie familie, he made them after that time in better
quiet. Wherevpon a long time following, there was a mutuall peace betweene England and
Scotland. About which time also, the protestants religion making breach into the doctrine
of the Romans, there was a prouinciall councell kept at Bithquoe, where the Caluinists
with their doctrine were condemned and accurssed; and all things decr&eacute;ed in the councell
of Trent vnder Paule the third, were established, with manie other n&eacute;edfull lawes made
to purge the corrupt manners of the clergie.</p>
<p>In which meane time, Dauid Panter or Painter (for I find both written) being a man of
<note place="marg"><date>1552.</date></note>
great learning, and famous by great experience, hauing faithfullie consumed seuen yeeres in
France, in the seruice of an ambassador legier, came out of France to Iedworth: where,

when he had declared to the gouernor (in the assemblie of the nobilitie) the reason, order,
and meane which he vsed in accomplishing of his office; he was greatlie commended of all
men. And for that he had so diligentlie, wiselie, &amp; trustilie performed that great charge,
he was with great solemnitie consecrated bishop of Rosse, in the presence of that assemblie.
At which time also, the gouernor did dub into the order of knighthood certeine borderers,
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 516.</note>
who had deserued well of the common wealth, to the end that their vertue adorned with
such honorable recompense, might be more inlarged toward the care of their countrie.
Amongest which persons so aduanced, these were the chiefe: Cesfurd and Fernihurst,
Andrew Kar of Littleden, Couldinknols, Greinherdie, Balclenche, with manie other valiant
men.)</p>
<p>In this iorneie (wherein the gouernor was thus the iustice) the qu&eacute;ene secretlie trauelled
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene mother s&eacute;eketh to be gouernor.</note>
with the lords, both spirituall and temporall, to haue their consents to be regent of Scotland,
immediatlie after hir daughter the qu&eacute;ene came to sufficient y&eacute;eres, and that the time of
hir tutorship were accomplished, or sooner; if the lawes of the realme would so permit.
And to assure hir selfe of their good wils in this behalfe, she contracted sundrie priuie bands
with them, making large promises of great rewards vnto euerie of them. To conclude,
<note place="marg">1552. <emph>Lesle.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><date>1553.</date></note>

<note place="marg">The gouernement is resigned vnto the qu&eacute;ene.</note>
this matter was so handeled by hir and others, to whome she committed the dooings therein,
that in the y&eacute;ere following, the gouernor agr&eacute;ed to surrender vp the gouernance into hir
hands, hir daughter the yoong queene being not yet full twelue yeeres of age.</p>
<p>The gouernor was promised not onelie a full discharge and a <emph>Quietus est</emph> of all his dooings, as well for receipt of monie, iewels, &amp; other things, during the time of his gouernement, but also a confirmation of the heritable gift of the dukedome of Chatelerault: likewise an other confirmation of all gifts and restitutions by him made, during the time he had
exercised the office of gouernor. And foorthwith the queene Dowager sent into France,
to get all these things dispatched, with such assurances of writings vnder hands and seales,
as was expedient, and to be sent home into Scotland for his securitie in all things.</p>
<p>* But before the gouernor had consented to the queenes demand, there was great 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 517.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1552.</date></note>
contention about the matter: for she well vnderstood that he would not depart with his office,
before the time that the yoong qu&eacute;ene had atteined to the age prescribed for hir full yeeres.
For it is ordeined by the law of the kingdome, that the king shall not remaine anie longer
vnder tutors, than to the age of fouret&eacute;ene; &amp; the qu&eacute;ene (as it is in other women) at the
y&eacute;eres of 12, at which times they may appoint procurators, which shall haue the gouernement of the kingdome vntill their full age. For which cause, the yoong qu&eacute;ene chose
amongst other (as after shall more app&eacute;ere) the qu&eacute;ene Dowager to be one: wherevpon,
the qu&eacute;ene Dowager challenged the gouernement vnto hir selfe, for that hir daughter was
certeine moneths aboue those yeeres of twelue. Against which the gouernor did stiflie contend, constantlie affirming that the yoong qu&eacute;ene did not exc&eacute;ed the age of eleuen y&eacute;eres.</p>
<p>Whervpon the qu&eacute;ene, to take from the gouernor all starting-holes and other shifts, dooth
vrge the custome of that kingdome, and the obseruation of those lawes to be, that they
must reckon the yeere in which the Scotish king or qu&eacute;ene is yet vnborne in their mothers
bellie, to be part of that number of twelue or foureteene; in which they may appoint gouernors to rule vnder them. Which the gouernor perhaps did seeme to confesse for the
king, but that the same was true for a qu&eacute;ene it did not appeere; sith it s&eacute;emeth to be
wrought by Gods high prouidence, that the kingdome of Scotland was alwaies h&eacute;eretofore
by manie ages gouerned by kings, and that a woman did neuer before this time (especiallie
one within age) challenge that kingdome vnto them, although the male line (as app&eacute;ered
from the Bruses to the Stewards) descended from the women, haue sometime possessed the
sterne of Scotland.</p>
<p>But in the end, saie or doo what he could, the gouernor did surrender his place (as after

yoong man, for deadlie hatred (as was thought) betw&eacute;ene those two families. Yet it was
spred abroad, that the chiefest cause why Ruthwen did kill Chartrusse, was for that Ruthwen
(being called into sute of law by the other) distrusting his cause, and supposing that it
would passe against him by iudgement, had none other remedie to relieue the matter, than
that verie day to kill Chartrusse. Which matter was the occasion of making this law, that
whosoeuer with force or armes did either pursue or abate, recouer or lose in anie action,
should not onelie be punished for the rashnesse of the fact, but also should haue the matter
foorthwith (euen in that moment of time) iudged against him.]</p>

was not so much in hir time afflicted with exquisite troubles of barbarous persecutors, to the
diminishing of Gods seruants, and the increasing of satans synagog, as it was like to haue
triumphed vnder the glorious title of the victorious gospell, if God had not (for the vnwoorthinesse of the English people) taken the yoong king awaie. For the prosperous beginning of his gouernement foretold an happie proc&eacute;eding, and a blessed ending. But to
returne to Scotland.]</p>
<p>* About this time, Norman Lesle, who (as you heard before) had fled for the death of
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 520.</note>
the cardinall Beton bishop of saint Andrews into France (where he then was imprisoned)
being now set at libertie, did priuilie conueie himselfe into Scotland. Which vnderstood of
the gouernor, he fined all those that had receiued him into their house, &amp; compelled 
<note place="marg"><date>1554.</date></note>
Norman to fl&eacute;e to Denmarke, for feare that (if he were taken) he should suffer extreme punishment. But when he knew that there was no place of safetie for him in that countrie, wandering ouer manie prouinces, he came at last into England, in the reigne of Edward the
sixt; of whome, with the rest of his companions, he was most courteouslie receiued, with
y&eacute;erelie pensions out of the excheker or common tresurie assigned vnto them for their maintenance, according to their estates.</p>
<p>But after that king Edward was departed the world, they all were also commanded to
depart the realme, to whome (earnestlie vrging that their pensions might be paied to them
in an other place where they should remaine) the duke of Norffolke did publikelie say in
the councell, that it s&eacute;emed not iustice, that a catholike prince should paie anie pensions to
such as had murthered a catholike cardinall. With which answer the said Norman was
almost stroken dead, and being then wearied with the griefe of his exile, went againe into
France, and there by king Henrie (by the meanes of the baron Brunstone, whom this Lesle
had sent before to request the same) he was made capteine of the Scotish light horssemen
in France. This man did so valiantlie, woorthilie, and honorablie behaue himselfe in warres,
which the French king had (with Charles the fift then emperor) on the borders of Flanders,
that he was alwaies formost in the front of the battell, to assault the enimie; hoping by
that meanes to wipe awaie the blot of the cardinals slaughter, and more firmelie to bind the
French king vnto him.</p>
<p>But after certeine light skirmishes (which he happilie performed against the enimie) following the battell at Renton (a towne in Picardie) most hotlie, and drawing n&eacute;ere within
danger of the enimie, he was so wounded with a shot, that he could hardlie returne to his
companie: but being relieued by his owne souldiers from the hands of the enimie, he was
caried to Montrulle, where he shortlie after died, greatlie repenting him of his former wicked
fact, and greatlie abhorring the other authors thereof, as furtherers of him therein. Towards

that was in him) that he procured all such of his Scots (as returned from the warres with
Brunstone) to be receiued into their owne countrie, and restored to all their goods and possessions.]</p>

couenants and articles of agreement, betwixt the qu&eacute;ene and the gouernor, were perfectlie
and fullie concluded, and thervpon a parlement appointed to be holden in Edenburgh, the
tenth of Aprill next insuing: and in the meane time the gouernor deliuered the castell of
Edenburgh vnto the lord Erskin to k&eacute;epe, as it were by waie of assurance for his part, that
all things at that parlement should be accomplished, according to the points of the agr&eacute;ement made by full consent. The lords then assembling in parlement at Edenburgh, on
the said twelfth day of Aprill, all the couenants of agr&eacute;ement had &amp; made betwixt the qu&eacute;ene
Dowager and the gouernor were presented &amp; read, touching the dimission and giuing ouer
of the gouernors authoritie, confirmed by the qu&eacute;ene hir selfe in France, with consent of the
king of France hir husband, the duke of Guise, and the cardinall of Lorrain hir curators,
with a gift of the dukedome of Chatelerault vnto the gouernor, vnder the great seales of France,

and others, to whome it apperteined.</p>
<p>After this, there was read a confirmation of the thr&eacute;e estates of Scotland, touching the

&amp; to establish him as second person of the realme [&amp; to haue the gouernement of the 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
castell of Dunbreton (as saith Buchanan] with other things conteined in the contract: to the
which there in open parlement all the estates subscribed, and put therevnto their seales.
Which doone, the gouernor gaue vp his office of tutorship, in presence of the said estates,

the queene mother, &amp; monsieur Doisell being there present, who receiued the same in the

<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene giueth the gouernance of the realme vnto the qu&eacute;ene mother.</note>
hir, and was thereto admitted by the estates of the realme. Then was the parlement newlie authorised in the qu&eacute;enes name, with consent of hir curators, and in name of the
qu&eacute;ene regent.</p>
<p>* Where is to be noted, that as at the first they which had the administration of the 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
common-wealth vnder the king of Scotland in his minoritie, were first called gardians, and then
gouernors: so now began they to haue a new title for the same, to be called regents of
Scotland, not before accustomed among the Scots, which name hath euer since remained
to all such as execute that place (euen in our age) during the minoritie of Charles Iames
the sixt, now ruling the scepter of Scotland. In which declination of things (as before you
<note place="marg"><emph>Buch. lib.</emph> 16.</note>
heard) to the gouernement of the French, the Scots could neuer be persuaded that the
castell of Edenburgh should be deliuered to the rule of strangers: fearing that if the qu&eacute;ene
should die without issue, that then the French would there by tyrannie settle themselues.
Wherefore the same was committed to the defense of Iohn Areskine, which he should not
deliuer to anie, but to one of the order, and of the nobilitie and parlement.</p>
<p>About this time, the qu&eacute;ene regent sent George Gordon earle of Huntleie to apprehend
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 522.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 16.</note>
Iohn Mudiard (or Muderac, as saith Buchanan) chiefe of the familie of the Reginaldins,
a notable th&eacute;efe, &amp; one that was fraught with most wicked d&eacute;eds: which iournie it is supposed that Gordon did not verie faithfullie discharge. Wherefore, when he returned without the dispatch thereof, in not taking of that man, he was committed to prison vntill the
day appointed, wherein he should answer the cause. Whose friends in the meane time (to
mitigate the enuie against him for the same) did spred false rumors thereof, laieng all the
fault in the familie of the Cathans: for they said that the same was hindered by them for
the malice that they bare vnto the Gordons: which speeches did onelie rise almost vpon
this occasion.</p>
<p>Whilest the qu&eacute;ene prepared for hir iournie into Scotland, Gordon did cast into prison

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"William"</fw>-->

<pb n="575"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"575"</fw>-->

William (the head of the familie of the Cathans) a yoong man liberallie brought vp with
the earle of Murreie for kinreds sake, being sisters son to the said earle; for none other
cause but for that he would not y&eacute;eld him selfe to the protection of him. Gordon therefore grieued at this man, did not thinke it safetie to leaue him fr&eacute;e and at libertie behind
him, when he should go into France with the qu&eacute;ene, although he could find no fault to
laie to his charge woorthie anie punishment. Wherefore (by his friends) he persuaded the
yoong man (ignorant of all deceit) that he should y&eacute;eld him selfe into his protection and
tutorship: for so by that one meanes, both the fame of the one and safetie of the other might
be prouided for, which the yoong man did accordinglie.</p>
<p>Wherefore Gordon being now lord ouer the life and death of this William, did (dissembling his hatred to him) breake with his owne wife to execute the yoong and giltlesse man in
his absence, supposing thereby to transferre all the malice which should rise thereof vnto
the fact of his wife, as not doone by his consent. Which fell out quite contrarie: for when
euerie one knew the subtill wit of Gordon the earle of Huntleie, and that his wife (a chosen
and rare woman) had passed all the rest of hir life within the bounds of womanlie modestie;
they were all easilie persuaded, that he alone was author vnto hir of that wicked counsell.
Wherevpon, Gordon being now cast in prison for that fact, there was (in a councell holden by the regent) great contention and varietie of opinions, touching the punishment which
he should haue. For some would haue him banished into France for certeine yeares, &amp;
some would onelie haue an excessiue mulct to be laied vpon him.</p>
<p>Both which opinions were reiected by the chiefe of his enimies, Gilbert earle of Cassiles.
For he, perceiuing by the present state of things, that peace would not long continue betw&eacute;ene Scotland and France; did vtterlie withstand his banishment into that countrie.
For he would not haue that man (being so subtilie and vnconstantlie witted, proud, and desirous of reuenge, of and vpon such as were emulous, or backbiters against him) to be a
firebrand and capteine to those French, who (he was assured, for their insolent pride) would
haue warre with the Scots. For although he thought, that of right he ought to be punished, yet he did not iudge, that anie domesticall euill was so much, or the punishment thereof
should be thought so great, that they should accustome the French to shed the Scotish bloud.
Wherefore at length his punishment was agreed vpon (as after shall appeare) in renouncing
of all his right to the earldome of Murreie, &amp; other things.</p>
<p>The qu&eacute;ene hauing the disposition of all things, did at hir pleasure change all the officers,
<note place="marg">Officers are changed.</note>
and made the earle of Cassils treasuror, &amp; Veilmort a Frenchman controller; also an other
Frenchman called monsieur Rubie, k&eacute;eper of the great seale, as vicegerent in place of the earle
of Huntleie, who was chancellor and then in ward; [and Iames Machill register, and the abbat
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
of Couper keeper of the priuie seale, as saith Lesleus. lib. 10. pag. 521. Bonald gouernor of
the Iles.] These mens counsell and monsieur Doisels she vsed principallie in all things. The
<note place="marg">The earle of Huntleie renounced manie things.</note>
earle of Huntleie being to be deliuered out of ward did for his punishment renounce his
title to the earldome of Murreie; whereof he had a gift in heritage. Also he renounced his
interest vnto the farmes of Orkenie and Sheatland, and to the earledome of Mar, and of the
qu&eacute;enes lands of Straits Die: and further was contented to go ouer into France, there to remaine for the space of fiue yeares. But yet afterwards the qu&eacute;ene was contented, that he should
still remaine within the realme, for the which he gaue to hir fiue thousand pounds in monie.</p>

good to haue a peace betweene both nations, and that their commissioners should m&eacute;et to
determine all controuersies. At what time for the Scots, were Robert of Kinwardie, and
Iohn Bellenden of Achnowle knights: and for the English, were Thomas Cornwallesse, and
Robert Bowes knights. At what time there were lawes made touching fishing, aswell in
the sea, as in certeine other limited riuers; by which all occasions of contention was taken
awaie from both nations. Richard Norton, a man of great counsell in prosperitie, and of
great stomach in aduersitie, being capteine of Norham castell in England, was at that time

cause of the making of this law for the commons; That if anie Englishman from a Scot, or
<note place="marg">The law for fishing.</note>
a Scot from an Englishman, did by force take awaie anie fish that was taken; that he
should paie the mulct of twentie shillings for the same: beside other punishments of the
common law.</p>
<p>Further it was agreed, that whosoeuer by force of tempest, or for anie other cause, were
<note place="marg">Conuenants for seamen.</note>
driuen into Scotland or England, he should not by anie pretense be staied; but he might
fr&eacute;elie by land or sea, either on horssebacke or on foot returne home. Prouided, that he
had the testimonie of the next maister of the port, or of the next towne, to witnes the cause
of his arriuall; and that during the time of his abode in such a countrie, he attempted nothing against the lawes of the kingdome. Not manie daies after this, Henrie Sinclere deane

of Glascow, senator, and vicepresident of the high court, did returne into Scotland out of
France; being a man greatlie familiar with Iames the fift, aswell for the singularitie of his
wit, as the excellencie of his learning.</p>
<p>But in the time of the gouernor, the courtiers (not greatlie est&eacute;eming such wisedome &amp;
learning) made no account of him, although the qu&eacute;ene Dowager, and diuerse of the nobilitie held him in great honor; aswell for his deepe studie in the best arts, as for his rare
knowledge of the publike lawes and antiquities of Scotland. This man, vpon his first returne, was foorthwith both author and persuader to and of the bishop of the Orchades chiefe
president, and to the other senators; that there should be new lawes made for the short ending of sutes in law; for the obseruation of a right course of iudgments, and for the raking
awaie of all euill customs. In the making &amp; tempering whereof, he was of so great iustice;
that such things as were set downe in the law, were more holilie and perfectlie brought
to their ancient forme than they had beene before.</p>
<p>The reason is readie; to wit, aswell for that in equall deliuering law to all men: as in
pleading, there was by his meanes more diligence vsed by the magistrats, aduocats, scribes,
and officers; in cutting awaie vaine and superfluous formes and orders: which ministred occasion, that their sutes did long hang in court, before they could be determined. At this
time also the marquesse of Maine (being after made duke of Almaine) who in the meane
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 524.</note>
time with manie other nobles of France, had remained pledges in England, did (hauing
licence therevnto) come into Scotland to s&eacute;e his sister, accompanied with sir Thomas Stewkleie of England now knight; who after he had remained some daies with his sister in pleasure &amp; delight, discharged his faith, and returned againe into England.]</p>
<p>In Iulie was a parlement held at Edenburgh, in the which manie acts and statutes were
<note place="marg"><date>1555.</date></note>

<note place="marg">A parlement.</note>
made, right profitable (as was then thought) for the common-weale of the realme. Amongest

First, that none of the citizens (in the feasts of Whitsuntide, or anie such times, in which
their hirelings are accustomed to go foorth) should assemble armed, to cast foorth the husbandmen after the, old maner. Secondlie, that the inhabitants m&eacute;eting togither, should no
more assemble vnder a certeine colour of gaine, which for exercise of the bodie (as it was
supposed) was holden after the example of one (I can not tell who) Robert Hood a wild or
vplandish man. Thirdlie, that there should be no priuat leagues contracted betw&eacute;ene subiects. Which lawes did after bring great peace, ease, and quiet to the publike state.</p>
<p>In the verie same yeare 1555, in the eight kalends of August, fell the mariage of Marie

commissioners should be appointed to m&eacute;et the next summer in the borders, to end all controuersies. In the meane time, whilest the qu&eacute;ene regent did administer the affaires of
south Scotland, Iohn Steward earle of Atholl was sent into the north parts with a chosen
companie, to breake the force of Iohn Mudiard or Muderace. At what time this earle vsed
such courtesie and counsell in pacifieng, and such celeritie and wisedome in executing of

things; that he brought the seditious Mudiard (impatient to haue anie gouernor) to the
qu&eacute;ene, to whome the said Mudiard did willinglie y&eacute;eld himselfe, his children, and his
kindred.</p>
<p>To which man, the qu&eacute;ene (in respect to singular clemencie, and pietie to all men, according to the disposition of hir nature) did wholie remit all his offenses, with this condition; that he should faithfullie remaine prisoner in the castell of Meffens, and in the towne
of Perth. But as the fox (as the prouerbe is amongest vs) cannot liue without his starting
holes; so this Mudiard and his companions, imbued with more than foxlike conditions,
did (deceiuing their keepers) returne to their owne caues, and afresh trouble all the north
Scotland with their raised seditions and spoiles. Which things inforced the qu&eacute;ene, that she
did go into those parts, to hold iustice of oires: in which she might bridle the euils of
weked men, and purge those prouinces from all the roots of sedition.</p>
<p>Wherevpon, in the moneth of Iulie, the qu&eacute;ene accompanied with the earles of Huntleie,
Argile, Rothes, Cassils, and Marshall; the bishop of Aberden and Rosse, M. Doisell,

Rubie, and others went to the towne of Inuernesse, in which citie (the faults known by publike
accusation) there was iust punishment taken vpon the offendors. And because there were
manie hidden in the higher and mounteine countries, which by their absence fled the punishment; she commanded the heads of the mounteine families, that they should bring
their guiltie countrimen and kindred to iudgement, according to the law established by
Iames the fift; with a great paine set vpon the chiefe of those families: if the other did
stiflie resist, &amp; would not come into iudgement.</p>
<p>Wherevpon it followed, that sundrie of diuerse families, that were by contempt departed
awaie, did come to publike iudgement. Where manie, and those not of the meanest sort, paied
the punishment for troubling the peace; amongest which, one Grant a baron being commanded to bring Iames Grant and diuerse other wicked persons before the iudges, did prouide to bring their dead heads, when they could not take their liue bodies. The earle of
Cathnes also, because that being warned thervnto, he did not bring his people before the
iudges; was first committed to prison in Inuernesse, then at Aberden, and lastlie at Edenburgh, from whence he purchased his libertie with a great masse of monie.</p>
<p>Mackeie in like sort, head and chiefe of the tribe of Strathnauerne &amp; of Glencone, being
called to iudgement (for that he had often wasted the countrie of Southerland next adioining)
did contemne the precept. Wherevpon the qu&eacute;ene prouided a great armie, which vnder the
erle of Southerland brake into Strathnauerne, where he possessed all the places of doubt, least
anie hole might be left for the th&eacute;eues to passe awaie from thence. Wherevpon Mackeie,
when he saw himselfe so beset (as that no place of flight was left him) yeelded himselfe to
Hugh Kenedie, who led him to the qu&eacute;ene, by whom he was committed to prison at Edenburgh a long time, but they of Glencone put in pledges, &amp; (being committed to safe and
strong prisons) were reserued to the iudgement of the qu&eacute;enes pleasure.</p>
<p>After this, the queene leauing Inuernesse, and progressing the prouince of Rosse, she came
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 528.</note>
to Elgine, Bamf, Aberden, and the chiefe places thereabouts, diligentlie to inquire of the
misdemeanor of those people. At what time she did temper the rigor of law with such courtesie, that she punished the offendors by fine, and not by death. From thence sh&eacute;e came to
Dund&eacute;e, and saint Iohns towne, obseruing the same cause and course of hir comming. When
she had thus passed ouer the summer in bringing the mounteine people to their dutie, she
sent the earle of Huntleie to ioine with the bishop of Rosse and Orkeneie, and to Hugh Kenedie; to whom she did substitute a better and more commodious forme of dispatch of their
affaires by others: who should receiue the libels and accusations of priuate persons, and diligentlie to inquire of them, in the townes of Inuernesse, Elgine, and other places. By whose
diligence it came to passe, that all those countries (being reduced to the rule of iustice) were
made the more quiet.</p>

whereby euerie mans substance should be put in an inuentarie, and according to the rate
thereof to paie a y&eacute;erelie taxation, to be put and kept in the treasure-house till warres began,
and that then men of warre might be waged, therewith to lie vpon the borders, and none
in that case to be charged to come from their owne houses, but when anie great armie came
foorth of England to inuade Scotland.</p>
<p>Diuerse of the great lords were agreed to this ordinance: but the most part of the barons
<note place="marg">This taxation is not granted.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1556.</date></note>
hearing thereof, assembled togither in Edenburgh, to the number of two hundred &amp; aboue,
and sent the lards Iames Sandlandie of Calder in Louthian, and Iohn of Wemis in Fife, to
the queene and lords, bes&eacute;eching them not to set such new taxations vpon them, for they could
not beare such burdens; but would defend the realme, as before time their elders had doone,
not meaning to put their goods in inuentarie, as if they should alreadie make their last will
and testaments: and be past all hope of inioieng their temporall goods, as persons not to liue
longer in the world, but to take their farewell, and giue ouer all that they had by law of fatall necessitie not to be auoided. * Adding further, that "their elders did not onelie defend
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. li.</emph> 16.</note>
themselues, and their goods against the English, when they were of farre greater power than
they now be; but did also manie times make further inuasion vpon them into their owne
countrie. For which cause, they being not anie iot now so degenerat from their ancestors,
that they wold not, when n&eacute;ed required, bestow their substance and life in defense of their
countrie.</p>
<p>"And as touching the hired souldiers, it was a thing full of danger, to commit the state
of Scotland to men without substance, or without hope of aduancement, and to such as for
monie will dare to doo anie thing, being a thing apt to kindle their d&eacute;epe couetousnesse,
and to minister occasion to them to attempt other matters. But to the end all other things
may the better be looked vnto, let them more remember the d&eacute;erenes of their countrie, than
their owne estate or condition. For will anie man beleeue, that hired souldiers will more valiantlie fight for strangers, than the owners will fight for the defense of their owne? That a
little hire or wages readie to be abated in peace, will greatlier incense the minds of the
common people; than goods, children, wiues, and temples, will mooue the hearts of the
nobilitie?</p>
<p>"Wherevnto may be ioined, that this matter perteineth to the highest good of the kingdome of Scotland, and that the same is of farre more importance than that it should be communed of at this time, and in the tender age of our yoong queene. Besides which the greater
part of men doo suspect and feare, that the same new order for warre is vnprofitable, and
such as cannot be performed without some commotion of the Scotish nation, especiallie sith
so great sums of more can hardlie be wroong out by tribute imposed on the same Scots,
as may suffice to nourish a hired armie to defend the borders. Wherefore it is to be feared,
least the end of persuasion grow to this point, that it doo not rather open a gap to let in
the enimie, than to be a barre to k&eacute;epe them backe. For if the English, after this example,
being a farre richer nation, shali gather a much greater summe: who doubteth, but that
they may with lesse trouble to the c&omacr;mon people, susteine an armie twise as great as that of

the Scots, &amp; such as shall not onelie enter the borders, but rush euen into the verie bowels
of the kingdome of Scotland?"</p>
<p>For the other part of the oration, I cannot tell whether it be better to suppresse it in silence, or to deliuer it (saith Buchanan) to common eies &amp; eares. For I doo heare (writeth he) manie which doo murmur and aske "who shall gather this monie? How much thereof
shall be necessarie to and for the hired souldiors, and how much to be left in the hands of
the treasuror? There be manie things which put vs in great hope, that no such thing shall be
established for the especiall goodnesse and temperancie of that woorthie princesse (in whose
hand the whole gouernment now resteth) dooth incourage vs, that we shall not b&eacute;e so taxed.
But yet when we remember the outward d&eacute;eds of others, and our owne at home, which haue
before time b&eacute;ene doone; we cannot so gouerne our selues, but that we must feare the
same hereafter to fall vpon vs, which we haue alreadie felt.</p>
<p>"But letting these things passe, which perchance we vainlie feare, let vs come to those
things in which our ancestors did place their chiefe helpe (for maintenance of their libertie)
against the weapons of their aduersaries. Robert the first of that name (in comparison of
whome none of the Scotish kings were counted more wise, and without all doubt none more
valiant, as we all confesse) did not onelie profit his subiects whilest he liued, but also after his
death: for when he laid at point to surrender his life, he gaue this admonition, that we should
neuer make continuall peace, nor long truce with the English. For that man (by nature and by
vse of long time exercised in both fortunes) did well perceiue, that such as liued in idlenesse and
slouth, had their stomachs and minds abated, and their bodies weakened with delights of pleasures, and that couetousnesse and lecherie did spring vp as it werein vntilled ground, when seuere
discipline and sparing was quenched, which made them also to be vnpatient of labor, and to hate
battell, whereby their strength being diminished, they should easilie giue place to their enimies."</p>
<p>After that these two noble men had said thus much, the regent fearing tumultuous insurrections if she perseuered in this exaction, left off anie further to pursue this tax, and is (in
often acknowledging hir error) said to haue vsed this sp&eacute;ech; That some of the best of the
Scots, and not she, were authors and workers of the same. By which words manie supposed that she ment the earle Huntleie, a man of a sharpe wit, latelie deliuered out of prison,
and rather readie to reuenge the iniurie receiued by restraint of his libertie, than mindfull of
anie benefit shewed vnto him in his deliuerance. Wherfore when he saw the regent bent to
this one thing to inure the Scots with taxes and paiments of monie: and fearing least hir
power being ouermuch increased, that she would abate the strength of the nobilitie, diminish their authoritie, and call the whole gouernment of Scotland into the hands of hir people, it was supposed that he gaue hir counsell answerable to hir disposition for the gathering
of monie which she had then in hand, being in d&eacute;ed the part of an enimie to hir, bicause
he knew that the Scots would not paie anie tribut, nor be so obedient vnto hir as they had
beene before. There were also some that supposed this deuise to grow from Dauid Painter
bishop of Rosse; for he being a man of rare wit, and no lesse learning, was with manie benefits tied to the Hamiltons, and was not anie waie estranged from their counsels and kinreds.</p>
<p>In this y&eacute;ere, an ambassador of Muscouie going into England with a great ship, &amp; another
<note place="marg"><date>1557.</date></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 328.</note>
bote, was cast on land by sudden tempest of the sea in the coast of Buchquane, a prouince in the north part of Scotland; who hauing lost all his goods by shipwracke, was
saued himselfe, and some of his companie, because they lighted on a rocke, where he &amp; they
might saue their liues. The inhabitants did liberallie interteine this strange man, and brought
him to Edenburgh to the queene, who would not permit this new ghest to want anie thing
so long as he remained with hir: and further commanded and procured, that his goods lost by
sea, and come into the hands of the people, should be faithfullie restored to him againe, appointing moreouer the lord Hume for honors sake to accompanie him to Berwike.</p>
<p>This y&eacute;ere also in the moneth of Iulie was Hoter Traberne sent ambassador (from Anna
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 529.</note>

to require that the ancient couenant of an hundred y&eacute;eres made betweene the Scots and
the people of Emden (which by course of some y&eacute;eres past, was now of no force) might
now againe be renewed. Which being granted &amp; solemnelie established, both those nations
from that day did liue togither in mutuall &amp; perfect friendship. After this, warres arising
betweene England and France, qu&eacute;ene Marie of England, fearing least the Scots would be
stirred at the motion of the French to attempt something against England, sent ambassadors to
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 529.</note>
the regent, to require that some of the Scots might with hir people m&eacute;et on the borders, to
treat of matters belonging vnto them both.</p>
<p>Wherevpon in the moneth of Iulie, the procurators for both the kingdomes met at Caerleill, whither for the Scots came Robert Reid bishop of Orkneie, Henrie Seintclere deane of
Glascow, Robert Carnegie knight, senators; and the lord Harries, at that time president of
the west borders. For the English did come Tunstall bishop of Durham, the lords Dacres,
and Wharton; amongst whome there was talke for peace, and recompense of such iniuries
as were committed by both the nations. In the meane time a certeine Frenchman landed
at the west part on Scotland, and declared to the qu&eacute;ene the warres betw&eacute;ene England and
France, desiring hir to make warre vpon the English. Wherevpon the qu&eacute;ene sent for the
<note place="marg"><date>1557.</date></note>

<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene regent desired warres.</note>
lords to commune with them at Newbottell, where she opened to them diuerse wrongs doone
on the borders by Englishmen, and how no redresse could be got: wherfore she required
that warres might be mooued against England in reuenge of those iniuries, although the
bishop of Orkeneie was the same time at Caerleill in talke with Cutbert Tunstall bishop of
<note place="marg">An assemblie at Caerleill.</note>

<note place="marg">The occasion why the qu&eacute;en rogent desired to haue war.</note>
Durham and others, commissioners for England. The principall cause that mooued the

Emperor in fauor of his sonne king Philip against the French king, bicause their qu&eacute;ene
had taken to husband the same king Philip, and sent the earle of Penbroke ouer with an
armie to ioine with king Philips power.</p>
<p>It was thought therefore, that if the Scots inuaded the English borders, it might cause
them to call backe their power foorth of France to defend their owne countrie. But the
Scotish lords would not consent in anie wise to begin anie warres: which their dealing when
<note place="marg">The Scotish lords refuse to take warre in hand.</note>

<note place="marg">Haimouth is fortified.</note>

<note place="marg">Inuasions are made into England.</note>
monsieur Doisell perceiued, h&eacute;e sp&eacute;edily went to Haimouth beside Berwike, and fortified
the same with all diligence, making inuasions into England. Wherevpon the Scotishmen in
their owne defense were constreined to make warre, and the erle of Huntleie was made
lieutenant vpon the borders, who came thither; and remaining there by the assistance of
the Frenchmen, made sundrie inuasions and rodes into England, burnt diuers townes and
villages, and cast downe manie stone houses, piles and strengths.</p>
<p>In this meane while were the Scotish commissioners at Caerleill; and the maister of Maxwell warden of the west borders, being there with them, with much adoo got away and
came home into Scotland. The qu&eacute;ene assembled a great armie out of all parts of the
<note place="marg">An armie assembled.</note>
realme, the which came forward to Kelso in the moneth of October, where the qu&eacute;ene &amp;
Frenchmen persuaded them to enter by inuasion into England. But they mening to take

<note place="marg">The castell of Warke besieged by the Scots.</note>

<note place="marg">Capteine Read.</note>
further aduise, passed ouer Tw&eacute;ed to Maxwell hugh, where they incamped, and afterward
approched the castell of Warke, inuironing the same with a siege for the space of two or
thr&eacute;e dais. Capteine Read at that present had charge of that castell, with thr&eacute;e or foure
hundred footmen, and one hundred horssemen, s&eacute;eming to care little for the Scotishmens
forces.</p>
<p>The earle of Westmerland, being then lieutenant of the north parts, gathered such power
<note place="marg">The earle of Westmerland gathereth an armie to resist the Scots.</note>
togither as he might make, and came to Lowike, accompanied with the lord Talbot, sir
Iames Crofts, and others, to succor where most n&eacute;ed should appeare. The Scotish armie,
perceiuing the Englishmen thus in a readinesse to resist their attempts, tooke aduise togither,
and concluded that it was not for the weale of the realme, at that time to hazard battell
foorth of the bounds of their owne land, their princesse being absent, and as yet in hir
minoritie; considering also that the war was not taken in hand for their owne quarell, but

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"for"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"581"</fw>-->

for the pleasure of France. These and other the like reasons, being alleged by the earles
of Arrane, Huntleie, Argile, Cassils, and others, to the queene and French capteins, they
<note place="marg">The Scots breake vp their armie.</note>
were nothing satisfied therewith; but the Scotish lords would attempt no further, but retired
backe and scaled their armie.</p>
<p>In remoouing from Warke, they were pursued by certeine bands of the borderers, and
others, which were repelled, and stood in danger to haue beeue distressed, if capteine Read
had not with noble corage issued foorth, and in time relieued them that were retiring:
whereby they staied and gaue a new charge, insomuch as the Scots were beaten backe againe,
and chased ouer the water to their maine armie that was alreadie passed ouer. The qu&eacute;ene and
monsieur Doisell, perceiuing that they could not get the Scotish lords to make anie further
exploit at that present, she retired home; but Doisell with his Frenchmen were appointed to
remaine still in Haimouth, to countergarrison the Englishmen within Berwike.</p>
<p>There were diuerse foot bands of Scots waged by the French king, which were appointed
to lie in places about the borders, as at Kelso, Rockesburgh, and such like for defense of
the countrie, and the annoiance of the Englishmen, as occasions might serue. After this,
sir Andrew Kar, and diuerse other entered England with a power of men about Martinmasse.
Neuerthelesse, the earle of Northumberland, being then lieutenant of the north parts of
England, and lieng on the borders, assembled his forces togither, &amp; comming to incounter
the Scots on the very borders side neere to Cheuiot, at the first the Englishmen were put
<note place="marg">The Scots discomfited by the earle of Northumberland.</note>
to the woorse, but vet at length the Scots were ouerthrowne and chased: sir Andrew Kar,
and manie other being taken prisoners.</p>
<p>Sir Iohn Forster bare himselfe verie valiantlie at this incounter, so that his seruice might
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn Forster.</note>
not well haue beene spared. He was thrust through the mouth into the necke, and also
through the thigh; morcouer, his horsse was slaine vnder him. The conflict was sharpe,
for both the horssemen and footmen came to make proofe of their forces. The warre thus
being begun and followed, the Scots kept their quarterrage, and euerie noble man (as he
<note place="marg">Quarterage kept by the Scots for defense of their borders.</note>
was appointed) laie on the borders with a thousand horssemen, during his ordinarie tearme.
And on the other side, the English borders were furnished with new supplies of men of
warre, so that there were dailie rodes and incursions made by the parties, to the great damage and spoile of the townes and villages situate n&eacute;ere to the confines of both the realmes.</p>
<p>In December the qu&eacute;ene assembled a parlement at Edenburgh, where sh&eacute;e (highlie

Wherevpon, sufficient commissions and instruments were made to them by the estates of the

great preparation made for the mariage, which was solemnized in Paris with great triumph

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 18<unclear></unclear>.</note>
councell-house of the French king: at what time the chancellor of France delt with them, that they
should represent the crowne and scepter, and other ornaments of the kingdome, to th' end
the husband of the yong queene might be crowned king also of Scotland. Wherevnto the
ambassadors did shortlie make answer, that they had no such thing giuen in charge to them.
After which, the cardinall said; "We desire nothing more at your hands at this time, but
that which lieth in your power to performe; which is, here now to confirme by writing
that you will hereafter, forward, approoue &amp; worke that this honor (which now we iustlie
demand) maie be granted to the Dolphin, when the same shall be talked of in the parlement of Scotland." Which request (when it s&eacute;emed full of impudencie) they supposed best
more constantlie and sharpelie to reiect.</p>
<p>Wherefore they answered, that "their ambassage was restreined within certeine bounds,
which they neither could nor would exc&eacute;ed. But and if they had beene sent with fr&eacute;e
libertie of their ambassage, that yet it were not the part of faithfull friends (as the
French professed to be) to required that which could not be granted without certeine and
assured danger and infamie of treason, though danger of lif were absent from it. All
which notwithstanding, in all honest things which might well be granted they would y&eacute;eld
vnto the French, ioined vnto them by so manie necessarie occasions. Wherefore they requested the French, that they would not in their demands exc&eacute;ed the limits of modestie."</p>
<p>Whervpon the ambassadors being dismissed from the court, foure of the chiefe of them
(before they departed home) which were these, Gilbert Kennedie, George Lesle, Robert
Read, and also lames Fleming, all men of singular vertue and loue to their countrie, besides
manie other of the companie, died there, not without mistrust of poison. It was also bel&eacute;eued, that lames the queenes brother had receiued the same draught: for (although he
were of a better composition of bodie, stronger constitution of complexion, and of more
youthfull strength, whereby he escaped death) he had alwaies after a continuall and dangerous infirmitie of his bellie whilest he liued, of the death of all which shall be somewhat
more said h&eacute;ereafter. Thus leauing the Scotish lords ambassadors there in France for a
time, we will returne to shew what happened betwixt the Scots and Englishmen at home,
where the warres were pursued, to the losse or little gaine of both parts.]</p>
<p>About Whitsuntide, sir Henrie Persie with diuerse bands of the countrie garrisons, &amp; sir
George Bowes then marshall of Berwike, with sundrie bands of the garrison of that towne,
passed foorth into Scotland, they being in all about seuen or eight hundred horssemen, and

<note place="marg">Duns and Langton burnt.</note>
two thousand footmen. They burnt the townes of Duns and Langton; and hauing got togither a great number of cattell, returned homewards. The Scots that laie in Kelso, and
other places, k&eacute;eping their quarterage on their borders (for the realme, as ye haue heard,
was quartered, euerie part k&eacute;eping their turne, as the manner is) assembled togither to the
number of two thousand horssemen (or few lesse) and three bands of footmen, hasting foorth
to defend the countrie. And perceiuing where the Englishmen were, followed and coasted
them as they returned with their bootie, till they came to Swinton, where they ouertooke
them, and skirmished with them sharpelie as they were passing through the towne.</p>
<p>The Scotish footmen beat backe part of the Englishmens shot into their battell, and preassed

verie forward in hope to be assisted by their horssemen, the which (as ye haue heard) ouermatched greatlie the English horssemen in number: but the fight grew somewhat hot, and the

to faile them, by reason the mistie morning had made much of their powder dankish, so
that they could haue no vse thereof. But h&eacute;erewith sir Henrie L&eacute;e, capteine Read, and

such conuenient time, as if the same had b&eacute;ene protracted, it might haue turned verie euill
to the English side.</p>
<p>But now as well the horssemen as footmen plaieng their parts, the Scotish horssemen
abiding without the towne in troope (while their footmen were in skirmish) fled awaie, 
<note place="marg">The Scots horssemen fl&eacute;e.</note>
leauing their footmen to be slaine and spoiled of the Englishmen, and yet those footmen fought
it out right manfullie: so that if the Scots horssemen had doone their parts so well as the
footmen, it was like to haue gone harder on the English side than it did. But now the
Scotish horssemen not entring the fight, their footmen were inclosed by the Englishmen:
for those that were in the fore-ward, and were passed by, returned, and comming behind
their enimies, holpe to beat them downe, so that few or none of the Scots or Frenchmen
<note place="marg">The Scots footmen slaine.</note>
(whereof there were some few amongest them) escaped, but were either taken or slaine.</p>
<p>Amongest others, capteine Cullane, and capteine Kenedie, two chiefe leaders of the footmen were taken: diuerse of their horssemen also in the retire were taken, amongest whome
<note place="marg">The lord of Keith with others taken prisoners.</note>
William lord Keith, sonne to the earle Marshall of Scotland was the chiefest. But this
victorie was not atchiued without losse of diuerse Englishmen. Amongest other one Pell,
ensigne-bearer to sir Iohn Markhams band of footmen was slaine. Also master Edrington
<note place="marg">M. Edrington taken.</note>
a capteine of light horssemen was taken prisoner by the lard of Edmonston, at the first
charge giuen vpon the Scotish horssemen, and led awaie without rescue. Beside the manfull
prowesse of sir Henrie Persie, and the other English capteins before mentioned, the forward
valiancie shewed that day of sir William Brereton, and Thomas Markham, that led his father
<note place="marg">Sir William Brereton.</note>
sir Iohn Markehams band of footmen, also of Rafe Ellerkar a capteine of horssemen, are
not to be forgotten, who with diuerse other capteins &amp; souldiers behaued themselues in such
wise at that present seruice, as their dealings therein deserue speciall memorie.</p>
<p>Moreouer, at an other time the Scots &amp; Frenchmen entring into England, the Scotish
horssemen, to the number of a thousand or thereabouts, passed foorth to burne and forraie
the countrie: but the earle of Northumberland, &amp; his brother sir Henrie Persie, assembled
togither a power of horssemen: and sir Henrie Persie m&eacute;eting with them at Grendor., set
<note place="marg">The Scots put to flight at Grendon.</note>
vpon the Scots and chased them ouer the water of Twisell, vnto the foot battell of the
Frenchmen: who retiring to the riuer of Tw&eacute;ed, passed ouer the same at Chapell Fourd,
where they were assailed both by certeine foot bands of the garrison of Berwike, that were
come foorth to aid the earle, and also by the horssemen: so as diuerse were drowned in
the riuer before they could get ouer.</p>
<p>But after they were once got to the further side, they put themselues in order of battell
againe, and retired in a squadron verie stronglie, susteining little or no hurt at all, notwithstanding that the erle of Northumberland (being then come) and his brother sir Henrie
Persic, with the rest of the capteins and gentlemen of the countrie, pursued them ouer
<note place="marg">The good order of the Frenchmen in their retire.</note>
the water for the space of two miles, skirmishing with them still as they marched awaie,
but could doo them no harme, because they kept themselues in so good order, &amp; the English footmen were not able to reach them. Wherevpon the English horssemen suffering
the Frenchmen to depart, left them, and passing into the countrie, burnt long Ednam, and
<note place="marg">L&omacr;g Ednam burnt.</note>
diuerse other hamlets and villages, and so returned. Diuerse Scots that day at the ouerthrow and chase of their horssemen were taken prisoners, as the lord Greie, and others.</p>
<note place="marg">The lord Greie of Scotland taken prisoner.</note>

<note place="marg">Cawmils woone by the Englishmen.</note>
<p>And after this, the Englishmen wan the strong pile of Cawmils, wherein were sixt&eacute;ene
Frenchmen that defended it for the time verie stoutlie, so that it cost the liues of diuerse
Englishmen, before they could take it. Shortlie after, there was a sore skirmish at Halidon
hill. For whereas the most part of summer it was ordeined, that euerie daie certeine bands
of souldiers should ward on the same hill, to giue libertie to the inhabitants of Berwike, to
mow and carie in their haie; they continued for a time without anie trouble offered by the
Scots or French, so that the warders standing in no doubt of the enimies, vsed out of their
armor to shoot, bowle, quait, &amp; exercise such like games of pleasure. Whereof the Scots
&amp; Frenchmen being aduertised, came one day from Aimouth in so secret wise, that they
were drawen verie n&eacute;ere to the Englishmen, yer they had anie warning of their approch.</p>

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"This"</fw>-->

<pb n="585"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"585"</fw>-->

<p>This approch as it was priuie, so was it likewise sudden, insomuch that before they
could be got into order, the Scots and Frenchmen were almost at their elbowes; and falling in skirmish with them, handled them verie roughlie: although sir William Brereton,
sir Iohn Markeham, maister William Drewrie, Cutbert Vaughan, and other the capteins of
<note place="marg">A sore skirmish vpon Halidon hill.</note>
the Englishmen did behaue themselues right manfullie, bringing their men in order, incouraging them, and dooing what apperteined vnto hardie and skilfull warriors. But yet
three times that day the Scots and Frenchmen put them from the higth of the hill, till at
length sir Iames Croft comming from Berwike, vsed such diligence and policie in the matter,
that the Scots and Frenchmen were repelled and constreined to retire, withdrawing backe
into Aimouth, after they had continued in skirmish from one of the clocke till it was past
foure with no small losse on both parts.</p>
<p>After this, the earle of Bothwell, lieng on the borders as lieutenant, according to the order
<note place="marg">The earle of Bothwell.</note>
for the time of his quarterage, entred on a day into England, and sent his forraie to burne
Fenton towne, k&eacute;eping himselfe in ambush at Haltwell Sweire. Sir Henrie Persie aduertised that the Scots were thus entred, got togither a thousand horsse, and making foorth
to defend the countrie, set vpon the earle at the aforesaid place of Haltwell Sweire; but
<note place="marg">Haltwell Sweire.</note>
some fear&eacute; entring into the hearts of the Englishmen, by reason of certeine shot which the
Scots had there with them, fled, and were pursued by the Scots ouer the water of Till.
There were taken aboue six score Englishmen, amongst whom capteine Erington, and 
<note place="marg">The Englishmen put to flight.</note>
capteine Kar, that had the leading of light horssemen, were two: beside diuerse other men of
good account in seruice, as one Vaughan a gentleman and such like.</p>
<p>About this time, whilest the lord Eure commonlie called Euers, remained capteine of
Berwike, one Kirkaudie cousine to sir William Kirkaudie lard of Grange, chanced to be
taken prisoner into Berwike; and afterwerds being ransomed, at his comming home to
Aimouth, he made report that he had beene too streictlie vsed, during the time that he remained prisoner, at the hands of the said lord Eure. By reason wherof, vpon chalenge
<note place="marg">The lard of Grange chall&emacr;geth the lord Eure.</note>
made by Grauge to fight a combat with the lord Eure, the matter grew to this issue; that
where their degr&eacute;es were not equall, Rafe Eure brother to the lord Eure vndertooke (in his
brothers behalfe) to breake a staffe with the lard of Grange vpon the side of Halidon hill
at a day appointed: where they met, either of them bringing twelue gentlemen with them,
to s&eacute;e the triall of this chalenge performed.</p>
<p>But when they came to haue their armor &amp; weapons viewed, the truth is so, that Grange
was armed in a cote of plate, and a curace aloft vpon it: wherewith some fault was found, because maister Eure was clad onelie in a single cote of plate, without anie other p&eacute;eces of armor
for defense of his bodie. But yet such was the great courage of the said maister Eure, that he
<note place="marg">The lard of Grange and maister Rafe Eure ran one against another.</note>
would not refuse the chalenge, notwithstanding his aduersaries aduantage of armor. Wherevpon they ran togither, and brake both their staues; and as it fortuned maister Eure was
hurt in the flauke. The warre being thus pursued betwixt England and Scotland, beside
the incounters and roads which are before mentioned, there were two great roads made
into Scotland; the one by the earle of Westmerland, and the other by the earle of Northumberland: the lord Talbot being there, &amp; hauing the leading of certeine demilances.</p>
<p>Moreouer, it was thought good by the Englishmen, not onelie to annoie the Scots by land,
but also by sea. Wherevpon sir Iohn Clere with certeine ships of warre sailed foorth
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn Clere slaine in the Ile of Orkeneie.</note>
alongest the coast, till at length he arriued at the Iles of Orkeneie; where going on land
about an enterprise, &amp; staieng longer than was requisit, he was incountred by his aduersaries,
and slaine with manie of his people, which were there on land with him. But though the
Scots had good successe in that part, they susteined great damage on the west side of the
realme, by a iournie which the erle of Sussex then lord deputie of Ireland attempted against
them. For the better vnderstanding whereof ye shall note, that after the lord Clinton high
admerall of England had burnt the towne of Conquest in Britaine, there were seuen ships
of warre appointed to passe into Ireland, as the Marie Willoughbie, the New barke, the

<!--<fw place="top-left">"586"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

Sacret, the Gerfalcon, and thr&eacute;e other that were merchants, and appointed that yeare to serue
the qu&eacute;ene of England in hir warres.</p>
<p>There were also beside those seuen ships of war, two vittellers appointed to attend vpon
them. Sir Thomas Cotton was ordeined their admerall, and one Southweke of Douer was
assigned to be their viceadmerall. Now vpon their arriuall in Ireland, the earle of Sussex
<note place="marg">The iournie of the earle of Sussex into the west parts of Scotland.</note>
hauing also prepared thr&eacute;e other ships, with sufficient and necessarie prouision for his
iourneie, imbarked with so manie souldiers as conuenientlie might be bestowed aboord in
that fl&eacute;et, conteining twelue saile in the whole; and departing toward the west of Scotland,
landed in a part of the countrie called Kentire, with as manie souldiers and mariners as might
<note place="marg">Kentire.</note>
be spared out of the ships, leauing them furnishd with competent numbers for their safegard; and being got to land, he passed foorth into the countrie, &amp; burnt two houses that
belonged to lames Maconell chiefe gouernor of those parts, &amp; a great enimie to the 
<note place="marg">Iames Maconell.</note>
Englishmen.</p>
<p>He burnt also diuerse townes, villages, and hamlets belonging vnto the said Maconell,
with great store of come and other things which came in their waie. The Scots oftentimes
skirmished with the Englishmen, but durst not aduenture to ioine with them in battell, they
kept so good order by the earle of Sussex his politike and valiant conduction. There were
a sort of Scots gotten into a boate meaning to haue fled, but being apprehended by the Englishmen, they were executed. Finallie, after the earle had remained there on land, in burning and spoiling the countrie for the space of thr&eacute;e daies, he returned to his ships, and in
safetie went aboord againe with his men: and making saile to the Ile of Arrane, entred the
<note place="marg">The earle of Sussex burnt the Ile of Arrane.</note>
hauen called Amalasche, and landing at that place, burnt the countrie, and after went to
Cumber, where he likewise burnt and harried that Ile.</p>
<p>This doone, he meant to haue gone into two other Ilands, Ila and Iureie: but the winds
grew so terrible with tempests and foule weather, that they lost one of their ships; and
<note place="marg">Foule weather.</note>
some of the rest were so rent &amp; spoiled of their tackle and furniture, as they escaped in
great hazard of being cast awaie also. There were six and twentie mariners drowned, the
which perceiuing the ship to be in danger of sinking, fled into the boate, and so perished:
the other that remained in the ship were saued, as maister Francis Randoll, and others. By
reason therefore of such foule weather, the earle of Sussex was constreined to returne into
Ireland, arriuing in Cragfergus, where he landed with his souldiers: and appointing the
<note place="marg">The earle of Sussex returneth into Ireland.</note>
ships to returne into England, he passed by land vnto Dublim, spoiling the enimies countries
by the waie, and taking from them a great preie and bootie of cattell; notwithstanding the
painfull passage that he had to make through the cumbersome waies, bogs, and woods,
without reliefe of all necessarie things in that so troublesome a iournie.</p>
<p>Thus far for those yeares warre in the daies of Marie qu&eacute;ene of England, betwixt the
Englishmen and Scots: whereof sith I haue found none that hath written anie thing at all,
I haue yet set downe these od notes, as I haue learned the same of such as had good cause
to know the truth thereof, being eie-witnesses themselues of such enterprises and exploits
as chanced in the same warres; namelie capteine Read, capteine Wood, capteine Erington,
capteine Gurleie, and capteine Markham; with others, which of their courtesie haue willinglie
imparted to me the report of diuerse such things, as I wisht to be resolued in. Which
accordinglie (so far as my remembrance hath serued) I haue here deliuered, to the end the
same maie giue occasion to others (that maie happilie light vpon more full instructions) to
impart to posteritie a more perfect discourse, where otherwise the matter might peraduenture
wholie passe in forgetfulnesse.</p>
<p>And now to returne vnto the Scotish ambassadors that were sent into France, for the
conclus on of the marriage betwixt their qu&eacute;ene &amp; the Dolphin. After that the same mariage
was consummat, and euerie thing ordered and brought to passe according to the effect of
their commission; in the moneth of August they tooke their leaue of the French king,

foorthwith giue vnto the cardinall Guise: long after which followed also the death of the abbat of Bamtorinoch. At this verie time manie prodigious sights (which I will not here recite,
being touched by Lesleus) did appeare by a marker of such ominous things, whereof these
verses were made:
<quote rend="block"><lg lang="la">
<l>Portentum est miser&aelig; gentis, qu&aelig; numine I&aelig;so</l>

<p>In September there was a parlement holden at Edenburgh, in which the acts of the former
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 542.</note>
legats in France (about the mariage of the queene of Scots to the Dolphin) were confirmed.
At what time the Dolphin of France by his ambassadors did vehementlie request, that the
crowne (which they terme matrimoniall) should be giuen vnto him by the decr&eacute;e of the
states, whereby he might be called king of Scotland as long as the qu&eacute;ene liued. The qu&eacute;ene
also iudging it a point of honor, to heape all title of glorie which she could vpon hir husband, as
one that by a certeine inclination of mind did vertuouslie fauor him; gaue in charge also to the
ambasadors, that they should earnestlie follow the same cause amongest the Scots. And to
the end to draw them the more easilie into hir opinion; she drew the matter into certeine
articles, deliuered to the ambassadors with more ample instructions touching the same: the
summe of all which was this.</p>
<p>First, diligentie to beat into the Scots with what disposition of mind the Dolphin was affected toward them, as well as his father, who held the Scots in that account as he did his
owne people, and so alwaies would haue them: which good mind of the French towards the
Scots to be plaine without anie dissimulation, it maie well appeere as well by the couenants established for the mariage, as also by the benefits which he hath not onelie bestowed vpon the
Scots and Scotland in generalitie, but also in particularitie vpon certeine especiall Scots, of his
owne fr&eacute;e will, almost without the request of anie bodie. And that they should further laie
abroad, what helpe the qu&eacute;ene and Scots haue had of the woorthie cardinall of Lorraine, &amp;
the duke of Guise the qu&eacute;enes vncle. All which the ambassadors themselues (as they haue
fullie proued) did well vnderstand.</p>
<p>Secondlie, where the qu&eacute;ene dooth thinke that she is greatlie benefited with manie honors
by so great a king, but especiallie in this, that so mightie a prince hath taken hir into the
fellowship of the holie bed, by which there can not anie other commoditie grow to the
king than the reuenues of the kingdome which he hath purchased with his great charge
and labor: and that the qu&eacute;ene considering all this (with great griefe of mind) dooth s&eacute;eke by
what meanes she might at least expresse some small token of a thankefull mind for so manie
benefits (because if she should not doo some thing, no small blot would s&eacute;eme to be imputed to the queene and the Scots) it came into hir mind to thinke by what meanes she could
requite some part therof, which she could doo (as she thought) if at the least she did but

<!--<fw place="bot-center">"4 F 2"</fw>--><!--<fw place="bot-right">"honor"</fw>-->

<pb n="588"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"588"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

honor hir husband with the kinglie title, &amp; giue vnto him the mariage crowne of Scotland.</p>
<p>This thing therefore the qu&eacute;ene hir selfe dooth earnestlie desire, and dooth courteouslie
request all the estates of Scotland, that the same maie be established by the voices of the
full parlement, and that they will command some thr&eacute;e or foure of the chiefest nobilitie honorablie to carie the ensignes of the kingdome to him, that at the least by this token of
loue, the king &amp; the best of the court maie well perceiue, with what reuerence and with
what dutie they fauour the king hir husband.</p>
<p>And to the end that this request of the qu&eacute;ene, for the rarenesse of the example, should
not br&eacute;ed anie doubt in the mind of the nobilitie, and to hold them as it were in suspense,
it was giuen in charge also to the ambassadors, that they should in manner point with their
finger, that manie ages past, the qu&eacute;ene of Naples did not onelie for loue she did beare vnto
him, adorne the duke of Aniou hir husband, with the bare name of a king; but did also
by the consent of the nobilitie, giue him rule and gouernement ouer the same kingdome.
The like whereof was also doone in our memorie by the queene of Spaine to hir husband
the archduke of Austrich, &amp; by the queene of Nauarre to the duke of Vandosme.</p>
<p>But if that the Scots be mooued by the example of the English, who haue excluded Philip
king of Spaine, that then the ambassadors should easilie wipe awaie that doubt, if they admonish the Scots that the English are not tied to the Spaniards with that firme and n&eacute;edfull
band as the Scots are to the French, both which nations haue one priuilege, magistrats to gouerne, and one fellowship and participation of the administration of all the things in either
kingdome. Wherevnto they must further adde that it was so far off, that the English
should reape anie fruit or commoditie by the Spaniards, that the king of Spaine himselfe did
(as it were) wring from the English all the commoditie he could, to performe his affaires
out of the realme. And further, that the English being out of all hope for their queene to
haue anie issue by the same mariage, they would not grant vnto it, when there is a certeine
and full hope left to the Scots, that issue may come of this marriage.</p>
<p>Besides all this, let it be opened vnto the Scots, what great benefit maie redound vnto
them by this signe of a thankefull mind. For it maie so happen, that if the king Dolphin
shall f&eacute;ele himselfe increased with this title of honor by the Scots, as a note of their good
<note place="marg">Well fished to catch a frog.</note>

<note place="marg">Not so likelie as that lies drop out of your pen.</note>
fauour to him, that he maie raise vp his father the king of France, that he will not by anie
meanes permit the qu&eacute;ene of Scots his wife to be excluded from the kingdome of England,
after the death of qu&eacute;ene Marie, who was not like to liue long being sore troubled with the
dropsie.</p>
<p>These things and manie others were giuen in charge to the ambassadors (comen out of
France) to declare to the parlement of Scotland. Which being thus declared to the states
and the qu&eacute;ene regent, with might and maine s&eacute;eking the furthering thereof; at length it
was granted that he should be king during the life of the qu&eacute;ene. For which cause Gillesper Campbell earle of Argile, and lames Steward, bastard brother to the yoong qu&eacute;ene,
being prior of S. Andrews, were named to execute their consent vnto the Dolphin to declare him king, and to inuest him with the ornaments there to belonging, and further to shew
the readie minds of the Scots toward him, not onlie in this but in all other things: by
which anie honor or profit might anie waie rise vnto him.</p>
<p>But whilest these men doo prepare all things for such a iourneie, certeine factious persons did beat into their earcs, how heauie a iournie that would bee vnto them. For it would
happen, that whilest they were busie in prouiding for small things abrode, they should by
delaie corrupt, or by absence cleane ouerturne matters of greater importance at home. For
they did know how the subtill wit of lames, and the great power and strength of the earle
of Argile would be missing in those new things which were in hand amongst these of the religion: for which they neuer left off intreating and persuading, vntill they had wholie staied
them from that iournie.</p>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"589"</fw>-->

<p>During these affaires, Marie qu&eacute;ene of England died, and that woorthie ladie Elizabeth
<note place="marg"><emph>Buch. lib.</emph> 10.</note>
succeeded in hir place. Immediatlie wherevpon, the yoong qu&eacute;ene of Scots bare hir selfe as
heire to that kingdome, and caused all hir hangings, bedding, vessels and other houshold
stuffe to be stamped and marked with the title and armes of the kings of England. And
although France were then miserablie afflicted in chalenging the dominion and gouernment
of Millane, Naples, and Flanders; yet they would needes heape euill vpon euill, and adde
therevnto the title of England, as being vnto them a verie scorne and mockerie (as Buchanan tearmeth it.) Neither did the wiser sort of the French looke into that matter: for
the Guises, who at that time gouerned all things, did consent to this error of the Scotish
qu&eacute;ene, bicause they would thereby s&eacute;eme to haue gotten to themselues a singular honor in
adding the title of England to the French name.</p>
<p>The regent hauing now gotten a consent (as before you haue heard) of the matrimoniall
crowne to be bestowed vpon the husband of the yoong qu&eacute;ene of Scots, began after a sort to
put on a new mind: for by little and little she conuerted that old and accepted courtesie,
into commanding arrogancie; and the gentle answers wherewith she was woont to appease
all parts, were turned contrarie. Which before she durst not doo by reason of the present
state, which then was such, as she feared not to promise what she would not haue to be
performed, bicause she had not then obteind the grant of the matrimoniall crowne: but now
hauing all things after hir owne mind, she vsed other conditions, and other sp&eacute;ches. There
was also a parlement appointed at Striueling in the sixt Ides of Maie.</p>
<p>And bicause she was heard oftentimes to saie, that she would not suffer the maiestie of
the chiefe gouernement to be cast downe from the seat thereof, but wold restore it to the
former place. By which saiengs manie were admonished of some troublesome tempest to follow.
Wherevpon diuerse came to intreat hir for the protestants, amongest which for the dignitie
of his name, to make the matter to be more easilie obteined, there were sent Alexander Cunigame earle of Glencarne, and Hugh Campbell shiriffe of Aine, a woorthie knight, before
whom the regent could not refraine hirselfe, but burst foorth into these woords.</p>
<p>"These men (saith shee) sith they haue preached not verie sincerelie, shall be banished,
though you and your ministers resist against it." And when they replied, bes&eacute;eching hir
that she would remember what she had often promised: she answered, that the performance of promise is to b&eacute;e chalenged of princes, so farre as it s&eacute;emeth commodious for them
to performe it. Wherevnto they replied, that they therefore renounced all dutie and obedience vnto hir, and did further forewarne hir of the great mischiefes that would flow out of
this founteine: with which answer sh&eacute;e being stroken more than sh&eacute;e looked for, said in the
end, that she would both thinke on it and them.)</p>
<p>In lulie and August, there was a conuention of all the prelats and cleargie holden at 
<note place="marg">An assemblie of the cleargie.</note>

the lord Seiton was made gouernor there.] In this assemblie it was required, that the

that Scotland did flame in euerie part with tumults and seditions, it is strange to s&eacute;e how
greatlie I was astonied thereat. But when I heard that you (to whome my dead father, my

liberallie bestowed, and become the author, head, and nourisher of this fire of contention and
bralles; I could not be persuaded that you would so farre digresse from that office and dutie of pietie, which you haue alwaies made shew to beare vnto the qu&eacute;ene.</p>
<p>But if the thing were so, as the common fame dooth report of you, I did verelie thinke
that the promises and flattering woords of others had intised you to this deceipt, onelie to

<p>Iames Steward the prior of saint Andrewes (whome prosperous successes had before aduanced) did in reading these letters of the king and qu&eacute;ene so fric in anger and hatred,
that he could not forbeare but must needes returne answer, expressing the same (after confirmed by his deedes) though now somewhat smoothed with good woords. The effect of
which letters were in this sort: "That he was grieued in his mind as much as he might, because he was so farre fallen into the mislike and displeasure of those princes, whome he
reuerenced with great dutie, that they should bitterlie obiect vnto him in their letters that
he was a seditious person, noted of ingratitude, fraught with malice, and defiled with
heresie.</p>
<p>"Touching which notes of these wickednes, sith they were imputed to him by the nobilitie of Scotland (meaning such as stood against the reformed religion) he with faire sp&eacute;eches
requested the princes, that they would not attribute more to the malice of his enimies in accusing him, than to his vprightnes in purging himselfe : and that they should not thinke anie
thing to be spoken by his enimies, but that which fauoured of malice, enuie, and hatred, especiallie sith they did not onelie go about to diminish his fame abroad amongest the princes,
but also at home did openlie laie wait for his life and liuing.</p>
<p>"But he would so labor, that all men should well perceiue his good mind (towards the
princes) fullie laied abroad without anie veile of dissimulation, whereby his aduersaries should
be ashamed to haue laied such open reproch against him, and the king &amp; queene should mislike that they had so easilie credited his enimies. Wherefore he desired that hereafter they
should rather beleeue anie thing of him, than that he would be noted for an vnthankefull
man, as they had obiected vnto him. From the detestable spot whereof (being of all
the verie woorst, sith nature abhorreth the same) he would k&eacute;epe himselfe, and rather die
by anie kind of torment, than to suffer the least spot of such a vice to dwell in his name, especiallie in the affaires of that king and qu&eacute;ene, whereof he had found the first most courteous, and the second most bountifull.</p>
<p>"And therefore, as he had with all dutie hitherto prosecuted their fauour, so he would
(during his life) contend, that his trauell, diligence, and faith, should neuer want in performing or defending their affaires, so that they would not burthen him with that which might be
a detriment to the cause of God and religion: for if either of them were in hand, neither
the fraudulent counsels of his striuing aduersaries, neither the bitter woords of the sharpe
threats of the king or qu&eacute;ene, should make him leaue off, or represse their woorthie force
in taking vpon him the defense of those things.</p>

thing (sith he supposeth the honor of God, the glorie of the king and qu&eacute;ene, and the helpe

<p>Crookes had scarse performed his ambassage for which he came (as before you haue
heard) in deliuering these letters: but foorthwith alanded at Leith Octauian a Frenchman,
with foure troops of souldiers, with a great masse of monie, &amp; other furniture needfull for
the warres: whome after a few daies the regent sent backe againe into France, to require
of the king, that foure other companies of souldiers might be sent ouer, which might with
those (alreadie now in Scotland) supplie the number of twentie ensignes: to whome also
it were expedient to ioine a hundred horsmen, which number she affirmed would suffice
to pacifie all the tumults in Scotland, so that foure ships well appointed might alwaies lie
in the hauen of Leith, to watch the port. Of all which if the Scots were prouided (by
the benefit of the king) and that the comming of hir brother the marquesse of Albufe
were hastened, she promised then to bring all things to an end.</p>
<p>Besides which, she did also signifie vnto the king, that the Scots of the reformed religion,
for the increase of their faction, had secretlie growen in league with some of the nobilitie
of France, who did dailiesend letters and messengers to the Scots, to incourage them not
to leaue off from their attempts; promising also vnto them that they would hinder (by all
the meanes they could) that no great armie should be made out of France against them:
and moreouer, in that the Scots had sent ambassadors to Germanie, and into Denmarke,
for religions cause, to require aid from thence, but their chiefest and principall hope did rest
(as saith Lesleus) in England.]</p>
<p>During these things, the duke of Chatelerault and the lords of the congregation sent to
<note place="marg"><date>1559.</date></note>
the que';ene (whereof we will speake more h&eacute;ereafter) beseeching hir to leaue off from making of forts within the realme. But she would not grant so to doo: wherfore they assembled their whole forces in Edenburgh, and besieged the towne of Leith in October: the
<note place="marg">Leith besieged.</note>
qu&eacute;ene and Frenchmen, with the bishops of saint Andrews, Glascow, Dunfreis, the lord
of Seton, and diuerse other Scotishmen being within it. But the Frenchmen of warre
issued foorth of Leith, and met n&eacute;ere to the abbeie of Holie rood house, with the Scotish
lords and their companie, where manie Scotishmen were slaine, &amp; the rest chased into

those within the castell had not shot off the artillerie at them, to staie the slaughter and

<p>In the time of this siege, the yoong lard of Lethington, secretarie to the qu&eacute;ene, being
with hir in Leith, left the towne, &amp; secretlie departing, got him to the lords, and holpe
greatlie afterwards to obteine aid out of England. After this, the qu&eacute;ene and Frenchmen
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene came to Edenburgh.</note>
came to Edenburgh, which was peaceablie rendred to them, where they remained all that

of the French armie, monsieur Martigues coronell of the footmen. And with them came

assembled at Edenburgh, of whome there was a day required of hearing to be giuen to la
Brosse, and to the bishop, affirming that they were sent thither as ambassadors. To whome
it was answered, that "they did not s&eacute;eke peace (as they did dissemble) but threaten war:
for otherwise to what end were it to bring armed soldiers to dispute thereof? For the Scots
were not so ignorant of the state of things, that they would commit them selues to that

deciding of matters, in which they might be compelled to accept conditions answerable to the
mind of the aduersarie. But if amnongest weapons it pleased them to make peace, they
would also prouide, that they would not rather s&eacute;eme to be drawne therevnto by compulsion,
than quietlie led by reason. For if they did trulie &amp; from their heart require that d&eacute;ed
which they s&eacute;eme in woords, they would discharge those strange souldiers, and m&eacute;et (as
they haue often doone in other places) vnarmed, as to a thing that by woords and reason
is to be decided, and not by swoords the strength to be compassed." And thus much for
the ambassadors.</p>
<p>Now you haue heard before of the battell of Leith, the besieging and the regaining of
Edenburgh; touching which, because it is omitted before in the reciting of the things doone
in those places, I thinke it not amisse (though it come a little out of course) to set it downe
(as Buchanan hath placed the same) next after the sp&eacute;eches vsed to those ambassadors.
Thus therefore he writeth touching the defense of Leith. These noble men (meaning those
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 16.</note>
at Edenburgh) did write to the queene much after this maner, "That they did greatlie maruell, that the regent prouoked with no iniuries, did so soone depart from the former conenants; and expelling the ancient inhabitants of Leith, and placing there a colonie of
strangers, she would in that place build a castle to the destruction of the lawes and liberties
of the realme, and to the danger of the liues of them all. Wherefore they did earnestlie
intreat hir, that she would desist from this thing rashlie attempted (against the faith of hir
promise, the publike commoditie, and the laws and liberties of the kingdome) least she inforce them by necessitie to praie in aid of the whole people.</p>
<p>"Besides which also, they which were assembled at Edenburgh, did write to the same
effect, about a moneth after that they had dispatched the other letters, adding these petitions
to the same last letters; That ouerthrowing the new fortresses, she would command all the
strangers and hired people to depart out of the towne, to the end that it might be fr&eacute;e for
all men (according to iustice) there to traffike and vse their mutuall trade of buieng &amp;
selling one with an other. The which if she refused to doo, they would take it for a sure
token, that she ment to bring this kingdome into seruitude; against which euill they would
prouide all whatsoeuer remedie that they could. Within thr&eacute;e daies after, the qu&eacute;ene sent
Robert Forman chiefe herald to answer the matter, with instructions and commandements
deliuered to him in these words.</p>
<p>"First of all, you shall shew vnto them, that nothing could happen vnto vs more contnarie to our opinion, than that there should be anie other hauing authoritie here, besides
my daughter and hir husband my sonne in law, vpon whome all our authoritie dooth depend ; that the former acts of the nobilitie, and this present request, or rather commandement dooth well declare, that they acknowledge no other superioritie; and that their demands (or rather threatnings) with what shew of words soeuer they be cloked, are sufflcientlie enough knowen vnto vs, as no new things. Againe, you shall require of the duke
of Chastelerault, that he call to mind what he hath promised to vs by his words, and to
the king by his letters. Which was, that he would not onelie hearken to the kings commandement; but also woorke, that his sonne the earle of Arrane should not at all ioine
with those tumults of the countrie, and whether the things which he now dooth, are the performance of his promises.</p>
<p>"To their letters also you shall answer; that we haue openlie shewed our indeuor to
bring things to quiet; that we will grant to anie thing, which maie not resist the pietie due
to God, and dooth not fight with their duetie towards their king and qu&eacute;ene, and that I
did nouer so much as once thinke of the ouerthrow of their lawes and liberties; and much
lesse, somuch as dreame of conquering the kingdome by violence. For to whome, or for
whome should I s&eacute;eke the kingdome, when my daughter dooth alreadie possesse it? Touching the defense and fortifieng of Leith, you shall aske them this; whether that we at anie
time haue attempted anie thing that waie, before that they with manie assemblies, and at
length with conspiracie among themselues, did openlie shew that they would shake off the

lawfull gouernement, and before that they at their pleasure troubled the whole publike
state (vnknowledge to vs, who held the place and authoritie of the chiefest gouernor)
strengthened their factions with strong cities, and made league and couenants with our ancient enimies?</p>
<p>"And to omit other things, what cause can they (in the end) bring foorth, whie it was
lawfull for them to reteine an armie at Edenburgh, to inuade the gouernors of those affaires?
And that it is not lawfull for vs at Leith for our owne defense and safetie, to haue anie
other gard about vs? Truelie they s&eacute;eke this therin, that we should labor to shun their
furie (as hitherto we haue doone) by continuall and dailie change of places. Is there anie
thing in their letters that mentioned their dutie to the right magistrate? Dooth there lie
open anie waie for the restoring of concord? Or doo they shew anie token that they would
haue these seditions pacified, and that they would all things should be reduced to their
former state?</p>
<p>"Let them cloke this with what colour they will of publike commoditie; yet it is manifest that they thinke and seeke nothing lesse. For if they had onelie staied vpon a concord,
we haue often shewed them a waie therevnto. Neither are they ignorant that these French
had (by the commandement of their king) b&eacute;ene long before dispatched out of Scotland,
vnlesse their dooings had b&eacute;ene the cause of their staie. Wherefore, if they will yet now
offer anie honest conditions which may induce vs to hope; and that (the maiestie of the
gouernement alwaies saued sound) maie declare that they will modestlie and obedientlie
obeie their superiors: we will refuse no means to restore a concord &amp; quiet amongest them
and vs, nor omit anie thing that maie tend to the publike commoditie.</p>
<p>"Neither are we alone so affected towards them, but also their king and qu&eacute;ene; who
hath sent vnto them a woorthie knight of the order of the scallop shell, and one of the
chiefe of the ecclesiasticall order, with letters and commandements touching the same:
whome they did so contemne, as that they would not vouchsafe them answer, no not so
much as haring. Wherefore, ye shall demand, and command the duke, the nobilitie,
and all others of what condition soeuer, that they depart in sunder; or otherwise, that they
shall not be kept togither, vnlesse it be by strength of armes." To all this the next day,
which was the thr&eacute;e and twentith of October, the nobilitie answered after this order.</p>
<p>"We easilie vnderstand by your letters and commandements sent by the herald, how
obstinatlie you be euillie minded against pietie towards God, the publike commoditie of
the realme, and the common libertie of vs all: all which things we must &amp; doo defend, as
of right we ought. Wherefore, from hencefoorth we doo suspend and forbid your gouernement, in the name of the king and qu&eacute;ene, or by what other name or title you doo
vsurpe the publike administration of the kingdome; as persons certeinlie knowing, that
those things which are now doone by you, doo with the mind of those princes fight against
the publike safetie of this realme.</p>
<p>"And as you doo not est&eacute;eme vs lawfull subiects of those princes &amp; of this kingdome,
to make a publike senate or councell: so we doo not acknowledge you for a regent to
execute supreme authoritie; speciallie sith the gouernement (if you haue anie such committed vnto you by the princes) is for most iust &amp; weightie causes forbidden you: and that
in the name of the same princes, whose councellors we are borne to be, chiefelie in matters
which perteine to the safetie of all the people. And although we haue determined not to
flee anie danger, in deliuering of that towne, in which you haue placed strange and hired
souldiers against vs: yet for the reuerence which we beare vnto you, as vnto our qu&eacute;ene
mother; we earnestlie with all faithfull intreatie bes&eacute;ech you, that you depart from thence;
whilest the cause of publike commoditie dooth inforce vs to recouer that towne by weapons.</p>
<p>"Besides which, we further request, that you will leade them out of the towne with you;
within foure and twentie houres; if there be anie which doo challenge vnto themselues the
names of ambassadors, either to decide controuersies, or to gouerne the affaires. For it is

but equitie that we prouide for the safetie, and willinglie spare the bloud of all those hired
souldiers, aswell for the ancient amitie which hath b&eacute;ene betw&eacute;ene the French and the Scots,
as for the mariage of our qu&eacute;ene with their king: which friendship we would rather should
be increased than diminished. The same day also, the said herald declared at his returne
to the regent, that the day before it was persuaded in an assembled councell of the nobles
and the other commons; that all the d&eacute;eds and saiengs of the regent did onelie tend to
verie tyrannie.</p>
<p>"Herevpon, there was a decree made to take the gouernement from hir: so that the
whole companie subscribed, as to a most iust matter: and that there they did forbid anie
ambassage, giuen or sent to hir by hir sonne in law and hir daughter: further, commanding
hir to execute no gouernement, vntill the generall assemblie of a parlement to be appointed
by them in such place as they should thinke conuenient. The fiue and twentith daie, the
lords of the religion sent an herald to Leith, to will all the Scots to depart the towne within
foure and twentie houres, and to separat themselues from the subuerters of publike libertie.
Thus much Buchanan of this doone about the state of Leith, before the nobilitie besieged
the same (as is before set downe.) And so againe to the order of the historie.]</p>
<p>The lords of Scotland, perceiuing the Frenchmen incresed, so that they by their owne forces

onlie were not able to resist them, sent William Metellan to Elizabeth the qu&eacute;ene of England for assistance, to expell the Frenchmen. Which the queene of England granted, not
onelie for to serue the Scotishmens turne; but speciallie for the suertie of hir owne realme
and state, which as then was thought to stand in danger of trouble, in case the Frenchmen
were suffered to remaine in Scotland: considering the euill dealing of the French king and
his councell in some points alreadie shewed. The queene of England therefore sent the

<p>And for sure k&eacute;eping hereof, the Scotish lords deliuered pledges into England, there to
remaine during the life of the king of France, and one y&eacute;ere after his deceasse. The pledges
were these: Dauid Hamilton, sonne to the duke of Chatelerault; an other called Colme
Campbell, cousine to the earle of Argile; Robert Dowglas, brother to the prior of S. Andrews; and the lard of Lochieuin, and a sonne of the lord Ruthwen. About the same

time, lames Hamilton earle of Arrane, eldest sonne to the duke of Chatelerault, and capteine
of the Scotish companie of men of armes and archers in France, being fled for religion
secretlie to Geneua, from thence came by the conuoie of maister Randall Englishman into
England: which at his comming into Scotland he performed, and ioined himselfe with the
earle of Argile, and other lords in the cause aforesaid.</p>
<p>The duke of Chatelerault, the earles of Argile, Arrane, and others, came to the towne of
Glascow, and caused the images &amp; altars to be taken downe, seizing the bishops liuing into
<note place="marg">The towne of Glascow is taken.</note>
their hands, and tooke the castell of Glascow perteining to the bishop, and put certeine
gentlemen into it to k&eacute;epe it. Whereof the Frenchmen being aduertised, marched forward
to Glascow, to the number of fiue thousand men: the bishop of Glascow, the lords Sempill,
Seiton, Ros, and diuerse others with them, tooke the castell againe, and staieng one night
of the towne, returned on the next morrow to Kirkintulloch, and from thence to Lithquo
and Edenburgh.</p>
<p>After their returne from Glascow, a certeine number of Frenchmen went to Striueling,
and passing by the bridge ouer the water of Firth, came into Fife, in purpose to haue gone
vnto saint Andrews, and to haue fortified the towne. But they being in Kingcorne, there
assembled togither in Fife the earles of Arrane, and Rothes, the prior of saint Andrews, the
lord Ruthwen, the master of Lindsie, and diuerse other, hauing with them no great number: but yet they dailie skirmished with the Frenchmen, and would not suffer them to

of Southerland, who chanced to be with them at the pricking, was sore hurt and mained
in the arme with the dredge of a cal&eacute;euer shot.</p>
<p>As the Frenchmen were in their progresse, at the mouth of the water of Leuin in Fife,
<note place="marg">1560. <emph>Lesle.</emph></note>
there arriued in their sight a nauie of ships: which at the first kenning they tooke to be
French ships, but shortlie after perceiuing them to be the English nauie, they returned with
great diligence to Burnt Iland, where they passed the ferrie of Kingcorne in botes and craiers
<note place="marg">The towne Burnt Iland is fortified.</note>
to Leith, and instantlie began to fortifie that towne, casting great trenches about it, and
making great blockehouses for their defense, as preuenting such perils as otherwise might
haue befallen them, and vsing remedies in due time, by warlike policie of present deuise,
to prouide against afterclaps. The English ships came to the rode of Leith, where they

certeine barons of Merne, partlie for hatred to the catholike religion (as the Romish cleargie
tearmeth it) and partlie blinded with desire of preie (as in all assemblies of battell there
will be some) ouerthrew the monasterie of the Carmelite friers in Aberden. Who going
about also to haue spoiled the monasteries of the Trinitie, and of the friers Minors, were
hindered thereof by the lord Lesle, and the baron of Buchquhane, at the commandement
of the earle of Huntleie. Notwithstanding which, they could not be so sufficientlie repressed,
but that they went to old Aberden (for so they call that place in that towne, which is
beautified with the bishops palace, the canonrie, and the vniuersitie) and would haue assaulted the magnificent and statelie church thereof. But to k&eacute;epe them from the same, the

bishop, &amp; Iohn Lesle (the officiall of that place, the one by counsell, the other by preaching, and both by the aid of the earle of Huntleie) did their indeuor, at what time the Lesl&eacute;es put them besides their purpose.]</p>
<p>The qu&eacute;ene regent hearing of the arriuall of the English, sent vnto the viceadmerall of
that fl&eacute;et, named maister Winter, requiring to know of him, for what cause he was come
into those waters. This gentleman addressing himselfe to accomplish the commandement
imposed and laid vpon him, came face to face to the said viceadmerall, and with countenance, wherein appeared tokens of inward courage, put foorth his demand as he was inioined. The viceadmerall answered, that he had beene abroad on the seas seeking after
pirats, and in case anie of them came thither, he was arriued there in the Forth to wait on
them: where as the principall cause in d&eacute;ed was to impeach, that no Frenchman should
land there, in case anie came foorth of France, and also to k&eacute;epe them that laie in Inskith
from vittels, and that no Frenchman should passe by sea forth of Leith.</p>
<p>*Wherevpon the qu&eacute;ene regent did send Noualle the king of Frances orator in that

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
realme, to request the queene of England, that she would call hir ships home againe, and
that she would not send aiding souldiers to the lords of the religion (whome Lesleus neuer
tearmeth by anie other name than sectaries and sedirious persons) whereby the peace might
be broken with the French, and so occasion of warre giuen. Wherevnto hir maiestie answered (with no lesse care of hir kingdome than became the maiestie of so good a mother
to haue of hir children) that she had no such mind as to make warre. But bicause that
she certeinlie vnderstood, that great troops of Frenchmen did dailie land and increase in
Scotland, for what cause she knew not: she could doo no lesse than place souldiers in
diuerse forts and hauens, which might defend the English from the malice or hurt of such
strangers, if they should attempt anie thing. Neither would she suffer that hir people
should set foot in Scotland, vnlesse that they were prouoked therevnto by iniuries offered
them.]</p>
<p>About the same time, the qu&eacute;ene regent, hearing that the duke of Norffolke was come to

anie credit at all. Wherfore William Flower, then Chester herald, and now Norreie king

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"599"</fw>-->

of armes, was sent vnto the queene, who comming to Holie rood house n&eacute;ere to 
<note place="marg">An English herald sent to the qu&eacute;ene of Scots.</note>
Edenburgh, was receiued by sundrie heralds, &amp; so was had to one of their houses, and there
kept for that night. The next day after hee had dined, he was brought to the court, and
at his entering within the gates, there were a number of harquebussiers readie with their
p&eacute;eces that discharged and shot off the same.</p>
<p>At his comming to the presence of the qu&eacute;ene, he with dutifull obeisance deliuered his
letters, and after the same had b&eacute;ene read, he was demanded what credit he had to vtter.
Wherevpon he declared, that the duke of Norffolke, being the qu&eacute;enes maiesties lieutenant
in the north parts of England, maruelled greatlie that she would send an herald with letters,
and write therein how she had giuen credit to him; and yet when he was demanded to
vtter his credit, he should confesse that he had none. The qu&eacute;ene herewith called for the
herald, to vnderstand whether he had credit or not: who denied to haue anie at all. Wherwith the queene s&eacute;emed to be somwhat abashed, but neuerthelesse she brake foorth and
said, that she maruelled greatlie that the queene of England should send hir ships into hir
riuer, without giuing hir knowledge aforehand.</p>
<p>Chester answered thereto, that where it was certeinlie knowne, that the French king had
prepared to send a power of men of warre into Scotland, without aduertising hir thereof;
she could not but thinke that dealing verie strange, and therefore had in verie d&eacute;ed sent
certeine of hir ships, with vittels for prouision to be laid within hir townes and castels on the
frontiers. Which ships by tempest being dispersed, might happilie be driuen into the riuer
there, albeit he had not spoke with anie of them since there comming forth. But yet (as
he had heard by others) they had b&eacute;ene verie vncourteouslie vsed: for comming in after
that maner for succor, the canon had b&eacute;ene bent against them. Herewithall the count
Martigues standing by, began to speake verie stout words vnto Chester, alleging that where
<note place="marg">Martigues a forward capteine, but an vntrue prophet.</note>
it was perceiued well inough, that the queene of England ment to make war against his
maister the French king, he trusted she should gaine as little thereby, as his sister had
doone in breaking with hir father Henrie the late French king. Chester herevnto answered,
that he thought to haue found but one regent in Scotland, to whome he should need to
make answer: wherevpon Martigues was commanded to silence.</p>
<p>All this while the qu&eacute;ene had talked with Chester in the Scotish toong. And bicause he
did not so well vnderstand hir, he began to speake in the French language: whereat the
qu&eacute;ene s&eacute;emed greatlie to reioise, &amp; so began againe to discourse with him of hir griefs;
and he on the other part made hir answer as fell best to purpose. And at length, when
he was demanded what further credit he had; he declared, that where she had requested a
safe conduct for monsieur le Brosse to passe through England into France, if she would
s&eacute;e him safelie conueied to Berwike, he durst assure hir of a sufficient safe conduct for his
safe passage through the qu&eacute;ene his mistresse realme: but at length, there was another
gentleman commended to him, in lieu for la Brosse, that was his cousine. And now when
Chester shuld take his leaue, he declared that he had not beene courteouslie dealt with:
for since his comming thither, he could not be suffered to passe anie where abroad out of
his chamber, but at meale times. And therefore if anie of hir messengers should come into
the qu&eacute;ene his mistresse dominions, he would procure (if he might) that they should tast
of the like interteinment. But the queene seemed not to vnderstand that he had bin in
anie wise so hardlie dealt with, shewing that she&eacute;e was not well contented therewith; and
so Chester tooke his leaue, and returned backe into England, without anie reward for his
paines taken in that iournie, at the hands of the Scotish qu&eacute;ene: how so euer she liked of
his message.</p>
<p>In the meane time, there was an armie prepared in England, of seuen or eight thousand
<note place="marg"><date>1560.</date></note>

<note place="marg">An English armie.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 565.</note>
men, who were sent into Scotland; the lord Greie of England being appointed generall, who
came to the linkes, beside the towne of Leith, on saturday the sixt of Aprill. Before they
pitcht downe their field on the said linkes, monsieur Martigues, coronell of the French armie,
issued foorth of Leith with nine hundred harquebussiers of Frenchmen, to a little knoll

<!--<fw place="top-left">"600"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

called the Halke hill, where a sore, continuall, and hot skirmish was begun betwixt the 
<note place="marg">They were backed with 500 pikes which kept aloofe.</note>
Englishmen and Frenchmen, with hagbuts, cal&eacute;euers, and pistolets, which skirmish continued
fiue or six houres, in the which there were manie slaine on both parties, and diuerse hurt.
At length Martigues was forced with his companie to retire backe to the towne of Leith,
and the Englishmen pitched downe their campe, and planted their ordinance beside the
said hill.</p>
<p>The lord Greie being in Muskelburgh, sent to the qu&eacute;ene regent, that laie as then in
<note place="marg">The lord Greie sent vnto the qu&eacute;ene.</note>
the castell at Edenburgh, desiring an abstinence of warre for foure and twentie hours, that
in the meane time he might send some of his councell to declare to hir the cause of his comming with that armie, and to commune of such things as might stanch the shedding of bloud.
The queene granted herevnto, and sent an herald to Leith, to cause the said assurance to
be taken: but yer he came to the towne, the skirmish aforesaid was begun with forwardnesse
inough on both sides.</p>
<p>In this meane time, the lord Greie sent sir George Howard, and sir Iames Crofts to the
<note place="marg">Men are sent to speake with the queene mother.</note>
castell of Edenburgh, to speake with the qu&eacute;ene to that effect: who had long conference
with hir vpon the blockehouse at the vtter gate of the castell, during the time of the skirmish; where they declared, that the occasion of the comming of the armie, was for the cause
aboue mentioned, desiring the queene to procure the Frenchmen to depart the realme of
<note place="marg">The Frenchmen to depart the realme.</note>
Scotland: and they promised in that case to retume againe into their owne realme, and neither to disquiet Frenchmen nor Scots. Whervpon the qu&eacute;ene tooke time to be aduised till
the next day, that she might consult with the principall personages within the towne of
Leith, requiring that it might be lawfull for hir to send to them to that effect, which was
granted.</p>
<p>The next day she sent one Drummond a trumpetter, or herald (as saith Lesleus) with a
letter to monsieur de la Brosse, to the effect aforesaid, directing him to passe to the English campe, and to get a guide with him to go to the towne of Leith, as was agreed: and
there was one appointed to go with him. But immediatly after his departing from the
English campe, he was suddenlie called backe againe, and his letters taken from him,
was commanded to repaire to the castell of Edenburgh to the queene, and to declare to
<note place="marg">The English are desirous to reuenge the iniuries doone vnto them.</note>
hir that they would not haue anie talke, but would be reuenged on the Frenchmen, for
the slaughter of their men the night before. Thus the parl&eacute;e ceassing, the siege was inforced with right sharpe pursute, and strong defending on either part.</p>
<p>The Englishmen cast trenches vpon the southeast side of the towne, and raised a litle
mount which they called mount Pellam after the capteins name, and placed their ordinance
aloft thereon: but bicause it was so farre from the towne, they did not so much scath thereto
<note place="marg">A trench cast to little purpose.</note>
as they intended. The lord Greie, lieutenant of the English armie, lodged (during this siege)
within the towne of Lestalrike, in the deanes house, and the most part of their demilances
and other horssemen laie in the same towne. The footmen with their capteins lodged in hales,
tents and pauilions, vpon the south and southeast side of the towne of Leith, and diuerse Scotish lords incamped with them in the fields, as the earles of Argile, Arrane, Morton, and
Glencarne; the lords Boid, Ogiltree, the prior of saint Andrews, the maister of Maxwell,
and others. The duke of Chatelerault, and diuerse with him remained in Holie rood house:
and with the queene in the castell, the bishop of S. Andrews, the bishop of Dunkeld, the
earle Marshall, the lord Erskin capteine of the castell, maister Iames Macgill clearke of
the register, the prouost of Dunglas, called maister Abraham Chreichton, and diuerse others.</p>
<p>On Easter &eacute;euen, capteine Wood, and capteine Dethicke, seruing on the sea vnder maister Winter the English admerall there, were appointed by him to passe vp the riuer to
Blackenesse, who with their bands going aboord into a barke prepared for that purpose,
sailed forward: and on Easter day in the morning, presenting themselues before the castell,

it was y&eacute;elded to them by certeine Frenchmen that were within, and therevpon it was deliuered to the k&eacute;eping of Iames Hamilton, an ancient gentleman; and capteine Wood, being
set on shore, came to the campe before Leith by land. On blacke Monday, the Frenchmen,

<note place="marg">S&eacute;e more here of in England.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 10.</note>

<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene laboured for an agr&eacute;ement.</note>
in the English historie it further appeareth. During the siege thus afore Leith, the qu&eacute;ene
regent was sore vexed with sickenesse, but neuerthelesse, she continued to labor for agr&eacute;ement, not ceassing to send to the lords for to haue the matter taken vp. And for the better accomplishing of hir desire, she procured the earle of Huntleie to come foorth of the north,
who tooke vp his lodging in Edenburgh, and tooke great paines to treat betwixt the qu&eacute;ene
and lords for some agr&eacute;ement: but when he perceiued his trauell to be in vaine, h&eacute;e returned into the north againe, and left the siege lieng still as hee found it.</p>
<p>In this meane while, the Englishmen, lodging on the southside of the towne beside mount

Pellam, battered with their great artillerie at the parish church of Leith, and at saint Anthonies steeple, in which the Frenchmen had laid certeine p&eacute;eces of artillerie, and at length
beat it downe: but perceiuing they could not doo anie great hurt to the walles on that side,
they cast new trenches vpon the south and southwest side of the towne, and raised a mount
there, naming it mount Summerset, &amp; placed thereon certeine p&eacute;eces in batterie, and so beat
<note place="marg">Mount Summerset.</note>
the wals, that a great part thereof was ouerthrowne, and a breach made. Wherevpon the
Englishmen &amp; Scots on a morning came with their ladders, and presenting themselues to
the assault, found the breach nothing reasonable; so that although they egerlie preased forward to enter the towne, yet they were fiercelie beaten backe with great slaughter and

bloudshed on both parts, but namelie of the assailants.</p>
<p>The Englishmen, perceiuing that they were too rash in assaulting the towne, being not assaultable, deuised other shifts to obteine their purpose, raising an other mount of earth on the
<note place="marg">Mount Falcon.</note>
west side of the water of Leith, and named it mount Falcon. Aloft on this mount, when it
was brought vp vnto a great heigth, they planted their great artillerie, which continuallie
beat into the towne, sore annoieng them within, but speciallie beating the houses and places
by the shore side, so that none might go vp nor downe the towne on that part, without danger to be slaine with shot from that mount. The Frenchmen, during the time of the siege,
manie times issued foorth towards the sands, and sometimes towards the trenches, so that sundrie sore skirmishes chanced betwixt the Englishmen and them, with the slaughter of diuerse,
both of the one part and the other. Amongest other of them within, there were slaine
two Scotish men of name, to wit, capteine Kenedie, and yoong Henrie Drummond: and of
them without, there was slaine a Scotish gentleman, called the lard of Cleisch.</p>
<p>The English armie was throughlie furnished with vittels foorth of all parts of the realme,
and that vpon reasonable prices: but the French within the towne could get none, more
<note place="marg">The towne of Leith vnprouided of vittele.</note>
than they had prouided before the comming of the English armie, which when it began to
faile them, they were constreined to eat their owne horsses, whose flesh seemed to them in
that necessitie more delicious, than before that time anie maner of venison. Those within Inskeith also were in great necessitie of vittels: but yet neither they within the one
place, nor they within the other, would render their strength, looking still for aid foorth
of France. * Whilest these things were doone in Scotland, the French king, to shew how

he fauoured the pope, and how farre he maligned the reformed lords of Scotland, sent his
ambassadors Iohn Babone a Burdseie knight, and that eloquent man Anthonie Muret of
France to pope Pius the fourth of that name, to y&eacute;eld all the dominions of France &amp; Scotland at the popes commandement.</p>
<p>In the meane time, the qu&eacute;ene regent, perceiuing hir sicknesse so to increase, that she

looked for present death, sent for the duke of Chatelerault, and all the lords of Scotland
that were in the towne of Edenburgh, and in the campe: who came vnto hir altogither into
the castell of Edenburgh, where she made vnto them a graue and pithie exhortation, persuading them "to vnitie and concord with their ancient friends of France; and now more
stedfast to them than at anie time before, by reason of the mariage of the qu&eacute;ene their good
souereigne, with the king of France. And h&eacute;erewith she brake out into certeine woords,
to dissuade them from the amitie contracted with the Englishmen, declaring that the Englishmen aided them not for anie other respect, than for their owne turae and commoditie.

Moreouer, for hir owne part she said, that she fauoured the weale of the realme of Scotland, as much as France; considering she had the honor to be queene and regent thereof,
and hir daughter heritable qu&eacute;ene of the same.</p>
<p>"Furthermore she said, that if she had attempted anie thing that s&eacute;emed or app&eacute;ered to
the noble men contrarie therevnto; the same came to passe rather for lacke of wisedome
and iudgement, than for want of anie good will: and if it pleased God to prolong hir
daies, she would be glad to amend that had beene doone amisse: and if he called hir to
his mercie, she praied them most hartilie to acknowledge their dutie vnto the queene their
souereigne, and to mainteine their ancient amitie with the king and realme of France, &amp; to
make some good accord with the French that were within the towne of Leith, who would
gladlie accept the same, to the end that as well they as the Englishmen should depart this
realme. For she feared greatlie (as she said) least if the Frenchmen departed, the 
<note place="marg">A mistrustfull mind.</note>
Englishmen would still remaine, and subdue the land to their obedience: and therefore she besought
all good Scotishmen to haue respect to the libertie and weale of their countrie."</p>
<p>After she had talked thus a good while with manie teares, she desired the lords to forgiue hir in anie thing wherein she had offended anie of them, during the time of hir being
in Scotland, which they gladlie s&eacute;emed to doo: and on the other part, she forgaue them
with all hir hart (as it app&eacute;ered) all offenses which they had committed against hir: and
thus diuerse of them w&eacute;eping, she tooke euerie of them by the hand, and so they taking
leaue of hir, departed, and returned into Edenburgh, and to their campe. Whilest the siege
thus laie before the towne of Leith, diuerse great troubles rose in sundrie parts of the realme,

Gordon, then postulat of Gallowaie, maister Iohn Lesle officiall of Aberden, and William

Bothwell, and Sarlalouse, then capteine of the souldiers, and gouernor of the castell of

<p>At the same time, one maister Donald Frasher, archdeacon of Rosse, tooke the bishops

Foulis, and the shiriffe Tramercie, who assembled about the same, and besieged the 
<note place="marg">The castell is besieged.</note>
castell, where great force was vsed, both by them without to win it, and of them within to defend it. The bishop being then resident in Cromercie castell, hearing that the house wold
not be gotten without great slaughter, thought it against his conscience, his profit, and
honor, to win it in that manner: and therefore sending for maister Iohn Lesle, officiall of
Aberden, and maister Alexander Dunbar, subchantor of Murreie, by their labour and diligent treating in the matter, the bishop by reasonable appointment recouered his castell of

<p>The French king, vnderstanding in what distresse his men remained that were besieged
within Leith, and perceiuing himselfe not able to send an armie to succour them within the
time that their necessitie required, thought good to trie if the matter might be taken vp: and

the qu&eacute;ene, and not vnto the subiects of Scotland: for it was not m&eacute;et that the king should

good experience of the nature and inclination of the nobilitie and people of Scotland.</p>
<p>During the time that she was regent, she kept good iustice, and was well obeied in all

deuise new alterations of lawes, impositions, taxations, and such things as were not in vse

<p>In the winter, the lords of the councell gaue faculties of benefices to diuerse of their

naturall countrie, and were skilfull of the affaires of Scotland, did allege that those seditions
were rather occasioned by the default of the kings &amp; gouernors, than of the subiects;
whilst they striued to reduce that kingdome (which from the beginning had alwaies b&eacute;ene
free) to infinit bondage, and to the fr&eacute;e power of the lawes: which that nation (being more
warlike than welthie) could not indure. When contrarilie, they did not onelie defend all
their gouernors (which did not attempt the ouerthrow of their liberties) from the outward
enimie, and from the inward tumults of the people: but they also made them (through loue
and dutie towards their kings) inuincible ouer their enimies, and famous amongest strange
nations.</p>
<p>"And that the chiefest meane at this time to pacifie all those troubles in Scotland, was
not to make alteration of anie thing in Scotland, from the state wherein euen now it standeth. Wherevpon she resolued to come sp&eacute;edilie into Scotland, whereof more shall be said
hereafter; vntill which, we will intreat of other matters doone in Scotland. The qu&eacute;ene of
Scots hauing hir mind still setled vpon hir returne into Scotland; Noalius a senator of Burdeaux landed before this in Scotland (whither he was sent) a little after the end of the publike parlement, for which cause he was staied and turned ouer to the next assemblie of parlement, which was appointed the twelfe kalends of Iune.</p>
<p>"But when at that time also the nobilitie assembled did not sit in councell, because they
were yet vncerteine of the qu&eacute;enes mind; in the meane time Iames Steward returned out of
France, and brought with him a commission, which gaue them authoritie to hold a parlement, therein to treat and conclude of matters touching the common-wealth. Wherevpon
in the end there was audience giuen to the ambassador, the effect of whose legacie was, to
renew the old league with France, to vndoo the league with England, and that priests should
be restored to their liuings, out of which they had beene thrust by violence.</p>
<p>"To these things it was answered, that concerning the league of France, they were not
anie waie guiltie of the breach thereof; and contrarilie that the French had manifoldlie neglected the same; but speciallie of late, in seeking the authoritie of their publike libertie,
in that they would haue brought the people (their frends and giltles of anie euill) vnto mi
serable aeruitude. For the league with England, they could not by anie meanes dissolue
that, except they should be counted most vnthankefull, recompense so great a benefit with
great wickednes, &amp; conspire against the defendors of their liberties. And as touching restitution for such as they called priests, they did acknowlege that they had not anie office,
vse, or authoritie in the church."</p>
<p>In this councell also it was decr&eacute;ed, to ouerthrow all the monasteries of moonks, for which
cause diuerse were sent out into all places of the realme to execute the same. By occasion whereof, the qu&eacute;ene being in France, and desirous to haue peacefull landing in Scotland; would not for this present meddle with religion, but dissembled the same: although
Dureus abbat of Ferline, and Iohn Sinclere latelie appointed bishop of Brechine, did vehementlie persuade and labor hir to the contrarie.</p>
<p>In this yeare also on the ninth of March, was the election of superintendents at

<note place="marg">Abbridged out of the printed booke thereof.</note>
Edenburgh, which was published to serue for the election of all other ministers in this forme following (Iohn Knox being the minister thereof.) First was made a sermon, in which these
parts were intreated; principallie the necessitie of ministers and superintendents. Secondlie
the crimes &amp; vices that might vnable them of the ministerie. Thirdlie the vertues required
in them. Fourthlie &amp; lastlie, whether such as by publike consent of the church were called
to such office, might refuse the same.</p>
<p>The sermon finished, it was declared by the same minister Iohn Knox (the maker of that
speech or sermon) that the lords of the secret councell had giuen charge and power to the
churches of Louthian, to choose maister Iohn Spotswood superintendent, &amp; that sufficient warning was made by publike edict to the churches of Edenburgh, Luithithgue,
Sriueling, Treuent*, Hadington, &amp; Dunbar, as also to earles, lords, barons, gentlemen and

others, which haue or might claime to haue voice in the election to be present that daie at the
same houre. And therefore inquisition was made, who were present, and who were absent.</p>
<p>After this was called the said maister Iohn Spotswood, who answering to his name, the
<note place="marg">Euerie nation is to haue his peculiar gouernement in religion, as is best liking to the godlie disposers of the religion of that countrie, sith "<emph>vulgus monstr&umacr; multorum capitum.</emph>"</note>
minister Knox demanded, if anie man knew anie crimes or offenses of the said Spotswood,
that might disable him to be called to that office. Which thing thrise demanded, there
was after question mooued to the whole multitude; if there were anie other whome they
would put in election with the said Spotswood. Then the people were asked whether (if
they admitted the said Spotswood for their superintendent) they would honor and obeie him
as Christes minister in euerie thing perteining to his charge.</p>
<p>Wherevnto the people answered that they would, which thus granted, there were further
questions and matters touching the articles of the apostles creed, and concerning the state of
religion propounded to the superintendent, intended to be created. Wherevnto, when he
had answered affirmatiuelie, the people were againe demanded for his allowance; which they
easilie granted with the consent of the nobilitie. These things thus performed, and a certeine praier (to obteine the spirit of God to be powred into this new elect vessell) finished,
the rest of the ministers (if there be anie) and elders of the church present, in signe of their
full consent, shall take the elected by the hand.</p>
<p>And so the chiefe minister giuing an especiall benediction (the forme whereof is there
set downe, with the exhortation which they must also vse to the elected) this election is
wholie finished (without anie imposition of hands on his head) and he sufficientlie created a
superintendent minister; of whose election of elders, deacons, excommunications, and other
ecclesiasticall regiment, I meane not to speake anie more (as matter impertinent to my discourse, though not to the nature of an ecclesiasticall historie) sith I haue onelie here in hand
the politicall and temporall gouernement, and not the discourse of religion and essentiall
forme thereof.]</p>
<p>Before this, in the beginning of the winter this yeare, the lords sent the earle of Morton

and Glencarne, and the yoong lard of Ledington secretarie, ambassadors into England; to
giue thanks to the queens maiestie of England, for the aid which they had receiued of hir,
to expell the Frenchmen. The earle of Murreie passed through England into France. He
<note place="marg"><date>1561.</date></note>
departed from Edenburgh the eighteenth of March, and in Aprill came to Vitrie, as hereafter shall appeare; where he found the qu&eacute;ene, meaning to submit himselfe. But the
day before he came, maister Iohn Lesle officiall of Aberden was come thither, who was sent
from the earle of Huntleie, and other the lords spirituall and temporall of the north parts; he
tooke ship in the rode of Aberden, and landing at Brule in Holand, passed through the lowe
countries in post till he came to Paris, and from thence vnto Vitrie aforesaid [the eight&eacute;enth

kalends of March] where he found the qu&eacute;ene, whom he most dutifullie saluted.</p>
<p>"* After which (being most courteouslie receiued of hir) he opened vnto hir the effect of
his ambassage, which consisted speciallie vpon these parts; to admonish the queene that she

prior of saint Andrews (hir bastard brother) for his onelie drift was, that he (hauing no

the kingdome, vnder the colour whereof he might more easilie teare &amp; cleane ouerthrow the
catholike religion; which he did assault by all meanes possible.</p>
<p>"Wherefore Lesle did with all the firmest aduise and counsell which he might, vrge the
queene not to y&eacute;eld to his cloked words. For the obteining of which demand from the qu&eacute;ene,
he did fitlie ad to his persuasions, that Iames did rather aspire to the kingdome, than that
he fixed his mind and eie vpon the ouerthrow of religion. Wherefore, if she had anie care

which were yet wauering, might more fr&eacute;elie and willinglie be brought againe to the catholike religion. For there was an other order to be vsed in Scotland, than that which the
French obserued, whilest they gouerned there; at which time vndoubtedlie the Scots were
hopelesse euer to haue inioied the presence of the queene.</p>
<p>"But now, sith that the Scots doo vnderstand, that their qu&eacute;ene (contrarie to their hope)
will returne vnto them, hir presence will (like the rising sun) so cause the clouds of all
tumults to vanish out of the minds of all hir subiects, that they will easilie incline to the
mind of the qu&eacute;ene, whatsoeuer she shall thinke, attempt, set downe, or decree, in restoring
of religion. For the Scots are of that mind towards their princes, as they will in all things
obeie their vpright gouernors; and are accustomed with no lesse mind to resist tyrants, if
they vsurpe vpon them in exaction of authoritie.</p>
<p>"Wherefore Lesleus did earnestlie persuade the queene in the name of the earle of Huntleie,
and the other nobilitie, that she should not giue hir selfe (as vanquished) into the hands of
the enimies, and especiallie of Iames Steward hir brother, from whome (as from a founteine)
all their seditions haue had beginning. For Iames Cullen (kinsman to the erle of Huntleie,
an expert seruitor in the warres by sea and land) was sent foorth with Lesle (as capteine
of that iournie) to bring hir safe to Aberden. For all the nobles of the north prouinces
will soone be readie with twentie thousand men to gard hir to Edenburgh, and to defend
hir against all the counsels, deceipts, and forces of all men."</p>
<p>Which message being thus ended from the mouth of Lesle, the queene commanded
him not to depart from hir, vntill she returned into Scotland; and further gaue in charge,
that letters should be written to the p&eacute;eres and nobilitie of Scotland, to let them vnderstand
of hir comming into Scotland, &amp; to be a witnesse of hir good will vnto them. The next
day after came to the qu&eacute;ene at Vitrie, in Champaigne, Iames Steward (which is touched a
little before) the prior of S. Andrews. Who after he had in reuerence doone his dutie,
bound himselfe with all fidelitie, trauell, and diligence, most religiouslie vnto hir; faithfullie
further promising, that he would prouide that the Scots should willinglie obeie hir, without
anie forren powers to be brought by hir into Scotland.</p>
<p>For it was thought that he went into France for that purpose, to dissuade the qu&eacute;ene that
she should not bring any power of the French with hir. But in the end, vttering his mind
more fullie, and putting awaie all suspicion of deceit, he did with more familiaritie request
the qu&eacute;ene to honor him with the erldome of Murreie. Wherevnto the queene did courteouslie answer, that she would satisfie his request when she came into Scotland. Wherefore, when this Iames perceiued that the queene was somewhat well bent towards him,
and that she credited his words, he attended on hir vnto laneuille, and there remaining
with hir a certeine space, did after go into Scotland (as is before said) to prepare the minds
of the people, that they might receiue the qu&eacute;ene comming into the realme, with good consent and dutifull honor; who passing through England, came into Scotland in the kalends
of Maie.]</p>

noble men of the realme, aduertised of the qu&eacute;ens comming, assembled at Edenburgh with
all possible diligence. In the meane time, whilst the qu&eacute;ene was preparing to take hir
<note place="marg">Ships wait in the narrow seas.</note>
iournie, and to come into Scotland, the queene of England set foorth some of hir great
ships to the seas, to watch &amp; gard the coasts of hir realme. Whereof they being aduertised
in France, sent the abbat of saint Colmes Inch to the qu&eacute;ene of England, to desire of hir
a safe conduct, in case by wind or tempest she chanced to land in England. But before he
<note place="marg">A safe conduct required.</note>
was returned to Calis therewith, as he was appointed; the qu&eacute;ene and hir retinue were

to passe through the same into Scotland before hir c&omacr;ming, there to haue receiued the forts
of Dunbar and Inskeith, of monsieur Charlebois, and to haue kept the same till hir comming. But he was staied, and passed no further than to London: for it was thought that
his going into Scotland would turne to no great benefit of that realme: because that he &amp;
monsieur Rubeie were the principall authors of all the troubles in Scotland, betwixt the
queene regent, and the nobilitie there. She was attended on from Paris vnto Calis with
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene was conueied into Calis.</note>
manie noble men; namelie hir six vncles, the dukes of Guise, and Daumall, the cardinall
of Lorraine and Guise, the grand prior, and the marquesse Dalbeuf, also the duke de Nemeurs, and other of hir friends and kinsmen.</p>
<p>There were two gallies prepared, and certeine other ships to go with hir into Scotland,
<note place="marg">She taketh hir iournie into Scotland.</note>
and there went with hir three of hir said vncles, the duke Daumall, the grand prior,
and the marquesse Dalbeuf: also monsieur Danuille the constables sonne, and diuerse other.
She arriued at Leith the twentith day of August, in the yeare of our Lord 1561, where she
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene arriued at Leith.</note>
was honorablie receiued by the earle of Argile, the lord Erskin, the prior of saint Andrews,
and of the burgesses of Edenburgh, and conueied to the abbeie of Holie rood house. For
(as saith Buchanan) when some had spread abroad hir landing in Scotland, the nobilitie
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 17.</note>
and others assembled out of all parts of the realme, as it were to a common spectacle.</p>
<p>This did they, partlie to congratulat hir returne, &amp; partlie to shew the dutie which they
alwaies bare vnto hir (when she was absent) either to haue thanks therefore, or to preuent
the slanders of their enimies; whereof not a few by these beginnings of hir reigne did
gesse what would follow; although in those so variable motions of the minds of the people,
euerie one was verie desirous to s&eacute;e their queene offred vnto them (vnlooked for) after so
manie haps of both fortunes as had fallen vnto hir. For when she was but six daies old,
she lost hir father among the cruell tempests of battell, and was by great diligence brought
vp by hir mother (being a chosen and woorthie person) but yet left as a preie to others,
by reason of ciuill seditions in Scotland, and of outward warres with other nations, being
further laid abroad to all the dangers of frowning fortune, before she could know what euill
did meane.</p>
<p>For leauing hir owne countrie, she was nourished as a banished person, and hardlie preserued in life from the weapons of hir enimies, &amp; violence of the seas. After which, fortune began to flatter hir, in that she honored hir with a woorthie mariage, which in truth
was to this qu&eacute;ene rather a shadow of ioie, than anie comfort at all. For shortlie after the
same, all things were turned to sorrow, by the death of hir new yoong husband, and of
hir old and gr&eacute;eued mother; by losse of hir new kingdome, and by the doubtfull possession
of hir old inheritable realme. But as for these things she was both pitied and praised; so
was she also for gifts of nature as much loued and fauored; in that, beneficiall nature (or
rather good God) had indued hir with a beautifull face, a well composed bodie, an excellent
wit, a mild nature, and good behauior; which she had artificiallie furthered by courtlie
education and affable demeanor. Whereby at the first sight, she wan vnto hir the hearts
of most people, and confirmed the loue of hir faithfull subiects.]</p>
<p>Being thus come out of France, she brought into Scotland manie rich and eostlie iewels
<note place="marg">Costlie iewels.</note>
of gold worke, pretious stones, orient pearls, &amp; such like, as excellent and faire as were to
be found within Europe, with rich furniture of houshold, as hangings, carpets, counterpoints, and all other necessaries for the furnishing of hir princelie houses. The chiefest
part of the hangings and other furniture of household, was shipped at Rone, and arriued
<note place="marg">Hir houshold sluffe.</note>
at Leith in the moneth of October next following. After the qu&eacute;ene of Scots had remained
the space of foure or fiue daies at Holie rood house, the duke of Chatelerault, the earle of
Argile, and diuerse other of the nobilitie being present, there was an act made by the lords

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

present] with consent of the queene, that to remooue all causes of trouble in time to come
for the matter of religion, it was ordeined, that no alteration of the estate of religion publikelie standing within the realme, at hir arriuall in the same, should be made; &amp; that

nothing should be attempted, either publikelie or priuatlie to the contrarie, vpon great paine,
which was put foorth and published through all parts of the realme with great diligence.</p>
<p>After this, there were eleuen temporall lords, and one bishop chosen to be of the queenes
<note place="marg">Some appointed to be of the qu&eacute;enes councell.</note>

<note place="marg">Secretarie.</note>

<note place="marg">Comptroller.</note>

<note place="marg">Lords of the priuie councel.</note>
secret councell, by whose aduise she should rule and gouerne things, six of them to remaine
continuallie with hir in roome of officers, as the secretarie, comptroller, and others. The
lords of the priuie councell were these, the duke of Chatelerault, the earle of Huntleie
chancellor, the earle of Argile, the earle of Atholl, the earle Marshall, the earle of Glencarne, the earle of Morton, the earle of Montrosse, the earle of Erroll, maister Henrie Sinclar bishop of Rosse, and the lord Erskin, with the prior of S. Andrew. * But among
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 16.</note>
these reioisings of the queenes interteinment into hir kingdome, there happened a light fault,
but such as did deepelie enter into the minds of both the factions, of the catholikes (forsooth)
and of the reformed religion.</p>
<p>For where it was agr&eacute;ed by the qu&eacute;ene and the nobilitie, that no alteration should be had
of religion in the publike state, yet was masse permitted to hir and to hir familie priuilie to
be vsed. For the preparation wherof whilest the vestments and other things were caried
through the hall into the chappell, one of the companie snatched awaie the wax candels and
brake them: by occasion whereof (if some of the houshold had not come betw&eacute;ene to
helpe in that action, and ended the same) all the other furniture had b&eacute;ene throwne downe.
Which matter was taken of people diuerslie, some blaming it as a most sawcie part; others
interpreting it, that it was onelie doone to trie the patience of the priest; and some iudged
and said that the priest was woorthie to be punished with that paine which the scripture
appointeth to idolaters.</p>
<p>Which matter in the verie beginning was appeased by Iames the qu&eacute;enes bastard brother,
not yet created, but in expectation earle of Murreie. For which cause he would not offend
the qu&eacute;ene, as I suppose, though afterward he not onelie offended hir, but deposed hir, and
set vp hir sonne; as more plainlie shall hereafter appeare. At the quieting of this matter
(saith Buchanan) George Gordon was greatlie grieued, being a man bent to all occasions
of troubles, who thinking now to win fauor to him thereby, did say to the qu&eacute;enes vncies
that were present, that he would reduce the countrie beyond Calidon vnto the old religion.
The which being ind&eacute;ed suspected of manie, and feared by such as had heard manie other
things of his wit; they caried the same to the qu&eacute;enes brother, by meanes whereof this
little sparke in the beginning was the occasion of all the long ciuill dissention in Scotland,
as I am led to iudge by manie reasons.</p>
<p>But now although the gouernment (as before is touched) was appointed to twelue 
<note place="marg"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 10. <emph>pag.</emph> 587.</note>
bebefore named, or at lest to six, which by turnes should be assistant to the qu&eacute;ene: yet the
whole d&eacute;ed of ruling did in effect depend vpon hir bastard brother Iames, by reason of
the fauor that the queene especiallie did beare vnto him. Wherefore this Iames, vsing the
queenes authoritie at his pleasure, did bestow manie liberall gifts vpon his fellowes. Which
the nobles so much misliked, that in the end manie of them began egerlie to beare his
authoritie, as hereafter shall be more touched.]</p>

Danuille taried somewhat longer, and passed through England into France. The marquesse
Daulbeuf taried in Scotland all the next winter, till the spring of the y&eacute;ere, and then returned into France through England. The towne of Edenburgh prepared great and costlie
triumphs for the qu&eacute;enes entering, which sh&eacute;e made into that towne in the moneth of
September. After this, she passed vnto Striueling, and from thence to Perth, and then
to Dundee, and also to saint Andrews, into which townes she was receiued with great honor
and triumph. From saint Andrews she returned vnto Edenburgh, where she remained all
the next winter. In December there was a great assemblie of all the principall lords,

for the maintenance of hir traine, and to susteine the ministers, till some order were taken
to mainteine hir houshold, and a gard to tend on hir, by the aduise of the estates.</p>
<p>The prelats agr&eacute;ed for the qu&eacute;enes pleasure to support hir with the fourth part of the
fruits of their benefices, for one y&eacute;eres space onelie, to helpe to beare hir charges, and to
susteine hir gard; and in the meane time order might be taken by the aduise of the whole
estates for the same. But notwithstanding the refusall of the prelates to paie the third part,
the lords of the priuie councell made an act, and set foorth letters, that all the prelats and
<note place="marg">An act for the cleargie.</note>
beneficed men should be charged to paie y&eacute;erelie to the qu&eacute;enes comptroller and his collector, the whole thirds of all fruits of their benefices: and that it should be lawfull to the
comptroller and his deputies, to take the third of what part of euerie benefice where he best
pleased, and to deale therewith at his pleasure: also to haue to doo with the rents of
brotherhoods of common churches, and such like. This order hath b&eacute;ene obserued euer
since, not without great grudge of the prelats, and other beneficed men of the realme, and
their friends, as well those that professed the reformed religion, as others.</p>
<p>* Whilest these things were in dooing, William Mettellan the yoonger was sent 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 17.</note>
ambassador into England, to salute the queene of that realme (as the maner is) &amp; to declare the
good mind that the qu&eacute;ene of Scots bare vnto hir, &amp; the desire that his mistresse had to
haue peace and vnitie preserued betw&eacute;ene them. Besides all which, and manie other demands touching Scotland (which I suppresse for manie reasons, bicause (as Salomon saith)
<emph>Car regis inscrutabile,</emph> &amp; the mysteries of princes gouernment are not to be laid open to
common eies and eares) this ambassador deliuered letters to the queene of England from
the nobilitie of Scotland. In which there was a courteous remembrance of hir former fauor
and of their good will. Requesting further that the qu&eacute;ene of England would shew a
publike and priuat liking and friendship to their qu&eacute;ene, to the end that the qu&eacute;ene of Scots
prouoked by hir benefits, might not onelie remaine stedfast in the amitie alreadie begun:
but might also (if it were possible) be dailie more and more fast bound vnto hir: and they
for their parts would not omit anie occasion with all good will and diligence to continue this
amitie.</p>
<p>To which ambassador the qu&eacute;ene of England made no lesse honorable than wise answer:
the effect whereof, because it concerneth matter of great importance, &amp; is long and largelie
alreadie set downe by Buchanan, in hir maiesties singular commendation to the whole world
in the Latine toong, I thinke it not necessarie h&eacute;ere to repeat: and therefore I doo purposelie omit the same, least I might seeme by flatterie to intrude my pen into the eloquent
sp&eacute;ech of hir maiestie: and not being able to deliuer it with such grace as both she spake
it, and Buchanan penneth it, I might dishonor hir, &amp; ouerthrow my selfe, like vnto Phaeton. For as he, taking vpon him to rule the chariot of the sunne, was by his insufficiencie
therefore consumed with the heat and glorie therof; so should I in presuming with vnskill
to pen the tale of such a woorthie prince, consume my credit, in misordering or defacing
the maiestie, grauitie, wisedome, and life of hir singular wit and eloquence. For which
cause, leauing the same, we doo in this sort bring backe our pen to the continuance of the
historie of Scotland.</p>
<p>The qu&eacute;ene of Scots had a brother called Iohn, a man desirous of authoritie, but yet not
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 17.</note>
so seuere in mind as was Iames the other brother. This Iohn easilie persuading himselfe
to obeie the qu&eacute;ene in all things, was the more d&eacute;ere vnto hir, and most fit for hir, desirous
(as saith Buchanan, but how trulie I know not) to confound all things. With this Iohn
(in absence of the other brother Iames) she did consult to hier a companie of souldiers to
be about hir, the cause whereof was this. In the night there was a tumult or stur, as though
the earle of Arran would, in the absence of the nobilitie, secretlie set vpon the queene, and
by strength haue labored to carie hir to his castell, which was fouret&eacute;ene miles from thence.
All which s&eacute;emeth likely to be but a tale, either for the queenes mind that was estranged
from him, or for the immoderat loue which he bare vnto hir: both which were sufficientlie
knowen to the common people. Which tumult being spred abroad, these souldiers after

belonged to Iohn Areskin] by the qu&eacute;ens speciall gift, and was maried the same day
vnto Agnis Keith, daughter to the erle Marshall, with great feasts and triumphs, lasting
thr&eacute;e daies. * In which mariage he did so much exceed, that he greatlie offended the

the more vehementlie, because he had before time in all his life behaued himselfe far more
temperatlie than he did at this time.]</p>

<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene of England desirous to speake with the qu&eacute;ene of Scotland.</note>

Yorke, where she would m&eacute;et hir, to talke with hir of diuerse matters, that might make
to the confirmation of the amitie and friendship which nature had knit betw&eacute;ene them, by
coniunction and affinitie of bloud. And after consultation had with hir councell, the qu&eacute;ene
of Scots agr&eacute;ed thereto: and so they were appointed to m&eacute;et at Yorke in the moneth of
Iulie next following. But when things were prepared and put in a readinesse for the iournie,
the qu&eacute;ene of England sent woord to the qu&eacute;ene of Scots, that she could not keepe the

message was accepted, and so the iournie staied.</p>

Hamilton being duke of Chatelerault, and father to the earle of Arran, first wrote to the
qu&eacute;ene, then after went he vnto hir to saint Andrewes, and with manie praiers requested
hir that she would vpon sufficient pledges deliuer to him the earle Bothwell, and Gawen
Hamilton, but he could not obteine anie thing therein at hir hands. At what time also the
qu&eacute;ene went to Dunbreton (which Hamilton held since the time that he was gouernor) to
demand the deliuerie of the same into hir hands, which was accordinglie deliuered vnto hir.]
Shortlie after, the qu&eacute;ene of Scots tooke hir iournie towards the north parts of Scotland,

and stripes giuen and taken) the lord Ogiluie and his companie were hurt. Wherefore Iohn
Gordon was taken, &amp; put in ward at the tolbuith of Edenburgh, out of which he escaped,
after he had remained prisoner therein about twentie daies, and tooke his waie northward:
wherevpon followed great trouble shortlie after to the house of Huntleie. The qu&eacute;ene accompanied with the earles of Argile, Murreie, and Morton, the lord Erskin, and others,
passed forwards in hir iournie towards the north part, and caused Iohn Gordon of Finnater

to be summoned to app&eacute;ere and answer the law at Aberden, for breaking prison, and hurting
the lord Ogiluie. The qu&eacute;ene comming to the towne of Aberden, was honorablie receiued
with diuerse orations, and Latine enterludes, before the grammar schoole and college.</p>

intreated by Iohn Lesle a noble man, and follower of the Gordons, to vouchsafe his house

This place, because it was no common place of resort, was thought verie conuenient for
the execution of the earle of Murreie, whose death was conspired (as after shall appeere.)
Wherevpon Lesle, who was not ignorant of this secret counsell, besought the queene that
she would not laie such a note of infamie vpon him and his familie, that he should seeme
to haue betraied the chiefest brother of the qu&eacute;ene, no euill man, and one that was not his
enimie, whereby he might come vnto his death at his house. Wherevpon it then ceassed,

and the next night was also quietlie passed ouer at Rothimie, a towne of the Abernethians,
because the next day the qu&eacute;ene was determined to go to Strabogie.]</p>
<p>Wherevpon the earle of Huntleie, hauing before heard that his sonne was thus summoned, assembled the principall earles, lords, barons, and gentlemen of the north, who
came with him to Aberden, to helpe his son at the law day appointed for his app&eacute;erance,
which was in September. The earle came vnto the qu&eacute;ene himselfe, and at length it was
agreed, that his sonne the said Iohn Gordon should returne to prison againe in Striueling
<note place="marg">Gordon is commanded to Striueling castell.</note>

<note place="marg">He disobeied.</note>
castell, there to remaine during the qu&eacute;enes pleasure. But he following the euill counsell
of some yoong heads that were with him, neither fulfilled the qu&eacute;enes pleasure, nor his
fathers appointment, but attempted to reuenge his extreme handling (as he tooke it) vpon
the earle of Murreie, whome he put most in blame for the rigor shewed against him, but
his enterprise tooke not effect. Now the qu&eacute;ene aduertised of his disobedience, went not
to Strabogie, notwithstanding there was great preparation made for hir in that place, for the
receiuing of hir and hir traine: but she went vnto Balwanie, the earle of Athols place, and
from thence to Kinlos, to Tarnewaie, and so came to Inuernesse, and there lodged.</p>
<p>In this meane while, the earle of Huntleie, purposing to attend on the queene at Inuernesse, caused prouision to be made in the castell for his lodging. The qu&eacute;ene suspecting
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene suspected the earle of Huntleie.</note>
his dealing, least this should be doone vpon some policie, commanded the k&eacute;epers of the

and therefore the capteine of that castell called Alexander Gordon, for refusing to deliuer it,

was hanged vpon the towne bridge. The lord Gordon &amp; his brother Iohn Gordon of Finnater came that night within a little space distant from the towne of Inuernesse, which caused
great feare in the towne, so that there was a diligent watch all that night. The earle of
Huntleie being come to Kinlosse, and hearing that the castell of Inuernesse was commanded
to be giuen vp into the hands of an herald, sent with all diligence to the k&eacute;epers, that they
should deliuer it, &amp; returned himselfe to Strabogie.</p>
<p>The qu&eacute;ene remained in Inuernesse the space of foure or fiue daies, where the principall
capteine of the clanes of the countrie came to hir, and with a great companie [of the 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
ancient Scots (as hath Buchanan) whereof the chiefe were the Fraisers and Murreies, valiant
families in those parts] conueied hir to Spine, where she was informed that the earle of
Huntleie had gathered an armie to come against hir, and made their assemble at Spaie.
H&eacute;erevpon, they tooke with them all the artillerie ouer Spine, and caried the same in carts,
and all other kind of munition, and passed forward to Bamf that night. The earle of
Huntleie all this while came not foorth of Strabogie. The qu&eacute;ene as she passed forward,
rode to the place of Finnater, and there in hir owne presence, caused the k&eacute;epers thereof
to be charged to deliuer it, which they refused to doo. From Bamf the qu&eacute;ene rode to
the lard of Geichtis place, called Geicht, and the next day there was great preparation for
hir entrie into the new towne of Aberden. She lodged one night in the bishops palace,
<note place="marg">She came to Aberden.</note>
and the next day she was honorablie receiued, and lodged in the prouosts house of the
towne, where she remained all the time of hir abode in Aberden.</p>
<p>After this, the lord Iohn prior of Coldingham, with diuerse gentlemen, was sent against

the earle of Huntleie to Strabogie, but he was escaped before they approched. The ladie
Huntleie receiued them verie courteouslie, and gaue them good interteinement, and so they
returned. There was charge giuen to Louthian, Fife, Angus, Stratherne, the Merns, and
to the shire of Aberden, to come to Aberden quarterlie, euerie countrie to remaine there
fift&eacute;ene daies; and so they did, during the time of hir abiding there. The earle of Huntleie
<note place="marg">The ladie Huntleie is sent vnto the qu&eacute;ene.</note>
sent his wife in message to the qu&eacute;ene and councell, but she was not admitted to come
within a mile of them, but commanded to returne. After this, he sent a messenger, offering
to enter in ward till his cause might be tried by the whole nobilitie: but this was refused.
In the meane time all the principall of the Gordons that were landed men, were charged to

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 17.</note>
determined to flie to the mounteins: but after (trusting to the promises of his friends) he determined to abide battell in a place of some strength. Wherevpon in October he came with
his armie to Cornethie in Mar. By reason whereof the earle of Murreie, who at the first
had scarse a hundred horssemen with him, began with Iames Dowglasse earle of Moorton,
and Patrike Lindseie, to lead an armie against his enimies, and gathered a greater number of
eight hundred people of the regions adioining. Wherefore he first placed souldiers about
the water passages, to k&eacute;epe all those places, that Huntleie should not escape, and with the rest
went forward on a soft pase, to m&eacute;et his enimie: whose comming Huntleie did abide, with
thr&eacute;e hundred men k&eacute;eping their places, although not a few of that companie were fled from
the Gordons the night before.</p>
<p>When the earle of Murreie was come to the side of a hill, from whence he might s&eacute;e
all the marishes about him, he incamped there in a slender order of battell. At length the
armies met, at what time manie on the earle of Murreie his side did fl&eacute;e awaie, hauing before giuen a signe to the enimie. But the earle Murreie, which saw there was no succour
in fl&eacute;eing, stood to it valiantlie, called his men togither, set vpon the enimie, caused them
(which before followed his men fleeing awaie) now to flie as fast backe as they came forward. Which change of fortune when the traitors that before fled did perceiue, they came
afresh and pursued the Huntleies, and (to cleare them from the first fault) committed all the
slaughter that was doone that daie.</p>
<p>There was killed of the part of Huntleie a hundred and twentie, and a hundred taken:
but on the other side not one. Amongst such as were taken, was the earle Huntleie himselfe, and his two sons, Iohn and Adam. But the father being old and short breathed
by reason of his grossenes, was slaine betweene the hands of such as tooke him, and the
rest were late in the night brought to Aberden.] The qu&eacute;ene s&eacute;emed sorie for the earles
death. But in Nouember Iohn Gordon was beheaded in Aberden, and shortlie after the

qu&eacute;ene returned southwards, leauing foure commissioners in Aberden, the treasuror, maister
Iames Macgill, maister Iohn Spens of Cundie, and the lard of Pettarow, to compound for
the eschets of them that were in the field with the earle of Huntleie. Great summes of
monie were taken and leuied of them for that trespasse. * The earle Bothwell was

therefore at the qu&eacute;enes comming into Scotland) he did not absteine from hearing and saieng masse, was committed prisoner to the castell of Edenburgh, and the rest that were found

deliuerie of the castell of Hamilton. But (he returning without the effect of his message) they
addresse themselues to warre. At what time the lords of the congregation were at some variance amongest themselues, as seuered into diuerse opinions: for the Hamiltons that were
of greatest power in those places, did affirme, that "they should haue no firme conditions of
peace, except the king and qu&eacute;ene were made awaie: for so long as they were in health, they
could hope for nothing but new warres, new deceipts, and dissembled peace; a thing farre
more dangerous than open war. For though manie times the iniuries of priuat persons maie
<note place="marg">Wicked counsell alwaies woorst to the giuer.</note>
be laied downe by trauell and persuasion, and maie be recompensed againe with great
commodities: yet there is no waie to appease the displeasure of kings, but by taking them
awaie."</p>
<p>Vpon which bad speech, the earles of Murreie and of Glencarne (which well vnderstood
that the Hamiltons did not s&eacute;eke the publike commoditie, but their owne priuat riches as
persons that were next to the crowne after the queens death) did abhor the slaughter and gouernement of the Hamiltons, whom of late they had felt to be both cruell and couetous:
and did therefore giue more mild and sound counsell, saieng that "this dissention being ciuill,
was not yet come to be bloudie: in which hitherto they had onelie contended with words &amp;
not with swords, being not yet so far, but that (if it were possible) the same might be ended
with honest conditions.</p>
<p>"To the persuasion whereof, he said that there were manie in the camps of the two
princes, which gr&eacute;edilie desired to heare of peace, &amp; would not faile to further their endeuor therein, nor to defend themselues &amp; their cause with n&eacute;edfull weapons: all which did
perchance fores&eacute;e that the king and qu&eacute;ene (by reason of their youth) had not yet faulted so
greatlie, as that it turned to the vtter ouerthrow of the common-wealth; &amp; if they haue
faults (as who hath not) they were such as were rather to their owne priuat reproch than
otherwise, and therefore they ought not to be punished with flat death: but rather to be cured
with easier remedies. For he did remember it to haue alwaies beene obserued heretofore,
that in the life of kings, we should alwaies couer their secret vices, we should mildlie interpret their doubtfull faults, and we should with patience beare their knowne euills: so that
they did not by them bring vtter destruction to the common-wealth."</p>
<p>When this opinion was pleasing to most of the hearers, the other Hamiltons (except
Iames, which was head of that familie) determined to rest in quiet; but he accompanied
with sixt&eacute;ene horsses remained with the lords. Who being now so weakened of their power,
that they could neither wage battell, nor safelie passe to their owne; did giue place to the
time, and went that night to Hamilton.] The qu&eacute;ene assembled an armie, and went to
Glascow to pursue them [at what time (as saith Buchanan) the earle of Lennox was made
<note place="marg">An armie gathered against them.</note>

<note place="marg">The lords went vnto Dunfreis.</note>
warden of the east marches, and the duke and earles with other of their companie came to
Edenburgh, where the castell shot off at them, and therefore they departed towards Dunfreis,
and were receiued by the lord Heris.</p>
<p>The qu&eacute;ene hearing thereof, by aduise of hir councell assembled foorth of all the parts of
the whole realme an armie, appointing the same to be at Beggar, in the beginning of October, to pursue the rebels. In the meane time, she hearing that the towns of saint Andrews,
<note place="marg">Certeine townes are punished.</note>
Dund&eacute;e, and saint Iohns towne, had helped the lords to raise men of warre for their support, passed thither hirselfe, and tooke inquisition thereof, giuing order in those townes, that
no such thing should afterwards be put in practise. But there were none that suffered death
for that matter; but diuerse were committed to prison in the north parts of the realme, as
the prouost and bailzzeis of saint Andrews: also certeine of the towne of Dund&eacute;e, and saint
Iohns towne, and other were banished; and diuerse barons, as Lundie, Lango, and Balward, were sent to Aberden, and to other parts, where they remained the winter following.</p>

for the armie, and departing from Edenburgh, came to Beggar, where all the noble men

Roths, the lord Ochiltre, the abbat of Kilwinning, the lards of Grange, Cuningham, Herdie,

Dauid Chalmer chancellor of Rosse into France to the king, with letters for his assistance
against hir rebels. And shortlie after, the French king sent a gentleman called monsieur
Maluoiser into Scotland, with verie friendlie letters vnto the qu&eacute;ene, promising his helpe &amp;
assistance against the rebels; which message was most thankefullie receiued, and the said
Maluoiser honorablie at his departure rewarded.</p>

will, and so he obteined pardon for him and his friends, with licence to passe into France,
there to remaine the space of fiue yeares, and shortlie after he passed through England, and
so ouer into France, according to his appointment.</p>

being arriued in warlike manner, the lord Ruthen declared vnto the queene, that they would
not suffer hir anie longer to haue the gouernement of the realme, to abuse the same by the
counsell of strangers, as she had doone: and therefore pulled violentlie out of hir chamber Dauid Richeo an Italian, that was one of hir secretaries, crieng pitiouslie, '<emph>Iustitia,</emph>

in that behalfe was broken: for by secret conference with the king, she persuaded him to

thinke, that h&eacute;e had ioined himselfe with those that would be his destruction, if it happened with hir otherwise than well; as was no lesse to be doubted, by reason of the high displeasure that she had taken being quicke with child: through the which persuasion, and
<note place="marg">The king was soone persuaded.</note>
other misliking of things, he departed secretlie with hir in the night season, accompanied
onlie with two men, and first came vnto Seiton, and afterward from thence to Dunbar.</p>
<p>Thither the earles of Huntleie and Bothwell hastilie repaired, by whose counsell and others
<note place="marg">Huntleie and Bothwell.</note>

<note place="marg">Proclamation made.</note>
then with hir, she caused proclamation to be made in diuerse parts of the realme, charging
all manner of men in feats of warre, to come vnto hir to Dunbar, &amp; to passe from thence
vnto Edenburgh within six daies after. She also sent letters to the same effect vnto diuerse
noble men of the realme, who prepared themselues with great diligence to m&eacute;et hir. The
earle of Murreie and the rest of the lords being with him, hearing the preparation that
was made against them, and perceiuing themselues not able to resist, thought good euerie
of them to seeke some particular meane to obteine remission at the qu&eacute;ens hands. Which
<note place="marg">Pardon is craued and obteined.</note>

<note place="marg">The murtherers are excepted.</note>
they obteined all of them, except the earle of Morton, the lords Ruthwen, Lindseie, and
such other as were with them at the murther of Dauid Richeo. Wherevpon they desparing of pardon, fled into England; where the lord Ruthwen died at Newcastell shortlie
after; as in place ye shall heare.</p>
<p>The earle of Lennox, being partaker with them, came to Dunbar, and got pardon: the
<note place="marg">Manie pardoned.</note>
earle of Glenearne and the lard of Cunningham head came thither also, and were pardoned.
Likewise the earle of Rothes purchased his pardon at the same time. The earles of Argile
and Murreie, and the lord Boid, being at Lithquo, sent to the qu&eacute;ene for their pardon, and

obteined it, being commanded neuerthelesse to passe into Argile, and to remaine there during hir graces pleasure, which commandement they obeied. The eight&eacute;enth of March, the
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene commeth to Edenburgh.</note>
qu&eacute;ene well accompanied came to Hadington towards night: and on the ninet&eacute;enth day,
the bishop of saint Andrews, and the Hamiltons met hir at Muskelburgh, and so likewise did
the lords Leuingston, Fleming, Hume, Borthwike, and manie other noble men, and conueied
hir vnto Edenburgh.</p>
<p>She lodged in the bishop of Dunkelds lodging, and taried there a certeine space, hauing
with hir the erls of Huntleie, Atholl, Bothwell, Crawford, Marshall, Southerland, Cathnes,
the bishops of saint Andrews and Rosse; the lords Leuingston, Fleming, and diuerse other
noble men, by whose counsell order was taken for redressing of the state of the realme,
whereby the same was shortlie brought to great quietnesse. After this, the qu&eacute;ene perceiuing hirselfe to draw neere the time of hir deliuerance, went to the castell of Edenburgh, there
to remaine till sh&eacute;e were deliuered of hir birth. In the moneth of Maie, Thomas Scot shiriffe, deputie of Perth, &amp; a priest called sir Henrie Yair, seruant to the lord Ruthwen, were
apprehended for being dooers in the slaughter of Dauid, and were hanged and quartered.
<note place="marg">Execution doone vpon the murtherers.</note>
Their heads were set aloft, the one on the tower in the abbeie, and the other on the

<p>In the moneth of Aprill this y&eacute;ere, the bishop of Brechin president of the session, deceassed,
and in his roome succ&eacute;eded to that bishoprike, a friend and cousine to the earle of Argile
called Campbell. In the end of Aprill, the qu&eacute;ene, willing to haue the earles of Argile
and Murreie ioined with the rest of the councell, sent for them to come to the castell of
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene agr&eacute;eth all the lords.</note>
Edenburgh, where all griefs and controuersies that rested betwixt them on the one side, and
the earles of Huntleie, Atholl, &amp; Bothwell on the other side, were referred to the qu&eacute;ene,
who agreed them, and they all remained with hir the residue of the summer. The queene
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene made sute to the qu&eacute;ene of England.</note>
hearing that the earle of Morton, the lord Ruthwen, and the other their assistants were receiued in England, and remained at New castell; sh&eacute;e sent maister Iames Thornton chantor
of Murreie, with letters to the queene of England, and also to the king of France, and other
hir friends there; declaring by the tenor of the same letters the abuse and presumptuous attempts of certeine hir subiects against hir, desiring them not to receiue them within their
realmes or dominions.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, the queene of England sent a gentleman called Henrie Killigrew into 
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene of England hir answer.</note>
Scotland, with letters and message to the queene, promising to cause them to depart foorth
of hir realme of England: and withall sent vnto them warning to depart betwixt that present time, and midsummer then next insuing. But in the meane time the lord Ruthwen
<note place="marg">The lord Ruthwen repented.</note>
departed this life at Newcastell, with great repentance of his former life: giuing God thanks,
for that he had lent him time to call to him for mercie and forgiuenesse, whereof he did
assure himselfe. And from thencefoorth the earle of Morton, and the maister of Ruthwen,
remained secretlie neere to Anwike, and other places of the borders, till they obteined pardon, and were restored. About this time there came from the king of France, a wise aged
<note place="marg">An ambassage from the king of France.</note>
gentleman, named monsieur la Crocke, as his ambassador, and remained in Scotland all the
winter following.</p>
<p>In the moneth of Iune, the qu&eacute;ene perceiuing the time of hir deliuerance to approch,
wrote vnto all the principall noble men of hir realme, to come and remaine within the
towne of Edenburgh, during the time of hir deliuerance, where they assembled: and the king
hir husband, with the earles of Argile, Murreie, Atholl, and Mar, remained with hir in the
castell; and the earle of Huntleie, Bothwell, and the remnant of the lords lodged in the
towne. And vpon the nint&eacute;enth day of the same moneth of Iune, betwixt 10 and 11 of
the clocke before noone, hir grace was deliuered of a goodlie man-child, to the great 
<note place="marg">A prince borne.</note>
comfort of hir highnesse, and all hir subiects, whereof the nobilitie did greatlie reioise. And
incontinentlie all the artillerie in the castell was shot off, and all the lords and people came
togither in the church of saint Giles, to giue thanks to almightie God for his great and beneficiall goodnes shewed to them, in giuing to them a prince, and withall made their

humble praiers vnto his diuine maiestie, to indue him with the feare of God, with vertue and
knowledge to gouerne the realme and subiects thereof, when soeuer the same should fall into
his hands.</p>
<p>The same night at &eacute;euen, there were great fires for ioy made in the towne of Edenburgh,
and in all the countrie about, and likewise through all the whole realme, as by aduertisements
were certified therof. The queene remained still in the castell of Edenburgh all the moneth
of Iulie following, till sh&eacute;e had recouered hir health and strength. In the beginning of August, she passed vp the water of Forth to Allowaie, where she remained certeine daies, the
earles of Murreie and Mar being of companie with hir, and there the king hir husband
came to visit hir. The same time monsieur Maluoisir came into Scotland from the king of
France, bringing letters to the qu&eacute;ene, who was conueied by the bishop of Rosse to Allowaie, where he was ioifullie receiued, courteouslie interteined, and highly rewarded. The
queene of England sent maister Henrie Killegrew to the qu&eacute;ene with the like message, reioising for hir safe and happie deliuerance, who likewise was receiued in most thankefull maner, and well rewarded.</p>
<p>Here is to be noted, that shortlie after she was brought to bed, she sent one of hir 
<note place="marg">The princes godfathers &amp; godmothers.</note>
gentlemen called monsieur Clarimoich, with letters to the king of France, and to the duke of
Sauoie: desiring them to send ambassadors, which in their name (as godfathers) might receiue hir son at the baptisme. Moreouer, she sent Iames Meluine to the qu&eacute;ene of England with the like message, desiring hir maiestie to be godmother [who by hir ambassador

Francis earle of Bedford, sent a present to the qu&eacute;ene of Scots, (as I. Stow hath noted) a
fount of gold curiouslie wrought &amp; inamelled, weieng 333 ounces, amounting in value
to 1043 pounds 19 shillings of English monie.] These princes were glad hereof, and promised to send ambassadors to that effect, as afterward they did. In the later end of August,
the qu&eacute;ene accompanied with the king hir husband, the erles of Huntleie, Murreie, Bothwell, and diuerse other, went into Meggat land, there to passe the time in hunting, where
they remained certeine daies: and returning to Edenburgh, caused the prince to bee conueied vnto Striueling castell, where he was committed in k&eacute;eping to the lord Erskin, after
erle of Mar, and his ladie. And from thence the qu&eacute;ene went on progresse into Glen
Arkeneie.</p>

go to ledworth to assemble a parlement. About the beginning of October, Bothwell prepareth a iournie into Liddisdaie, where he was hurt with a caleeuer by a base th&eacute;efe. Whervpon with vncerteine life he was caried to the castell of Hermitage, to which the qu&eacute;ene
(hearing of his mishap) came, attended with a small traine from Borthwike, and from thence
hauing s&eacute;ene Bothwell, did in short time after returne to Borthwike, whither sh&eacute;e caused
Bothwell to b&eacute;e brought: after whose comming thither, the qu&eacute;ene fell so grieuouslie sicke,
that she was in danger of hir life, at what time the king came thither unto hir.</p>
<p>In Ianuarie the king came to Glascow, where he fell sicke, and remoouing from thence
<note place="marg"><date>1567.</date></note>
went to Edenburgh, and the qu&eacute;ene accompanied him. She lodged at Holie rood house,
but h&eacute;e was lodged at a house within the towne, neere to the Kirke a field, within the
which, on the tenth of the moneth of Februarie in the night he was shamefullie 
<note place="marg">The king murthered.</note>

<note place="marg">1566. <emph>Stow.</emph></note>
murthered, togither with one William Parat. He was cast into an orchard, and herewith the house
was blowne vp with gunpowder. [Some giue report of his death, but touch not the maner
thereof, onelie saieng that he was shamefullie murthered in a morning (a heauie breakefast)
by his owne (but vnnaturall and rebellious) people, whose innocent blood crieth out for
vengeance at the hands of God, who in iustice will (when he s&eacute;eth due time) giue them their
portion with malefactors agr&eacute;eable to their merits.</p>
<p>The earle of Bothwell was euen at the first vehementlie suspected to be the principall

offendor in this most heinous and detestable murther. But the matter was so handled, that
he was not onelie acquit by an assise, as they call it; but also shortlie after maried the qu&eacute;ene.
By reason wherof, the suspicion that men had alreadie conceiued, that she should be also

priuie to the murther, was nothing diminished. But as I haue not to deale in that matter,
so yet it is manifest, that some of the Scotish nobilitie, sore repining and maligning at such
the speedie aduancement of Bothwell, who (as euerie man persuaded himselfe, was the
principall author of the murther) got them to armes on the sudden, before the qu&eacute;ene or
Bothwell were aduertised of their meaning, they being then at Borthwike castell, eight miles
<note place="marg">The lords get them to armes.</note>
distant from Edenburgh.</p>
<p>* Thus leauing the lords awhile at Edenburgh, we will say somewhat out of Buchanan,
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
of things doone by Bothwell &amp; the qu&eacute;ene, before that she was taken by these noble men
of the congregation, hauing at that time taken armes against hir. After the death of hir husband, whome she had caused to be buried not farre from Dauid Richeo hir secretarie, slaine
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. li.</emph> 17.</note>
(as was thought) by the meanes of the king of Scots: the queene (I say) after that, and
also after the clearing of Bothwell from the murther of hir husband, was forceablie taken
(as she was on hir iournie) by the earle Bothwell, and caried to his castell, where she remained not long, but yet honorablie interteined. Which fact of his bred great mislike in
the peoples minds, and brought him in danger of his life, had not the queene (of hir clemencie) pardoned him the same.</p>
<p>This doone, there was a consultation had for a mariage to be solemnized betw&eacute;ene hir
and the earle Bothwell, which (after a diuorse had betw&eacute;ene this earle and his then wife
Katharine Gordon, granted by the iudges spirituall &amp; temporall; and after the solemne
bands asked betweene the said earle Iames Hepborne, and the qu&eacute;ene Marie Steward) was
with great solemnitie of the nobilitie (by their hands in writing consenting therevnto)
consummat at Edenburgh. Against which onelie the bishop of Orkenie was found to
resist; and at which monsieur de Crocke the French ambassador then in Scotland would
not be present: being a thing which did greatly occasion the Edenburgers to mislike of the
queene.</p>
<p>Which mariage br&eacute;eding some euill opinion of the said qu&eacute;ene of Scots, not onelie in hir
owne realme, but in the mouths of forreine nations, shee wiselie consulteth with hir friends,
how she might establish hir power, and prouide to saue hirselfe and hir kingdome from
tumults and insurrections. Wherevpon, first she determineth to send an ambassador into
France, to reconcile the minds of the king, and of the Guises, offended with this mariage.
Which office of ambassage was laid vpon William bishop of Dunblane, with this charge (as
saith Buchanan) almost word for word.</p>
<p>"First, you shall excuse to the king, and to our vncles, that our mariage (to be consummate) came to their eares, before that we had opened our counsell touching that matter by
anie messengers. This excuse (as it were to a foundation) dooth leane to the true exposition of his whole life, and chieflie to the offices and duties of the duke or capteine of the
Orcades towards vs, euen vnto that day in which it s&eacute;emed good to vs to take him to husband. For the opening of the historie whereof you shall take occasion to treat from the
beginning of the last times of his adolescencie (youth, or y&eacute;eres of discretion, as w&eacute;e terme it)
in this sort.</p>
<p>"That when he first began to manage his owne affaires (being from the death of his
father one of the chiefe of the nobilitie) he did wholie dedicate himselfe to the dutie and
seruice of the princes and kings of Scotland, as one borne of a famous familie for his ancient nobilitie, &amp; of great reuenues in this kingdome which he possesseth by right of inheritance. At that time also he did especiallie and altogither consecrate himselfe to our mother,
whilest she had the gouernement of the realme.</p>
<p>"In which dutie towards hir, he did so constantlie perseuere, that although the greater
part of the nobilitie, and almost all the townes were fallen from hir obedience (vnder the
colour of religion) yet h&eacute;e would neuer decline from hir authoritie, as a person that could
not be woone by anie promises or benefits, or feared with anie threats, or losse of his liuings,
to neglect his dutie in anie part vnto hir: but that he wuld rather suffer his principall
house, which was the head of his patrimonie, with his plentifull and pretious store of

furniture thereof to be taken from him, and all his other lands to be left for spoile to the enimie,
than violate his faith to our mother. Besides which, being destitute of helpe both of vs
and our people (when the English host was brought by our domesticall enimies into the
bowels of our kingdome, which directed their weapons to none other marke, than that our
now husband at that time earle Bothwell, should by force be inforced to flie) he fled into
France, forsaking all his patrimonie, where he honored me with all dutie and seruice (that
h&eacute;e might) vntill my returne into Scotland.</p>
<p>"Neither are those exploits to be omitted, which were doone by him in the warres against
the English before my returne into mine owne countrie, where he shewed such parts of
warlike valure and graue wisedome, that he was iudged (being then verie yoong) m&eacute;et to
haue the gouernment of ancient persons, to be made chiefe capteine of the armie of the
countrie, &amp; also to be chosen or substitute deputie and chancellor: as in truth he was. In
which office he did not deceiue the hope and expectation which men conceiued of him.
For (by his affaires valiantlie atchiued) he left a singular praise and fame of him, as well
amongst his owne people, as amongst the enimies.</p>
<p>"After our returne into Scotland, he emploied all his indeuor to the inlarging of our
authoritie, and spared not to put himselfe in danger, in subduing those rebels which dwell
about the borders of England. The dispatch wherof being shortlie performed, and they
brought to great quiet, he was appointed to doo the like in all the other parts of the kingdome.
But as enuie dooth alwaies accompanie vertue, so the Scots repining thereat, and desirous
of innouation, did labor to diminish our fauour towards him (for his great labors imploied
in our behalfe) in misconstruing his good deeds.</p>
<p>"By which in the end they wrought so much with me, that we committed him to prison;
partlie to satisfie the minds of such as were emulous against him, and could not brooke
the increase of his following honor and greatnesse; and partlie to appease such seditions as
were likelie then to breake foorth to the destruction of the whole kingdome. But he
(escaping out of prison) got him into France, to giue place to the power of his enimies,
where he remained almost two y&eacute;eres next following. At what time the authors of the
former sedition, forgetting my clemencie towards them, and their dutie towards vs, did raise
warre, and tooke weapons against their qu&eacute;ene.</p>
<p>"From thence was he called backe into Scotland, &amp; being restored to his former honors
&amp; possessions, he was againe made generall of all the armie: by whose helpe our authoritie
began afresh so to florish, that all the rebels (suddenlie forsaking their countrie) were inforced to flie into England, vntill part of them vpon humble submission were receiued anew
into our fauour. But how traitorouslie I was handled by the rest that were restored (and
especiallie such, whose ancestors I had with benefits most promoted) our vncle is not
ignorant, and therefore we will touch that no more.</p>
<p>"Neither is it to be ouerpassed in silence, with what diligence he deliuered me from the
hands of such as deteined me prisoner, and with what speed (and singular prouidence of
his) I did both escape from prison, and recouered my former authoritie: after that I had
dispersed the factions of the coniurators and seditious persons. In which trulie I am inforced to confesse, that his dutie and diligence at that time shewed towards me, was so
acceptable vnto me, that I could neuer after forget it. These things although they be
great of themselues, yet he hath hitherto increased them with such diligence and carefulnesse, that we cannot desire greater dutie, or wish more assured trust in anie man, than
we haue found in him; vntill these last times which followed the deceasse of our husband.</p>
<p>"But from that time, as his thoughts did s&eacute;eme to tend higher, so his actions did after
a sort s&eacute;eme to be more insolent. And although the matter went so far, that we were to
take all things in the best part: yet these things did then most greeuouslie offend me;
but especiallie his arrogancie, in that he thought that there were not other sufficient abilities
in vs, to recompense his deseruings, vnlesse we gaue our selfe to him in mariage. Touching which, at the first he vsed secret reasons and counsels: but in the end, when he saw

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"them"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"622"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

them not to succeed after his mind, at length, shewing an open contempt of my authoritie,
he fled to the benefit of violence, and vsed force (to the end his attempt might not want
due effect) to bring me vnder his gouernement.</p>
<p>"Wherefore all this course of his life maie be an example, to shew how craftilie
they can contriue their drifts (in attempting great things) vntill they haue obteined their
purpose. For I did suppose, that all this his continuall dutie and carefulnesse in sp&eacute;edie
obeieng of my commandements, had not issued from anie other founteine, than of a vehement desire to shew his obedience and good will towards me: neither did I hope that a
litle more fauourable countenance (which we are accustomed to vse to the more woorthie
persons, to the end to win their minds to be more obedient to vs in dutie) should so haue
raised his stomach (more than anie others) that he would promise to himselfe anie larger
good will to proc&eacute;ed from me towards him, than he had before.</p>
<p>"But he taking aduantage of all haps, &amp; drawing all things (that chanced) to the
furtherance of his purpose, and k&eacute;eping all his counsels secret from me, did still shew his
accustomed dutie, nourished my old fauour to him, &amp; secretlie attempted a new thing by
the helpe of the nobilitie. Which he brought to passe with such sp&eacute;edie diligence, that
(vnknowen to me) he obteined of the p&eacute;eres of the realme (in the assemblie of the parlement h&eacute;ere) a writing with all their hands set therevnto, for the more credit of the same.
In which writing was conteined, that they did not onlie assent vnto the mariage; but that
they also further promised to spend their life and goods (offered to all dangers) in the executing thereof, and that they would be vtter enimies to all such as should labor to hinder
it. For the more easie obteining of whose consent in this sort, he had persuaded the said
nobilitie, that the same was not doone against my mind and consent. At length, when he
had purchased this writing from them, he began by litle and little (with earnest intreaties
&amp; flatteries) to obteine our consent. But when at the first our answers did not content his
desire, he began to laie before me almost all those things, which are accustomed to happen
in the attempt of such matters.</p>
<p>"First, the outward tokens of our good fauour towards him, the reasons by which our
friends or his enimies might hinder the same, &amp; manie other things which being obiected
or willinglie happening, might frustrate his hope, or change the minds of such as had before
subscribed. At length (fortune fauouring him therein) he determined to pursue the matter,
&amp; in one instance to hazard his hope and life about the same. Wherefore, when he had
determined with himselfe, with all importunitie to attempt the successe of his determination,
he foure daies after hauing conuenient time and place therefore in the high waie, set vpon
me with a strong band, as I was comming from s&eacute;eing of my d&eacute;ere sonne, and with great
sp&eacute;ed caried me to Dunbar.</p>
<p>"Which euill d&eacute;ed how gr&eacute;euouslie we tooke (especiallie doone by him, from whome
all our subiects neuer looked to haue such things to proc&eacute;ed) euerie bodie maie easilie consider. For there I did vpbraid him, with what auour I haue alwaies vsed him, what honorable opinion I haue had of him and of his conditions in my sp&eacute;ech vsed to others, and
of his vnthankefulnesse to me therefore; with all other things that might deliuer me out of
his hands. These matters I laied against him with bitter words. But his answers therevnto were more mild, and tempered with gentler sp&eacute;eches, in this, that he would still vse
all honor and dutie towards vs, and labor by all means to haue our good will, whom he
would not offend.</p>
<p>"As touching this, that he had against our will caried vs into one of our own castels, he
humblie craued pardon therefore (in that he was inforced therevnto) although in the same
he had forgotten that reuerence and dutie, which euerie subiect owght vnto vs. Wherevnto
he added, that he did the same for our safetie and defense. At which time also he began
to repeat vnto me the whole course of his life, lamenting his fortune, to haue them (whome
he neuer hurt) so gr&eacute;euouslie offended with him, that their malice had not ouerpassed
anie occasions vniustlie to hurt him withall.</p>

<p>"But especiallie in this, that their great enuie had burdened him with the murther of
the king, and that his power was vnequall to resist the secret conspiracies of his enimies,
whome he could not know; because they did in shew and sp&eacute;eches dissemble their friendship: &amp; not knowing them, there was no waie for him to fores&eacute;e and auoid their deceipts.
Whose extreme hatred was now growen to such height, that he could not liue in safetie in anie
place, or at anie time, except he might be assured of the qu&eacute;enes vnchangeable fauour
towards him. Which certeintie of hir fauor could not be shewed but by this one meane,
to persuade hir selfe to receiue him into the mariage bed. At what time he did most holilie
sweare, that he gaped not after anie extraordinarie gouernement, or that he would leape to
the highest step of supreme rule thereby; but onlie to reape this fruit thereof, that he
might serue and obeie hir as long as he liued, in such sort as he did before. Whervnto he
added the delights of such sp&eacute;eches as that matter required.</p>
<p>"But in the end, when he saw that we could not be mooued therevnto, either with praiers
or promises, he shewed vnto vs what he had doone with the whole nobilitie, and the chiefe
of the parlement, and what they againe had promised vnder their hands. Which being
suddenlie and vnhoped for laied against vs, whether it did with iust cause greatlie astonish
vs, we leaue to the consideration of the king, the qu&eacute;ene, our vncles, and the rest of our
friends. Wherefore, when I perceiued my selfe a prisoner vnder the power of an other man,
farre from the helpe of all those whose counsell I did and should haue vsed; yea and that
I saw them before my face, in whose former faith and wisedome I did repose my selfe;
whose strength did defend our authoritie, and without which our power was but small or
none: when (I say) I had seene all those to haue vowed themselues to serue his desire,
and that I was alone left a preie for him, I did with my selfe in my mind consider manie
things, but could bring none of them to effect.</p>
<p>"Besides which, he gaue to vs but short time to take anie aduise, but incontinentlie and
importunatlie did still vrge the same vnto me. At length, when I saw no waie to 'escape by
flight, nor anie person of all our kingdome which had anie care of our libertie (for we well
perceiued by their hands giuen, and by their deepe silence at that time, that they were all
drawen to take his part) I was compelled (after that I a little pacified mine anger, &amp; displeasure against him) to refer my selfe to the discusse and consideration of his demands, &amp;
to laie before my selfe his dutie in times past, and the hope which we had of the following
continuance of the same towards vs.</p>
<p>"And further, how greeuouslie our people would suffer a strange king, and heauilie receiue one vnacquainted, and not invred with their lawes and customs, that they would not
suffer me long to liue vnmaried, and that the people (being by nature factious) could not
be kept in obedience, except our authoritie were supported and practised by a man which
could equall them in bearing labor, and were able to bridle the insolencie of rebels in the
administration of the common wealth: the weight of which charge, our power (being
weakened and almost brought to nothing by continuall tumults and rebellions, since our
comming into Scotland) was not able anie longer to susteine. For by reason of these seditions, we were inforced to appoint foure or more deputies in diuerse parts of our realmes,
which afterward also did (vnder the colour of the authoritie which they were permitted to
vse vnder vs) inforce our owne subiects to take armes against vs.</p>
<p>"For all which causes, when we well perceiued that if we labored to preserue the dignitie
of kinglie maiestie, that they would inforce me to mariage, that our people could not abide
a forren prince, and that amongest our owne subiects, there was not anie which for the nobilitie of his familie, for his wisdome and valure, or for other vertues of bodie and mind,
might be preferred before or equalled vnto him, I commanded my selfe to ioine with the
whole consent of the parlement, and assemblie of the nobilitie before mentioned. After
that my former constant determination was thus somewhat mollified by these and other reasons, he did wring from me partlie by force, and partlie by intreatie, a promise to him
of mariage.</p>

<p>"Which doone, we could not yet by anie meanes and persuasion obteine of him (fearing
an alteration in our mind) that the time wherein this mariage should be performed, might
be deferred so long, as that we might participat the same with the king and qu&eacute;ene of France,
and such other friends as we had remaining in those parts. For he beginning with a bold
attempt (after that he had once thereby atteined the first step of his desire) did neuer after
that ceasse to ioine importunat praiers to his persuasions and arguments of reason, vntill he
did without violence inforce vs to set end to the woorke begun, and that at such time, and
after such order, as seemed most conuenient vnto him for the execution of his determination.
In which matter I cannot dissemble, but that I was otherwise intreated by him, than either
I would or had deserued.</p>
<p>"For he was more carefull to satisfie them, by whose consent (shewed at the beginning)
he thought himselfe to haue obteined his purpose (though he did both deceiue them and
m&eacute;e) than to gratifie me, or to weie how meet it were for me, being brought vp in the
precepts and rites of our religion; from which, neither he nor anie man liuing, whilest I
did liue, could draw me awaie (aliue) by anie action. In which thing trulie, though we
doo acknowledge our error, yet we willinglie desire, that the king and qu&eacute;ene his mother,
our vncle, or anie friend of ours, doo not expostulat with him, nor anie waie laie the fault
vnto his charge.</p>
<p>"For sith things be now so ended, as that they cannot be againe vndoone, we take all
things in the best part: &amp; as he is in d&eacute;ed, so he is to be accounted our husband, whome
from henceforwards we haue determined both to loue &amp; reuerence. Wherefore all they
which professe themselues to be our friends, must also shew the like to him which is ioined
vnto vs with an indissoluble knot. And although he hath in manie things behaued himselfe
lesse diligentlie, &amp; almost ouer-rashlie, which we willinglie impute to his immoderat affection
towards vs; yet we desire the king, the qu&eacute;ene, our vncle, and the rest of our friends, no
lesse to loue and fauor him, than if all things had till this day b&eacute;ene doone after their aduise and determination; in the behalfe of which our husband, we promise that he shall in
all things (which shal be required of him hereafter) alwaies gratifie them in what he maie."</p>
<p>These remedies being found to defend the qu&eacute;ens credit amongst forren princes, other
remedies were to be sought for defense of hir owne person against hir owne subiects.
Wherefore (after that the earle of Murreie was appointed to remaine as banished beyond the
seas in France, whither he tooke his iournie through England) the qu&eacute;ene (deliuered of
such a feare as he was to hir, &amp; therfore better able to rule, or at least to make better shift,
with such other as were coniured, to vse Buchanans word, against hir) vsed what diligence
she might to gather forces, especiallie in the Mers and east of Louthian.]</p>
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene gathereth forces.</note>
<p>And thinking that the enterprise of the lords had beene broken and disappointed, they
marched from Dunbar on saturdaie, the fourth of Iune, first to Hathington, &amp; there resting
till the euen, set forward to Gladismore, and taking there deliberation in the matter; they
lodged that night at Seiton, and in the morning marched in order of battell towards Carbarrie hill, and there chose foorth a plot of ground of great aduantage, appointing to fight

Seiton, Yester, and Borthwike; also the lards of Wauchton, Bas, Ormiston, Weaderburne,
Blackater, and Langton. They had with them also two hundred harquebusiers waged, and
of great artillerie some field p&eacute;eces. Their whole number was est&eacute;emed to be about 2000:

quarrell. Vpon the fifteenth of Iune, they came foorth of the towne, and approched their

aduersaries. But there was monsieur la Croque, the French kings ambassadour, who tooke
great paine, in trauelling betwixt the parties to reduce them to some agr&eacute;ement. *Who
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
by his interpretor laid before them how carefullie he had studied for the commoditie &amp; tranquillitie of the publike state of Scotland before this; and that now also he caried the same
<note place="marg"><emph>Bucha. lib.</emph> 18.</note>
mind with him. Wherefore he did vehementlie desire (if it were possible) that the matter
might be so taken vp, for the commoditie of both parties; that it might be ended without
force or bloudshed. For the compassing whereof, he would imploie all his trauell, sith the
qu&eacute;ene also did not refuse to heare the counsell &amp; persuasion of peace. For the more
certeintie wherof, he did at that time promise them pardon and vtter forgetfulnesse of all
things passed before time; &amp; did with great holinesse there pledge him selfe, that no hurt
should fall vnto anie man there, for taking weapon against the highest gouernor.</p>
<p>After that the interpretor had deliuered these things, the earle of Morton answered, that
he did not take armor against the qu&eacute;ene; but against him that had killed the king.
Whome if the queene would deliuer to punishment, or separat him from hir; she should
well vnderstand, that they &amp; the rest of hir subiects held nothing more d&eacute;ere vnto them,
than to continue in their dutifull obedience: without which granted to them, there could be
no agr&eacute;ement made; because they came not thither to craue pardon for anie offense which
they had committed (wherevnto the earle of Glencarne added) but rather to giue pardon
to such as had offended.]</p>
<p>Wherfore the ambassador Croque returned backe to Edenburgh, and the qu&eacute;ens part
began to decrease, diuerse shrinking awaie from hir; so that after it began to grow towards
the euening, Bothwell fled to the castell of Dunbar. But the qu&eacute;ene desirous to talke with
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene commeth to the lords.</note>
William Kircadie the lard of Grange, went to him, accompanied onelie with one capteine,
and after some talke with him, she passed to the lords, who tooke hir with them to Edenburgh, [she being in a short garment, base, &amp; worne, comming a little beneath hir knees
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
(as saith Buchanan) of which lords she requested that they would suffer hir to depart, &amp;
not to keepe hir in that sort.] The Hamiltons were on the waie comming to assist the
queene, with seuen or eight hundred horssemen; but before they could reach to the place,
the queene was in the hands of the lords, and so they returned.</p>
<p>The lard of Cragmiller [then prouost of Edenburgh] and sir Iames Balfure also the 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
capteine of the castell, were ioined in this confederacie with the lords, as shortlie after it appeared. The queene after this was conueied ouer the Forth, and brought to Lochleuin,
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene is sent to Lochleuin.</note>
where she was appointed to remaine in ward vnder the safe k&eacute;eping of William Dowglas
lard of that place. The earle Bothwell, escaping to Dunbar, found meanes to fl&eacute;e into
Denmarke, where he was staied and committed to prison, wherein at length he died. Diuerse
persons afterwards were apprehended as parties to the murther of the king, and therevpon
condemned, were executed, confessing the said earle to be the principall executor of the

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

obserued in all the kings of Scotland descended of the Stewards: that neuer anie one of

them except the first &amp; second king of that name was of the age of man, or of one and
twentie y&eacute;eres when they put on the kinglie ornaments. A rare thing, and not vnm&eacute;et to
be considered of, although we can not enter into the secret iudgements of God. The proofe
of which matter, being after this sort, I haue set downe in a catalog of the orderlie descent of
those kings. In the computation of the y&eacute;eres of whose age and first comming to the crowne
I haue followed Lesleus.</p>
<p>Robert Steward the first king of that surname, was 57 y&eacute;eres old when he began his reigne,
in the y&eacute;ere of our redemption 1370. Iohn Steward son of the said Robert began his reigne
1390. These two alone were of full age, when the title of the kingdome descended vnto
them. Iames Steward, the first of the name of Iames, &amp; the third of the name of Stewards, was
within age at the death of his father, when the title and crowne descended unto him: who
although he receiued not the crowne at Scone (because he was about eight&eacute;ene y&eacute;eres honorablie kept as a prisoner in England) vntill h&eacute;e was of mans age: yet being king in right, and
the crowne inuested in him when he was within age, I doubt not to make him king from the
death of his father, and so within age to haue obteined the kingdome, though not the kinglie vse thereof, beginning his reigne in the y&eacute;ere of our redemption 1424.</p>
<p>Iames the second, and the fourth of the Stewards, was six y&eacute;eres old when he was crowned, in the y&eacute;ere of Christ 1436. Iames the third, and fift of the Stewards, being seuen yeeres
old, was crowned king of Scotland in the y&eacute;ere that the word became flesh 1460. Iames
the fourth, and sixt of the Stewards, being sixt&eacute;ene yeeres of age, was adorned with the ensignes of the kingdome, in the y&eacute;ere of our saluation 1488. Iames the fift, and the
seuenth of the Stewards, being one y&eacute;ere, fiue moneths, and ten dais old, was crowned king
of Scotland, in the y&eacute;ere from the birth of Christ 1513. Marie the eight of the name of
Stewards, being but seuen daies old, was crowned queene of Scots, in the y&eacute;ere of Christ
1542. Henrie Steward, sonne to Mathew earle of Lennox, and husband to the said Marie
Steward, was not one and twentie y&eacute;eres old, when he came to be king in the right of his
wife Marie: for he was not past one and twentie when he was slaine, as before in the y&eacute;ere
1567. Charles Iames Steward, the sixt of the name of Iames, and the ninth of the surname of Stewards, sonne of the said Henrie Steward and Marie Steward, being about a
y&eacute;ere old, began his reigne in the y&eacute;ere that God became man 1567. To whome Andrew
Meluine (this y&eacute;ere 1585 in England) did whilest he was in Scotland dedicate these verses
following:

the discourse of these matters at large, with authoritie of scriptures and reasons, was set
foorth by Iohn Knox minister, and commanded to be printed by the generall assemblie, in the
y&eacute;ere of Christ 1569, being s&eacute;ene and allowed by those which follow, appointed to that function by the said assemblie: whose names were Iohn Willike, maister Iohn Crage, Robert
Pont, Iohn Row, Dauid Lindseie, William Christison, Iames Greg, &amp;c.</p>
<p>On the fift&eacute;enth of December a parlement begun, being holden at Edenburgh before
<note place="marg">A parlement holden at Edenburgh.</note>
the earle of Murreie lord regent, in the which diuers acts and statutes were deuised, made,
and ratified: as first concerning the qu&eacute;enes demission of hir crowne, and resignation thereof
made to hir sonne king Iames the sixt. And likewise concerning the instituting of the earle
of Murreie in the regencie of the realme, which he tooke vpon him the two and twentith day
of August last past, according to hir letters of commission and procuration aboue specified.
Also there was an act made for the abolishing of the pope, and his vsurped authoritie. And
<note place="marg">An act for the abolishing of the popes authoritie in Scotland.</note>
an other act for the annulling of former acts made in parlement for maintenance of superstition and idolatrie. And heereto was annexed a confession of the faith and doctrine receiued by the protestants of the realme of Scotland, authorised in the same parlement. There
was also an act made for the indemnitie of those that had leuied warre, and apprehended the
queene at Carbarrie hill, the fift&eacute;enth of Iulie last past, and concerning the deteining of hir
in Lochleuin.</p>
<p>Moreouer, it was ordeined by an act passed in this parlement, that the castell of Dunbar,
<note place="marg">The castell of Dunbar and the fortresse of Insketh to be raced.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 19.</note>
and the fortresse of Insketh, should be demolished and raced downe to the earth. To be
briefe, there were one and fortie acts or statutes made and stablished in this parlement, as by
the register thereof it maie app&eacute;ere. *In the first beginning of the spring, the gouernor determined to make a progresse ouer the realme, with the iudges that were appointed to administer law: which he ment to doo, to the end that he might amend and establish such things
as were indamaged by the tumults of the y&eacute;ere before. Which matter woorking diuerse
opinions in those of the qu&eacute;enes faction, did cause that Metallane and Iohn Balfurie sought
meanes to deliuer the qu&eacute;ene out of prison. Touching which matter also the Hamiltons labored who (being next to the crowne, if the yoong king were gone, and the qu&eacute;ene made
awaie, both which perhaps was no great matter to procure) did ioine with the queenes faction and fauourers. Whose part in like manner the earles of Atholl and Huntleie refused
not to take, because the mother of the one, and the wife of the other, were of the familie
of the Hamiltons.</p>
<p>William Murreie of Tillibartine, for his contrarie opinion in the controuersies of religion,
and for priuat quarrels, being estranged and grieued from and with the gouernor, did not
onelie now depart from the kings faction (although before he shewed great diligence in taking
the qu&eacute;ene) but did also draw with him a great companie of his friends intised therevnto with
no small hope of benefit to rise vnto them thereby. And as these were heads and chiefe of
such as sought the qu&eacute;enes deliuerance: so there were a great manie other, whom priuat necessitie, secret grudge, desire of reuenge, hope of aduancement, and n&eacute;erenesse of aliance
to those which are before named, procured to follow, and to further the cause of the qu&eacute;enes
libertie. In the meane time, whilest the regent was at Glascow to minister law to such as
required it (and that he had there heard of these things) this determination of setting the
qu&eacute;ene at libertie was put in execution, the manner whereof was in this sort. There was in
the castell of Lochleuin, wherein the qu&eacute;ene was kept as prisoner, the mother of the regent,
and thr&eacute;e of his brethren by an other father, with a great troope of women: but none were
admitted to see the qu&eacute;ene, saue such as were well knowen or sent thither by the regent.</p>
<p>Of all this houshold companie, there was none that s&eacute;emed so meet to the queene to execute anie matter, as was George Dowglas the yoongest brother of the regent, being a man
of a pleasant wit, and easilie to be ouertaken with the faire speeches of women. This man
had accesse vnto the qu&eacute;ene to plaie at cards, and to vse hir with other courtleie pastimes:
who determining to set hir at libertie, did with promises and gifts win the scruants of the castell to fauour him and his enterprises. Wherevpon this Dowglasse (not vnwitting as was

thought to his mother) omitteth nothing that might s&eacute;eme to serue for the queenes libertie:
the which although manie there did perceiue &amp; tooke not in verie good part, giuing intelligence therof to the regent; yet he gaue such credit to his owne people there, that he changed
(as hath Buchanan) none of the k&eacute;epers in that place, but onelie commanded his brother
George to depart out of the Iland. This said George, when he passed into the next countrie
adioining to the lake, in which the castell stood, did more liberallie than before (by corrupting
the k&eacute;epers with monie) consult with the qu&eacute;ene of all hir affaires.</p>
<p>Wherefore not onelie the Scots (whome the present state of things did mislike) being drawen
into that faction; but also the Frenchmen by Iames Hamilton (which had b&eacute;ene regent not
manie y&eacute;eres before) and Iames archbishop of Glascow sollicited therevnto, the Scots promised their bodilie force, and the French promised their helping purse. Now about the
end of Aprill, an ambassador came out of France requiring in the name of his king, that
he might haue leaue to go to the qu&eacute;ene: which if he were denied, he made shew that he
would presentlie depart. Wherevnto the gouernor answered, that it was not in his power to
grant it: that the qu&eacute;ene was not committed to prison by him, and that he could not determine anie thing herein without their knowledge which first restreined hir of libertie, and after by decr&eacute;e confirmed that deed: but he would not ceasse in pleasuring his sister, and such
a fr&eacute;end as the king (his maister) was, to doo all that he might: and further, that he would
take order for an assemblie of the nobilitie the twentith daie of the next moneth. Vntill
which time the ambassador s&eacute;emed somwhat appeased, and the regent applied the administration of the lawes.]</p>
<p>On sundaie the second of Maie, in the yeere 1568, at supper time, the qu&eacute;ene escaped out
<note place="marg"><date>1568.</date></note>

<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;enes escape out of Lochleuin.</note>
of Lochleuin, by the meanes and helpe of George Dowglas brother to the lard of Lochieuin.
The lard Seton, the lard of Ricarton, and Iames Hamilton of Oribiston, were readie to receiue hir, and conueied hir ouer the qu&eacute;enes ferrie, first to Nudrie the lard Seton his house,
and from thence to Hamilton castell, where she remained till the thirt&eacute;enth daie of Maie being
thursdaie, gathering in the meane time such forces as she might from all places. The earle
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene gathereth a power.</note>
of Murreie lord regent was in Glascow, at what time she thus escaped out of Lochleuin; and
vpon knowledge had therof, ment at the first to haue withdrawen himselfe to Sterling: but
suddenlie changing his purpose in that behalfe, he determined to continue at Glascow, which
<note place="marg">The regents determination to staie at Gloscow.</note>
is not past eight miles from Hamilton, because he was persuaded, that if she should shrinke
backe neuer so little, he should incourage his aduersaries, and discourage his friends, and
so consequentlie weaken his part greatlie. *Which they also supposed was the more 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 19.</note>
weakened, by the departure of Robert Boid (vnto the qu&eacute;enes part) hauing vntill that time woone
a great opinion of his constancie towards the regent.</p>
<p>This man, being of a famous familie, was now in the decaie of his house meanelie and
sparinglie brought vp vnder his father, a valiant gentleman, and one that followed the
frugalitie of the Scots, who (willing to prepare a waie to the readuance of his house, as
manie of his other kinred did) was now content to s&eacute;eke meanes therefore: for which
cause both he and his father did first follow the Hamiltons then ruling all things. But
after that their gouernement was posted ouer from them to the qu&eacute;ene mother the regent;
and that contention was mooued about religion: he ioined himselfe to the lords of the
congregation, from whome his father was most estranged: in which this Robert Boid firmelie continued vntill the qu&eacute;enes returne out of France. By meanes whereof, there was a
great opinion of his valure &amp; wisdome, on whose counsell Coline Campbell earle of Atholl
did almost wholie depend. But when by chance certeine of the nobilitie had coniured or
conspired (to vse Buchanans woord) for no euill act, but for the defense of the king, he subscribed to the same league.</p>
<p>But after, with like lightnesse both he and the earle of Argile (which hoong vpon his
aduise) wrote vnto the qu&eacute;ene cuerie thing that was doone in the same assemblie, from which
time this Boid was partaker of all the queenes secrets against his old friends, who with the
queene did yet obteine no greater opinion of constancie, than he did amongest others of

lightnesse and inconstancie. But after that the queene was imprisoned, and the earle of Murreie
made regent, he went then to the part of the gouernor: with whome he shewed such proofe of
his wit and industrie, that he was admitted into the priuie counsels of the regent, contrarie
to the opinion of others. But after when the matter should be tried by fight betw&eacute;ene the
regent &amp; the qu&eacute;ene (after hir escape from Lochleuin) he fled againe to the queene.] All
which notwithstanding, the thirt&eacute;enth daie of Maie afore mentioned, the qu&eacute;ene with hir power
marched from Hamilton, by the south side of Clede toward Dunbreton; and out of Glascow on the other part marched the lord regent with his forces: so as at length both the
armies met at a place called the Langside, n&eacute;ere to the house of Cathcart within two miles of
<note place="marg">The armies met at Langside.</note>

<p>There were on the qu&eacute;enes part the earles of Argile, Cassiles, Eglinton, and Rothes,

Lochinwar, Bas, Wauchton, Dalhousie, Roslen the shiriffe of Aire, sir Iames Hamilton, and
manie others. On the regents part were these accounted as principall, the earles of Morton,

Mar, Glencarne, Menteith, the maister of Graham, the lords Hume, Lindsie, Ruthwen,
Sempill, Ogiltree and Cathcart, of lairds and knights, Bargawy, Blacquhan, Drumlanrig, Sesford, Lus, Buchanan, Tulibardin, Peteur, Grange, Lochleuin, Lethington, and sir Iames Balfour. At the first ioining there was a verie sharpe incounter: for after they had bestowed
<note place="marg">They ioine in battell.</note>
their shot of harquebuzes and arrows, they fed to it with speares and swoords. But at
length, after three quarters of an houres fight, the qu&eacute;enes part was put to flight.</p>
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;enes part discomfited.</note>
<p>The victorie remained with the regent, who suffered none to be slaine but those that were

surname of the Hamiltons killed. There were taken prisoners about thr&eacute;e hundred, of
which number the principall were these: the lords Seton and Rosse, sir Iames Hamilton, and
manie other of that surname. Of the regents part, the lord Hume was hurt in the leg and
face, and the lord Ogiltree in the necke, by the lord Herries: the lord Lindseie, and the
lards of Drumlanrig, and of Grange, bare themselues verie valiantlie that day, failing not in
anie point that belonged to the dutie of hardie capteins. The qu&eacute;enes part was thought to be
n&eacute;ere at the point of six thousand men, and the regents was reckoned to be foure thousand: so that there were ten thousand men in the field that: daie, what vpon the one side
and the other.</p>
<p>The earle of Huntleie was comming forwards to haue assisted the queenes part, but the
<note place="marg">The earle of Huntleie comming forward to aid the qu&eacute;ene.</note>
battell was striken, and hir people discomfited (as ye haue heard) yer he could come, and so
he returned. In this battell the valiancie of an Hieland gentleman named Macferlane, stood
the regents part in great st&eacute;ed. For in the hottest brunt of the fight, he came in with two
Lundred of his friends and countriemen, and so manfullie gaue in vpon the flanke of the
qu&eacute;enes people, that he was a great cause of the disordering of them. This Macferlane had
b&eacute;ene latelie before (as I haue heard) condemned to die for some outrage by him committed: and obteining pardon (through sute of the countesse of Murreie) he recompensed
that clemencie by this p&eacute;ece of seruice now at this battell, [which was (as saith 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
Buchanan) fought the third daie of Maie, and the eleuenth after the qu&eacute;ene had escaped out of
prison.]</p>
<p>The qu&eacute;ene perceiuing the ouerthrow of hir people, fled from the place where she stood
to behold the battell, and withdrew to Crawford towne, and so by the Sauquhar to
Dundrenan in Gallowaie: and after she had taried there two or three daies, she tooke ship

<p>But now to the dooings in Scotland. The regent sent to summon Hamilton castell, but
the answer was respited till the next daie: and then he that had the charge came to Glascow, and offered the keies to the regent. The castell of Draffan was also y&eacute;elded at the
same time to the regent. The eight&eacute;enth of Maie, the regent made proclamation, that the
inhabitants of the shires of Merns, Angus, Fife, Mers, Louthian, Kile, and Carricke, should
prouide themselues of vittels for fifteene daies, and to m&eacute;et him at Beggar the tenth of Iune,

Cowhill, and Louchinwar, had b&eacute;ene at Dunfreis with a thousand men, and spent all the
vittels. It was thought that the lord Maxwell would haue come in, if the other had not
counselled him to the contrarie. The twentith of Iune they marched to Hoddom, a place
<note place="marg">Hoddom y&eacute;eldeth to the regent.</note>
belonging to the lord Herries: a thousand of the broken men were assembled and offered
skirmish; two or thr&eacute;e were taken, they laie within a mile of the regent that night.</p>
<p>The one and twentith the house was y&eacute;elded, and the custodie thereof committed to the
<note place="marg">The lard of Drumlanrig.</note>
lard of Drumlanrig that was appointed warden of those marches. It was thought verie
strong, so that the defendants might haue kept it longer if they had b&eacute;ene disposed. Great
hunger began to pinch the armie, a pint of wine was sold at seuen shillings Scotish, and no
bread to be had for anie monie. The regent sent foorth the earle of Morton, and the lord
Hume with a thousand men, to trie if they might haue drawen the broken men to a chase:
but it would not be, for they went their wales, and would not tarrie it. The two and twentith of Iune the campe laie still, but the regent with a thousand men went to Annand,
<note place="marg">Annand deliuered to the gouernor.</note>

<note place="marg">Lochmaben.</note>
and had it deliuered vnto him. H&eacute;ere he met with the lord Scroope, and afer returned
to the campe. The thr&eacute;e and twentith of Iune they went to Lochmaben and receiued the
castell, the which the regent deliuered to Drumlanrig: but some of the Maxwels being
closelie hid within an od corner of the house, after the regent was gone, brake out and
seized the house againe into their hands.</p>

<p>The same daie, two houses belonging to the lard of Iohnston, the one named Lochwood,
<note place="marg">Two houses of lard Iohnston taken by the regent.</note>
and the other Lowhousie, were taken, but not burnt: because the lard Iohnston had put in
suertie to come in by a day vnto the regent. The same daie they tooke great store of cattell,
and that night with a shot of the great artillerie, they slue two th&eacute;eues among thr&eacute;e score
others that came and approched verie n&eacute;ere to the armie, as the maner of the prickers is.
The armie laie that night at Milton holms. The foure and twentith of Iune they came to
P&eacute;eples, and the next day to Edenburgh, so ending that iournie; in the which they had
passed through the countries of Clidesdale, Gallowaie, Niddesdale, Annandale, &amp; Tw&eacute;edale.
Much a doo and great trouble arose within Scotland, by reason that the Hamiltons and their
<note place="marg">Great trouble in Scotland.</note>
adherents made parts against the regent, and those other lords that gouerned vnder the king;
whereof as I haue no certeine notes, so I must passe the same with silence.</p>
<p>*Whilest these things were thus in dooing, letters came to the regent from the queen
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 19.</note>
of England: for she was persuaded by such as were fled with the qu&eacute;ene of Scots into England, that there was great iniurie doone vnto the queene of Scots, being burdened with high
matters, through the enuie of hir euill subiects, in which chieflie the kinglie authoritie was
reuiled, and the regiment of sacred maiestie defaced. A thing which did not alone perteine
to the priuat person of the qu&eacute;ene of Scots, but to the example of all other princes. Which
euill of expelling kings, was sp&eacute;edilie and soundlie to be preuented, least it might cr&eacute;epe
anie further. By which and other persuasions, the queene of England required of the regent to send sufficient men, that should declare to hir the order of all things as they were
doone, and that should answer all such reproches as were laied against him.</p>
<p>Touching which matter, although it appeered grieuous and heauie in it selfe, to call
things in question which before were by parlement established; and to bring in vre a new
kind of iudgement of their causes before forren iudges and kings who were their enimies,
and first persuaded against the regent by such as maliced him and his faction; and that
after a sort the same s&eacute;emed dangerous and full of shame: yet on the other side there were
manie things that inforced him to accept that request of the queene of England, although
it were vniust. Wherefore when he had determined to send ambassadors, and that they
could not agr&eacute;e who they should be, sith the chiefest, and those of the nobilitie refused it:
at length the regent professed that he would take that iournie vpon him. For the performance whereof he chose certeine persons to accompanie him into England, contrarie to
the mind of William Metellan, which onelie denied and stood against it. Wherefore he
caried the said Metellan with him (fauoring the qu&eacute;ene) not doubting in the end by one
meanes or other to win him to his part.</p>
<p>The rest that went willinglie with him, were Iames Dowglas, Patrike Lindseie, being of
the nobilitie; the bishop of Orknie, &amp; the abbat of Fermlindon, churchmen; Iames Macgill, and Henrie Balnaue, lawiers of the college of iudges. To whome as the ninth was
ioined George Buchanan author of the Scotish historie: with whome the regent accompanied
to the number of 100 horsses, tooke his iournie into England, and came the fourth nones
of October to Yorke, to the assemblie appointed there by the qu&eacute;ene of England. On
which day, and almost at the same houre, Thomas Howard duke of Northfolke came thither
also; to which duke were associat in commission, to heare the controuersie of the Scots,
the earle of Sussex, and sir Rafe Sadler knight. After a few daies, came thither such as
were sent by the queene of Scots, which did complaine of hir vnkind subiects, and required
helpe to restore hir to hir kingdome. These men being heard (sundered from the regent
and the earls) did (after they had protested that they came not vnto them as iudges, hauing
anie right to make lawes to bind them) with manie words open the iniuries which the
Scotish subiects had doone vnto their qu&eacute;ene, and required of the qu&eacute;ene of England, that
either she would persuade hir vnkind people to receiue their prince againe; or if they refused the same, that she would giue them an armie, with which they might compell them
therevnto.</p>
<p>In few hours after this, the regent (calling the matter to the deciding of law, before equall

<!--<fw place="bot-center">"4 M 2"</fw>--><!--<fw place="bot-right">"arbitrators)"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"636"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

arbitrators) did contend (sith nothing was doone but by right, by law, by the ancient custome of their countrie, by the determination of the assemblie of parlement, and by the subscription of manie such as were there present to accuse them) that he alone by his authoritie
could not vndoo the same: but when the English commissioners had denied that they could
be satisfied with those things doone at home, &amp; here pronounced by the Scots, except some
cause were shewed that inforced them so seuerelie to pronounce against their queene; the
regent answered that he did chieflie flee that matter, least he should be driuen to accuse his
qu&eacute;ene and sister. Which he denied to doo, not willing to laie abroad to forren nations
hir wicked deeds, as Buchanan tearmeth them. To the contrarie whereof he would not be
inforced, vnlesse the qu&eacute;ene of England would promise to defend the cause of the now king,
and to take him into hir protection: if he did manifestlie prooue, that the qu&eacute;ene of
Scots had murthered the king of Scots hir husband. Wherevnto the English answered,
that they had authoritie onelie to heare both parts, and to declare their whole request vnto
their queene.</p>
<p>By reason whereof, in the end they wrote to the queene of England all the state of their
dooings; who did write backe, that the earle of Murreie should send one or more to the
English court, fullie to informe hir thereof, sith she would doo all therein that belonged
vnto hir. Which letters receiued, the earle of Murreie sent Metallan (a man before suspected, and that did after ioine in conference with Iohn Lesle bishop of Rosse) to the court
of England, associated with Iames Macgill. Now after these men were come to the qu&eacute;ene
at London, it was thought most conuenient by hir and hir councell, that the regent himselfe
should be present, when all matters of controuersie were intreated vpon. For which cause,
sending part of his companie backe into Scotland, the regent came with a small traine to
London: where the same difficultie was obiected against him which was doone at Yorke:
to which he answered as before. Whilst these things were dooing at London, the queene
of Scots did by Iames Balfure moue warres in Scotland. For the furtherance whereof, she
wrote letters to hirs and Bothwels friends, and made manie deputies to execute hir authoritie
in Scotland.</p>
<p>When the regent saw himselfe thus beset on euerie side, he determined to returne with
all sp&eacute;ed into Scotland aswell as he might, without dispatch of that for which he came.
Wherefore the English still instantlie vrging him to tell the cause (which being vntold, they
could not determine anie thing therein) that mooued them to doo those things in Scotland:
the regent (loth to offend the qu&eacute;ene of England) made a long protestation how vnwilling
he was to accuse the qu&eacute;ene, and his sister; and therefore requested one thing, that they
which were the occasion to lead him into this battell might be present thereat, for because
he would vse their witnes in the weightiest matters. Which for manie great reasons being
denied by the English, the queene of England required, that the qu&eacute;ene of Scots (by force
and armes expelled) might be restored home; &amp; therewithall giuing the regent a day, to
shew cause whie the reuengers of the kings death had taken armes against the queene;
although the erle of Murreie were none of them: for he was in France at the time of the
d&eacute;ed doone. Wherefore the regent shewing all he could against the queene of Scots for the
defense of hir aduersaries; in the end, the qu&eacute;ene of England deferring the same to another day, permitted the regent to depart home to appease the troubles there, and that he
should leaue some one of his behind him, to answere all such euils as should be obiected
against him.</p>
<p>But the regent desired them whilest he was there, that his accusors might be brought out.
Wherevpon the accusors being present, and saieng that they had not then anie thing to saie;
but that they would further shew their accusation where it pleased the queene: the matter
with much controuersie ended on both parts, &amp; the councell brake vp without anie finall
sentence therin. But whilest the regent remained thus in England (as is a little before
touched) there were manie things without successe attempted by the queene of Scots followers. For Iames Hamilton (who a little before had b&eacute;ene gouernor) being grieued with

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"the"</fw>-->

<pb n="637"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"637"</fw>-->

the mishap of things at home, falling out contrarie vnto his mind, did therefore depart into
France, where (remoued from all companie, and onelie attended vpon with a man or two)
he did secretlie liue to himselfe.</p>
<p>But when the qu&eacute;ene of Scots was escaped the prison of Lochleuin, and that she was after
subdued in battell, being within a few daies after compelled to land in England; the Frenchmen that could not draw the earle of Murreie (now by his friends called home into his
countrie) into their faction, thought it best for manie reasons (sith they might not for the
troubles in France send him succor or monie) to raise vp the said Hamilton against the earle
of Murreie, and especiallie at that time whilest the regent was in England. Wherefore he
comming out of his den abrode into the world, inriched by the French with a few golden
crownes, and ouercharged with manie faire promises, was importuned by his friends and
kinred, whilest he hastened from England into Scotland, that the qu&eacute;ene of England with
the authoritie of the qu&eacute;ene of Scots, would induce the earle of Murreie to deliuer vp his
regentship of Scotland vnto him; sith that place was of right due vnto him (by the maners
and lawes of all nations, but chiefelie by the custome of his countrie) as n&eacute;erest in bloud,
and next in succession.</p>
<p>For the proofe whereof, it is not necessarie to reckon vp the memorie of histories from
the first times, considering it is knowne to all men, that gouernors haue b&eacute;ene giuen to
those of yoong yeares (not able to rule the kingdome) of such as haue beene n&eacute;erest of
bloud. For so, after the death of Iames the third, Robert his vncle had the gouernement
in the absence of Iames the first; and Murdac the son of the same Robert succ&eacute;eded him
therein. And of late time in our remembrance, Iohn duke of Albanie did gouerne the
yoong yeares of Iames the fift; and Hamilton himselfe, in the minoritie of Marie the queene
that now is, being as then neither fit for a husband or a kingdome, did a few yeares rule
all the affaires of Scotland. Who now by certeine rebels, was through vnlawfull voices excluded thereof with force and violence, and that (which is woorse) a bastard is aduanced
therevnto in contempt of lawfull bloud. Which honor, if it were restored vnto him, he
would shortlie appease all those ciuill bralles, and restore the queene of Scots vnto hir kingdome, without anie force or tumult of armes.</p>
<p>Wherevnto the king of Scots legats did answer, that Hamilton did not onelie demand
a thing quite contrarie to the lawes and old customs of Scotland; but also a thing most
vniust, if no authoritie of law were against it. For our ancestors (by reason of many
murthers committed by those of the kings bloud) almost a thousand thr&eacute;e hundred yeares
past, did change the order in creating of their kings. For whereas before, they which were
of the familie of Fergusius, the first king of that name, were in the life of the king chosen
after to reigne, not as n&eacute;erest of bloud; but as persons most woorthie to weild a kingdome:
Kenneth the third (to the end to take awaie from the court all treacherie towards the kings
familie, and cruell murthers of kinreds amongest themselues) did establish that order which
is now obserued in creating of our kings; which was, that the next in bloud should be
aduanced to the place of the deceassed king.</p>
<p>But afterwards, when men were taught by the successe of things, that it could scarse be
chosen; but that in such inconstancie of fortune, the right of the chiefest magistrat must
sometime light vpon children and vpon heires also vnfit for gouernement, they did ordeine,
that he should be chosen to the administration of the publike wealth; which did excell
others in wealth and wisedome. Which course our ancestors haue kept almost these six
hundred yeares, leauing the kingdome whole &amp; sound to posteritie. According to the
which, when Robert Bruse was dead, there were gouernors chosen by voices: which were
Thomas Randolph earle of Murreie, Donald earle of Mar Andrew Murreie, Iohn Randolph,
&amp; Robert Steward. For sometime, as manie were chosen gouernors togither; so when
Iames the second was a child, Alexander Leuingston, being no kin to the king, no not so
much as of the nobilitie, but onelie a knight, was appointed gouernor to the yoong king.</p>
<p>Which may not be excused, in saieng that the same was then so doone, because there

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"wanted"</fw>-->

<pb n="538"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"538"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

wanted men of the kings bloud to supplie those places. For at that time were liuing Iohn
Kennedie head of the familie, the kings kinsman by the sister of Iames the first; and the
vncle by his fathers side: Iames Kennedie also, bishop of saint Andrews, a man of most account in the kingdome for all kinds of vertue, being borne of the kings aunt: and Dowglas
also, earle of Angus, with Archembald earle of Dowglas, both of the kings bloud; whereof
the last was in riches and power almost equall to the king, but far beyond the wealth and
power of all others; of whome, none did euer complaine to the parlement, when they were
put besides the gouernement, and others not so neere of bloud appointed therevnto. Not
long after, foure tutors were appointed to Iames the third, which were not made in respect
of bloud; but chosen by the voices of the nobilitie.</p>
<p>And although of late, Iohn duke of Albanie was by the nobilitie called out of France to
the gouernment of Scotland, during the tender y&eacute;eres of Iames the fift, and confirmed in
the same by publike decr&eacute;e of parlement; yet was it not giuen vnto him in respect of n&eacute;erenesse of bloud. For he had Alexander his elder brother in life, who although perhaps he was
inferior to the duke; yet he was farre aboue Iames Hamilton (in all kind of vertue) which
did sometimes reach after that place. But in the absence of Iames the first, Robert his vncle
ruled the kingdome. But by what right? Was he admitted therevnto for neerenesse of
bloud? No trulie.</p>
<p>What then? Was he chosen of the people? No. How then was he made? Marie when
king Robert the third was not sufficient to rule the kingdome, either for strength of bodie
or mind, he did substitute Robert his brother as his deputie, &amp; commended his children to
his gouernment; who in the end famished Dauid the eldest, and also threatened death vnto
the yoonger sonne Iames, which he did auoid by fleeing Scotland. Which Robert being
in the possession of authoritie by tyrannie (and his brother killed with thought) did leaue
the same to Murdac his sonne. So that it cannot be doubted what the mind of the last king
Robert was to his brother, for he would neuer (if he had liued and b&eacute;ene in health) haue
made him tutor of his children, whom at the houre of his death he curssed as the butcher
of his children.</p>
<p>That time also, in which this Hamilton gouerned, dooth remember vnto vs manie things
(though what soeuer was then doone, is no proofe that it was well doone) which are to be
considered of. For when the cardinall Beton did labor by subtiltie to inuade the chiefe gouernement, this Hamilton rather leaning to the hatred which good men did beare towards
Beton, than trusting to the fauor of the people towards himselfe, did leape into the emptie
place of a gouernor; in which he ruled with much crueltie and couetousnesse, and in few
yeeres after, both sold the gouernement (obteined by force) and the qu&eacute;ene, whom he had
vnder his authoritie. At what time was shewed the fauor which the people bare vnto him,
when they preferred the gouernement of a strange woman, before the bondage which they
had vnder him.</p>
<p>You s&eacute;e now (I hope) the request of the Hamiltons to be against our countrie lawes,
and decrees of our ancestors, and that so contrarie vnto them, that wanting other sufficient
arguments, he is constreined to confirme the same onelie with lies. But if there were anie
such custome, I suppose there is none but dooth see how uniust it were. For what can be
more vnrightfull, than to commit yoong, weake, and faultlesse yeeres to his faith, which
dooth dailie either looke or wish for the death of the pupill? Whose whole familie hath alwaies b&eacute;ene at dailie and deadlie warre with the house of the king that now is? What defense can be here by neerenesse of bloud against old malice, vnmeasurable couetousnesse,
and the headie violence of (alreadie tasted) tyrannie? Laodice the queene of Cappadocia is
supposed to haue killed hir owne children, as they came to y&eacute;ers of discretion, and to haue
bought the small continuance of hir gouernement with the bloud of hir sonnes.</p>
<p>Wherfore, if the mother spared not hir owne flesh, for the gaine of short authoritie; what
will old enimies doo, inflamed to crueltie with the brands of couetousnesse (nay rather what
is to be thought that they will not doo) against a child, which deferreth effect of their hope

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"639"</fw>-->

of gouernement? If this example s&eacute;eme ouer old or obscure to anie man, or to be ouer farre
set, I will lay downe some n&eacute;erer home, and those most notable. Who is so ignorant of
this latelie doone, that he knoweth not that Galeas Sfortia (growne to descretion, a husband,
and sonne in law to a most mightie king) was slaine by his vncle Lodowike? Or to whom
are the calamities vnknowne, which followed so cruell a parricide and kin-slaier? For the
most beautifull countrie of Italie was almost brought thereby to vtter destruction: the familie
of the Sforties, the mother of manie a valiant person cleane destroied, and the barbarous
people (from whose crueltie and couetousnesse nothing was safe) brought into the pleasant
places about Padus. Who is he that is borne in Britaine, that hath not heard of the crueltie of Richard (the third king of that name in England) against the children of his brother?
But with what bloudshed was that in the end purged?</p>
<p>Now, sith these did not feare to doo such euils to their neerest bloud, by the onelie inforcing desire to gouerne, being otherwise woorthie persons: what shall we looke for from
him, whose inconstancie of mind all the Scots doo know? Whose vnskilfull gouernement
they haue tried with manie slaughters? And (which is more) whose familie not content
with the murther of this kings great grandfather, did go about to intrap his grandfather by
the mothers side, whilest he was in life; and when he could not kill the grandfather by the
fathers side, he thrust the poore father out of the kingdome, brought forth the mother to be
slaine as a sacrifice, &amp; sold hir kingdome (when they could not inioy it) to strangers: out of
which bondage she (by the prouidence of God) being deliuered, they haue throwne themselues into these troubles in which they now are. Whereby we may easilie vnderstand, what
the iudgement of the common people was touching that matter, in that those men doo now
s&eacute;eme to be deliuered out of a prison of miserable bondage, and to behold the sw&eacute;et light
of libertie, when they (which knew not how to order it) did sell their gouernment to a strange
woman.</p>
<p>These things being thus heard on both sides before the councell of England, the qu&eacute;ene
thereof by hir said councell declared to Hamilton, that he required an vniust thing, and that
he should not hope for anie aid from hir; and that she hath promised the kings ambassador,
that Hamilton should not depart England, before that the said ambassador had leaue likewise to go home. After that these things were doone, and that the regent somewhat indifferentlie dispatched his affairs in England, he obteined leaue to depart, and was honorablie conducted
home with the English, who sufficientlie garded him: but especiallie the nobilitie and companie
of the north parts, sith it was great honor for hir maiestie safelie to returne him home, who
(vpon hir letters had) was come out of his owne countrie. Which regent comming to Edenburgh the next day after the kalends of Februarie, h&eacute;e was there receiued with great pompe.</p>
<p>Few daies after this, those of the kings faction assembled at Striueling, where the regent
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan lib.</emph> 19.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan lib.</emph> 19.</note>
declared vnto them what he had doone in England; which being well liked, was in the end
confirmed by all the nobilitie. Much about that time, Iames Hamilton chiefe of that familie came out of England, being by the qu&eacute;ene of Scots authorised with a new and arrogant
letter: in that she called him hir father, and made him hir vicar and deputie of the kingdome. This man at his first comming made proclamation, that no man should obeie anie
other than such as were substituted by him. Wherevpon those of the kings part (bestowing
summes of monie vpon souldiers, to make them readie, if n&eacute;ed required, to the vttermost
conflict) met on a day appointed at Glascow.</p>
<p>But when there was a great assemblie of the common people at Hamilton, more than
they looked for, a meanes of agr&eacute;ement was attempted, with this condition: that Hamilton,
comming to Glascow, should acknowledge the king for chiefest gouernor: which if he did,
all other things should easilie be agreed; but if he denied that, he shuld come in vaine: all
which he promised to doo, and the kings armie was dismissed. When he came to Glascow,
they obteined their former goods and honors the same day, in which he and his friends professed themselues subiects to the king: but yet so, that in the meane time they should 

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"maine"</fw>-->

remaine in prison, or else giue pledges of their next kin; with further notice, that if anie of
the said part would so doo, they should also be receiued on the same couen&aacute;nts, wherevnto
the earle of Argile and the earle Huntleie refused to subscribe.</p>
<p>Hamilton comming at the day appointed to Edenburgh, did deferre the performance of
his promises, deuising manie delaies; vntill the other principall of the factions were come,
whereby the couenants might be established by all their consents, for which he praied day till
the tenth of Maie: and that in the meane time he might vnderstand the mind of the imprisoned qu&eacute;ene of Scots: all which in the end was denied vnto him. Wherevpon Hamilton (confessing the truth) said, that he consented to those conditions by compulsion; and
that (if he were fr&eacute;e) h&eacute;e would not allow of anie of them. For which answer, Hamilton
&amp; Maxwell were committed prisoners to the castell of Edenburgh. The earle of Argile
was suffered to be quiet at home, but the earle Huntleie was more hardie dealt withall, bicause that in the absence of the gouernor he had taken manie, and had made deputies about
Crawford and Ogiluie.</p>
<p>Wherevpon there was day giuen vnto them both to meet at the assemblie at saint Andrews, whither the earle of Argile first came: with whom there was no extreme dealing,
bicause he ceased to trouble the realme anie more, was of kinred to the gouernor, and
they two were of great friendship togither euen from their yoong y&eacute;ers. But when the cause
of Huntleie (long before his comming) was well debated, the gouernor pronounced, that he
would pardon all priuate faults doone to him, or to the king: but that hee neither could
nor would pardon anie iniuries doone to any other. And if Huntleie, or his friends that
folowed his faction, could passe away with those spoils, he would willinglie labor that arbitrators chosen by both parts, should temper the value of the damage. At what time also
there grew a further mischiefe, whether all they which tooke part with Huntleie shuld also be
pardoned; but in the end, vpon deliberation, all things s&eacute;emed indifferentlie well pacified.</p>
<p>During these things, the queene of England sent letters into Scotland in the behalfe of the
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchanan. lib.</emph> 19.</note>
imprisoned queene; either that she might wholie be restored, or iointlie rule with hir sonne;
or admitted to liue priuatlie in hir owne countrie. All which being denied to be granted,
the Scots sent Robert Petcarne, a man of great wisedome and fidelitie, to deliuer their answer
vnto the qu&eacute;ene of England. Whilest these things were in dooing, the gouernor fearing
the power of the imprisoned qu&eacute;ene, which now waxed great, did call William Mettellan
before him, from Perth to Striueling; who requested the earle of Argile to go with him for
his better suertie. Afterwards, this William sitting in the councell, was accused by Thomas
Crawford of the kings death, wherevpon he was commanded prisoner to a chamber in the
castell, and others were sent to apprehend Iames Balfurie.</p>
<p>But in the end, the gouernors mildnesse suffered no great hurt to fall vpon them; for Balfurie by his friends soone obteined pardon; and Mettellan being led to Edenburgh, was left
in a house there not farre from the castell: to whome certeine horssemen were appointed
k&eacute;epers, vnder the charge of Alexander Hume a noble yoong man, appointed chiefe ouer
them. But William Kircadie, capteine of the castell of Edenburgh, about ten of the clocke
at night, did counterfeit letters signed with the hand of the earle of Murreie, and brought
them to Alexander, willing him to deliuer William Mettellan, which he did accordinglie.
Wherevpon Mettellan was caried by Kircadie into the castell, to the great mislike of the nobilitie, being almost vncerteine whether they should impute the d&eacute;ed to Kircandie, or to the
gouernor, not being vnacquainted with the boldnesse of Kircadie: in such sort, that the same

the earle of Warwike, and the lord admerall Clinton, the said two earles were kept so in
feare, that they durst not aduance farre forward in their wicked begun enterprise, but were
constreined to retire backe towards Durham. Whervpon the earle of Sussex, supposing
that their meaning was for their last refuge and safegard to take the castels of Alnewike and
Warkeworth, he wrote vnto sir Iohn Forster lord warden of the middle marches, either by
force, policie, or some other means, to get into his hands the possession of those two castes,
and the same to fortifie with such number and garisons of men, as to his discretion should
be thought conuenient, for the safe custodie and gard thereof.</p>
<p>Sir Iohn Forster, being at his house neere to Alnewike, when he receiued these letters,
accompanied with his seruants, friends, and tenants, &amp; some souldiers that were come to
him from Berwike, marched vp to the castell on foot, where finding the house garded with
a great number of the earle of Northumberlands seruants, reteiners, and tenants, be made
proclamation before the castell gate, that eucrie of them within the castell should come foorth,
<note place="marg">Proclamation made at Alnewike by sir Io. Forster.</note>
and withdraw to their owne houses, vpon paine to be reputed rebels to the qu&eacute;enes maiestie: and that which of them soeuer did refuse to obeie this proclamation, staieng either in
the castell or elsewhere in anie vnlawfull assemblie, it should be lawfull for euerie man to
spoile his goods, and him to kill if he made resistance.</p>
<p>This proclamation notwithstanding, they within the castell, at the first refused to y&eacute;eld it
vp. And therevpon sir Iohn Forster marched through the towne into the market place, and
there made the like proclamation in behalfe of all the inhabitants that were the earle of Northumberlands tenants, for their repairing home to their houses. And comming herewith
<note place="marg">The castell of Alnewike and Warkeworth fortified by sir Io. Forster.</note>
backe towards the castell, they within perceiuing themselues destitute of succor, and sir
Iohn Forster to increase in power, did vpon better aduise yeeld themselues vnto him, who
saued all their liues. After the same maner he got also the castell of Warkewoorth, and
fortified them both with sufficient number of men. This doone, he assembled such forces
as he was able to make, so that he got togither to the number of eleuen hundred horssemen,
and tooke order to forlaie and stop the passages, so as the earles friends and tenants in Northumberland should not go vnto him.</p>
<p>After this, hauing in his companie the lord Ogle, and Thomas Forster his brother, and
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn Forster k&eacute;epeth Newcastell against the rebels.</note>

<note place="marg">Sir Henrie Persie against his brother the earle of Northumberland.</note>
other gentlemen, he went to Newcastell, where with Thomas Gower esquire, that had
the principall rule therof at that time, he tooke order for the defense of that towne against
the rebels. Hither came to him sir Henrie Persie, offering his seruice against his brother,
and other the rebels, to the vttermost of his power. Herevpon diuerse excursions were
made foorth of Newcastell into the bishoprike, where the two earles were incamped, and
sundrie skirmishes chanced betwixt the two parties, though no great hurt followed thereof. The erles yet on a day came from Durham, and with their armie marched towards
Newcastell. Sir Iohn Forster, and sir Henrie Persie, hauing intelligence thereof, issued
foorth of Newcastell with all their forces, and certeine p&eacute;eces of great ordinance. They had
also with them certeine bands of the souldiers of Berwike, meaning verelie to haue ioined
battell with the earles: sir Henrie Persie shewing himselfe as willing and forward thereto as
anie other in all the companies.</p>
<p>At Chester deane, midwaie betwixt Durham and Newcastell, the armies approched the
<note place="marg">Chester dean.</note>
one n&eacute;ere to the other, a small brooke running in a hollow diuiding them asunder, so that
there was no passage for them to conueie their ordinance ouer, the bankes on either side
being so st&eacute;epe and cumbersome. Wherevpon the eries, perceiuing that they were disappointed of their purpose, after some skirmishes betwixt the horssemen, they returned vnto
Durham: and from thence the next day they went to Hexham, and after being in vtter
despaire, fled into Scotland: where the erle of Westmerland lighted among those that

shifted him awaie so from place to place, that he escaped out of that realme, when
he could no longer remaine there in suertie. But the earle of Northumberland fell into
their hands, which deliuered him vnto the regent, who thought he could doo no lesse than

put him in safe k&eacute;eping, considering the amitie that was betwixt the two princes, the queenes
maiestie of England, and the king of Scots.</p>
<p>But shortlie after, the regent (as he was riding through Lithquo) was wickedlie shot in

<note place="marg">The earle of Murreie lord regent slaine.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
with an harquebuse, by one Iames Hamilton, and so wounded, that the next day he
died of the hurt [as saith Buchanan out of a wood gallerie, in which were clothes hanged as
it were to an other vse.] *But the night before the slaughter of the regent, Walter Scot,
and Thomas Kar also of Fernihirst entered into England to spoile the borders, which they
did more cruellie than euer was doone before, rather for desire of reuenge of some iniurie,
than for the gaine of anie booties. Besides which, the capteine of the castell where Mettellan
was prisoner, was now commanded to set the same Mettellan at libertie: who upon oth before the nobilitie (which allowed and confirmed the same) did purge himselfe of the death
of the king, and of the ciuill warres mooued in England (wherewith he was charged) adding
<note place="marg"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 20.</note>
that he would proue the same at anie time when day should be appointed to him therefore.
After which, there was an assemblie made for the election of a new gouernour.</p>
<p>At what time Thomas Randolph, being sent thither ambassador for the queene of England
in the life of the regent, had audience granted vnto him; whose message was to demand,
the deliuerie of such rebels of England as had fled thither: which ambassador the deceassed
gouernour had before refused to heare at Striueling. Wherevpon, sith all things were then
in a turmoile by his death, they departed. But now, when there was a parlement for the
choosing of a new regent, Randolph which had b&eacute;ene in Scotland some y&eacute;eres before, because
he seemed best to know the men and their conditions of Scotland, and bicause he had before dispatched some other ambassages for the benefit of the realme, was held d&eacute;ere and
well est&eacute;emed of the nobilitie, and therfore was brought into the councell.</p>
<p>Who, after that he had declared what the mind of his prince had b&eacute;ene vnto the Scots, he
shewed that she would not now abbate the same vnto them in these troublesome times, no
more than she had defore doone. After which he remembred the inuasions made into
England, with the slaughters, spoiles, and burnings committed a little before: all which he
well knew was not doone by the counsell or labor of the publike state: and therefore his
queenes fauor was not diminished to them, but that the same good will did remaine to them
now, as ample as euer it was. And where she was grieuouslie offended (and that without
hir desert) yet she was not now determined (although by right she iustlie might) to demand
publike restitution and recompense for such euils: nor to exact punishment of the whole
nation for the misdooing of a few.</p>
<p>For she was not ignorant what tumults and troubles of all things was of late raised amongest
them. Notwithstanding this euill, she did not yet anie whit doubt of the fauor of the good
and vertuous men vnto hir: and that she would not onlie for their cause separate the offense from the publike consent: but also (if they themselues for the domesticall seditions
could not inforce the disturbers of the quiet to make restitution of such spoiles) that she
would ioine hir power with them, to the end by common counsell they might take iust punishment vpon the truce-breakers. Which if they could not then doo by that meanes, that
yet she would prosecute those iniuries with hir owne people, whose armie should without
anie damage to them passe through such places as would be quiet, and take no reuenge
vpon anie that were not guiltie of that iniurie. The rest of the parts of his ambassage did
conteine admonitions alwaies profitable in all lawfull assemblies, but most necessarie for the
present state of Scotland.</p>
<p>Whereof the first aduise was for the defense of religion, with an especiall care of diligence
therein: sith the same alone dooth teach vs the forme of our dutie, and peace towards
God, our prince, our equall &amp; christian neighbors. For no common-wealth diuided in it selfe
can long continue: for which cause they must chieflie labor with all their power, with might
and maine, with saile and ores, that peace and quiet maie be holilie and vertuouslie nourished at
home amongest their people. For sith God the creator of all things, hath imparted a kinglie

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"643"</fw>-->

gouernement ouer this nation, it is iust and m&eacute;et that they obeie their princes; and in dutifull sort bestow all honor, reuerence, and obedience vpon them; sith peace, concord, amitie, and loue, with all men (as much as in vs lieth to vse) is most acceptable to God, and
dooth take awaie (or at the least hinder) the thirst and shedding of mens bloud, a fault which
God of all others dooth most hate.</p>
<p>Which vnitie increasing the wealth of euerie one, maketh all nations more fearefull to their
enimies, and is the preseruer of iustice: whose chiefe part consisting in punishing the euill,
is especiallie to be imbraced: when contrarilie dissention and treason is a thing most ditestable to all lawfull gouernement: sith such kind of people are to be pursued with all extremitie, and not be succored with anie fauor, with anie mercie, or with anie pardon, into
what countrie soeuer they fl&eacute;e for refuge of their hated wickednesse. All these things did
Randolph both godlie and wiselie admonish vs of, and iustlie and modestlie require from vs.</p>
<p>But because there was no regent chosen for the supreme gouernement, there could no
certeine answer be giuen therevnto: for which cause he was for that time put backe to the
kalends of Maie. At last, William and Iames Dowglasse, brothers of the slaine regent by
one mother, were heard in this parlement, who required that the vnwoorthie death of their
brother might be reuenged, sith the same was taken awaie not for anie priuat grudge, but
for the common-wealths cause. Vpon the opening whereof men were of diuerse opinions
about his death, though they all agreed that the offendors should be punished: for some
would haue a day giuen to such as were suspected of the murther: for the names of manie
persons were there shewed to answer the same. But it better pleased other not to wait for
anie appointed day of law to be giuen to them, who had alreadie taken armes with violence
to defend that d&eacute;ed which they had alreadie doone; and that they should not onelie raise
their weapons against them, but also against all such as were condemned in that assemblie
of the nobilitie.</p>
<p>To which opinion all the knights and souldiors did soone agree, who yet could not hold
their determination, especiallie sith the earle of Atholl and Morton did dissuade them from
it: whereof the first would haue them tarrie, vntill there were a greater assemblie of the nobilitie: and the other supposed that it would come to passe, that if they ioined manie faults
in one, that the reuenge of the regent would perish and come to nothing, and the matter
would burst out to ciuill wars, wherby al they that feared peace, would flee to the part
of such as were guiltie of the murther. Wherefore their faults were to be diuided, and (if
it were possible) to treat of them by law, and that nothing should be doone or changed
vntill the kalends of Maie, on which there was an assemblie or parlement appointed.</p>
<p>Vpon which persuasion the companie was dissolued, though the greatest part of the nobilitie did condemne this delaie, as mooued thervnto: because that the other would saie that
all things were doone at the becke of the kings enimies, who had thus protracted the time,
to the end that the malice of the death of this regent might by little and little vanish in the
meane time, and the aduerse faction gather greater power togither. Which opinion of the
common people was confirmed by manie things that went before, and manie things which followed. For presentlie (before the death of the regent was fullie spread abroad) Iames Hamilton) morgaging his lands to Iohn Summeruill of Caninethame) borowed monie thereof:
with which, and with other monie taken vp of the rest of his friends, he sent to his fauorers
(to hire souldiors) being warned before, that they should alwaies be readie at all times, and
for all causes which should happen by the taking awaie of their deadlie enimie, the earle
of Murreie: neither after that time did the queenes faction ceasse from m&eacute;eting in diuerse
distant places.</p>
<p>On the fift&eacute;enth kalends of March, there did assemble the chiefe of the rebellious raction
(for by that name and epitheton dooth Buchanan alwaies terme those that tooke the qu&eacute;enes
part) to deuise of their affaires. At what time the earle of Argile, and the lord Boid did
write vnto earle Morton, that they would willinglie (sith they did not yet know who killed
the regent, and who were consenting therevnto) consult with the other nobilitie about the

<!--<fw place="bot-center">"4 N 2"</fw>--><!--<fw place="bot-right">"same"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"644"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

same matter, both to search out and to punish the same: and that they would not come to
Edenburgh about that matter. But if the kings faction would be so persuaded, they would
willinglie come to Lithquo, to Faukirke, or to Striueling, there to m&eacute;et with them. Wherevpon, the earle of Morton, consulting with Metellan about the same (for so it was desired
in the letters) in the end it came to no effect. At the same time, Thomas Kar wrote to
Limuch (to vse Buchanans woord) to the gardian of the castell, to see if he could obteine
of the qu&eacute;ene of England to staie hir armie: which if he brought to passe, that then he
would take such order, that be would easilie pacifie the borders without anie further trouble,
and that they should remaine in that dutie which they were woont: but if she did refuse
this condition, he would continue in his attempt, not doubting but the good subiects
would shew their obedience towards their imprisoned qu&eacute;ene, &amp; would ioine themselues
togither, because aid would shortlie come out of France vnto them.</p>
<p>On the fift nones of March, the Hamiltons, the earle of Argile, and Boid came to Lithquo; but the murther of one hired souldior did trouble all their deuise by a sudden tumult
that was raised therevpon. Wherefore the next day after the archbishop of saint Andrewes
did bring the Hamiltons home, the rest of the qu&eacute;enes faction, especiallie the earles of Huntleie, Atholl, Crawford, and the lords Ogiluie, Hume, Seton, and Metellan, met at Edenburgh: in which the earle Morton was accompanied with a small traine, vntill the earles of
Glencarne and Mar were come with their retinue. The fourth nones of March the chiefe
of the factions met togither to consult of the estate of things: but the same did proc&eacute;ed verie
slowlie, by reason of the absence of the earle of Argile, whose power and authoritie was then
verie great.</p>
<p>This man did Huntleie s&eacute;eke to persuade to ioine with the rest of the faction, but he returned without dooing anie thing (as it was supposed by most men) through the subtiltie of
Metellan, which would haue things long deferred, that more conuenient meane might be
had in that troublesome state of the kingdome, for the innouation of things. The greatest
thing doone in this assembling, was the argument for the choise of a new gouernor, which
(as it s&eacute;emeth) came to no effect. Now when all these assemblies tended to little purpose,
those of the qu&eacute;enes faction returned to sowe sedition by procuring English warres, thereby
to draw the common-people to assist their part. Wherefore they send the capteine (that
before had doone the like) afresh at this time to execute the same, who left nothing vndoone
that might tend to extreme crueltie.</p>
<p>During which, the heads of the faction doo reproch the qu&eacute;ene of England, and slander
the nobilitie of Scotland, as though they were the clients and followers of the English;
further threatning abroad in euerie place, that they would vse the aid of the French and
Spanish, if the lord of the congregation praied in aid of the English. Much about that time,
(as it were by chance) landed (out of France) at Dunbreton, Veriacke, one of the chamber
to the French king, which aduanced the mindes of the qu&eacute;enes faction, with manie large
promises: by meanes whereof the Hamiltons appointed an assemblie of their people at Lithquo the first ides of Aprill.</p>
<p>At which day, when a great assemblie was made of the qu&eacute;enes faction, they began there
openlie to treat of those things which before were whispered in secret: which was, that the
death of the king and regent might be either forgotten, or at least wax cold in the publike
turmoile of the realme, by making warre vpon the English. After which consultation,
they determined to go to Edenburgh the third ides of Aprill, there (besides manie other
commodities which might grow to them by that place) to ioine vnto them the citizens, by
whom there was great helpe of good successe to be receiued. Which they thought they
might easille bring about, by reason that William Kircadie was gouernor both of the castell
and towne, against which deuise the citizens did yet contend. But in the end, with hard
conditions, the qu&eacute;enes part was admitted into the towne. After which, not thus contented,
they persuadeo the citizens to deliuer vp the keies of their towne, which they most wiselie
refused.</p>

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"All"</fw>-->

<pb n="645"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"645"</fw>-->

<p>All this while there was a great resort to Metellan then lieng of the gowt, for which
cause his house was commonlie called the schoolehouse, and himselfe the schoolemaister.
In which meane time, the earle of Atholl did not spare to trauell hither and thither, to draw
those of the other faction to that assemblie at Edenburgh. But they would not come thither at all, vntill the kalends of Maie (which was a day appointed for the parlement) vnlesse they knew some iust necessitie which might preuent that day: and then if there happened anie thing of moment, which might not suffer anie delaie, they would communicate
the same to the earle Morton, whose house was but foure mile from thence, &amp; he should
giue other knowledge thereof. In the end, a day was appointed by the earle of Atholl, in
which a few of both factions should m&eacute;et at the towne of the earle Morton, called Dalketh,
which place did not like the qu&eacute;enes faction, whose strength was much holpen by such
prisoners as Kircadie had set at libertie out of the castell of Edenburgh.</p>
<p>But all the deuises and helps of the qu&eacute;ens faction were quailed, by the rumor of the
English armie comming to Berwike. Wherevpon, Alexander Hume, and Iohn Maxwell
latelie deliuered out of prison, without anie publike authoritie, or leaue to set them fr&eacute;e,
went home to defend their owne possessions; and a portion of that monie, which they had
gathered to hire souldiers, was giuen to the said lord Hume, to strengthen his castell of
Hume. Thomas Kar, and Walter Scot (who were iudged to haue made some roads into
England by the persuasion of the bishop of saint Andrews, whereby wars should rise in
England) being forsaken of those which inhabited neere these places, &amp; fearing their owne
estate, sent vnto the chiefe of the faction, requesting helpe of them: or if they would not
doo so, that at least they should come to Lowther the next towne; and from thence shew
or make warre vpon England. Which when they could not obteine (nor anie of the publike monie) they foorthwith departed to their owne lands in great anger.</p>
<p>After this, whilest manie other things passed, as that the qu&eacute;ens faction sent an ambassador to the earle of Sussex, to staie his iournie into Scotland; that they also sent letters to
the qu&eacute;ene of England concerning their cause; and that a seruant of monsieur Lausac in
France, had brought letters to the qu&eacute;ens factions (with thanks for their fidelitie) directed
also vnto other that were indifferent, to ioine with the imprisoned qu&eacute;ene; and that he promised them aid out of France; and that the queens people were assured, that the kings part
would come to Edenburgh at the kalends of Maie: after all these things (I say) they of the
qu&eacute;ens side departed to Lithquo, supposing that place most commodious to assemble their
confederats. Whither when the Hamiltons and their clients were come, they beset all the
way to Edenburgh: for when they vnderstood that Iohn Areskin earle of Mar was comming
thither, they laid ambushes vnder the next hils to intrap him.</p>
<p>But he knowing the iniurie of the place, passed the riuer two miles aboue, and came
to Edenburgh the third day of Maie about euening. Shortlie after, the kings part remaining at Edenburgh, and the qu&eacute;ens at Lithquo, the thre&eacute; earls, Arran, Argile, and
Huntleie appoint a parlement at Lithquo, the thr&eacute;e nones of August. The other faction
sent Robert Petcarne ambassador to the qu&eacute;ene of England, to intreat with hir about the
suppression of the common enimie; and further to let hir vnderstand, that such were the
good minds of the Scots vnto hir, that they would choose a regent by hir appointment.</p>
<p>Besides which, the said lords of the kings part with generall consent wrote letters vnto
the erle of Lennox, then remaining in England, to repaire home with all conuenient sp&eacute;ed
into Scotland. &para; Ye maie read in the historie of England, in what sort the erle of Sussex
lord lieutenant of the north parts, entring into Tiuidale the seuen &amp; twentith of Aprill,
burnt the Mosse tower, the towne of Crawling, the castell of Ferniherst, the towne of Howike, and the castell of Brauxton, that belonged to the laird of Buclewgh, with diuerse
other castels, piles, towns, villages, and hamlets belonging to the lairds of Ferniherst, Buclewgh, and others in those parts: also how the lord Scroope inuaded the west borders of
Scotland at the same time: and likewise how the said earle of Sussex wan the castell

of Hume, with diuerse other matters which here I passe ouer, referring you to the said
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox sent forward to returne into Scotland.</note>
historie.</p>
<p>But now about the same time, the earle of Lennox, hauing got licence of the queene of
England to make his returne into Scotland, was set forward, and came to Berwike towards
the latter end of Aprill, where being visited with sickenesse, he remained by the space of
fourt&eacute;ene daies or more. In the meane time the duke of Chatelerault, the earles of 
<note place="marg">The duke of Chatelerault gathereth a power.</note>
Huntleie, and Cassils, the lord Fleming, and sundrie others of that faction, s&eacute;eing the time
serued well for their purpose, now that the regent was slaine and dispatched out of the waie,
gathered a power, to the number of three thousand men, and came downe to Edenburgh.
But after that they had knowledge that the erle of Lennox was comming out of England
with a power of Englishmen, by the qu&eacute;ens maiesties appointment; aswell for the safegard
of the yoong king, as also for the safe conduct of the earle of Lennox home into Scotland:
the duke and earles aforesaid retired themselues from Edenburgh to Glascow, where they
<note place="marg">The duke retireth to Glascow.</note>
besieged the castell by the space of fiue or six daies, vntill the earle of Lennox approched
thitherwards. For ye haue to vnderstand, that after the earle of Lennox was recouered of
his sickenesse, there was appointed a power of horssemen and footmen, to go with him into
Scotland, vnder the leading of sir William Drurie; as in the English storie ye may read
more at large.</p>
<p>There were diuerse valiant capteins and gentlemen that went with him in that iournie,
aswell such as had charge, as those that went with him of their owne good wils, to s&eacute;e the
order of things, and to helpe to aduance their princes seruice. With charge there were
<note place="marg">Capteins and gentlemen that went with the earle of Lennox into Scotland.</note>
these; sir George Carie capteine of an hundred lances, Henrie Austell capteine of fiftie
lances, William Gurleie capteine of fiftie lances, maister Henrie Carie capteine of two hundred light horssemen, capteine Case lieutenant of the generals band of light horssemen, being also two hundred: sir Robert Constable sergeant maior of the footbands, sir Thomas
Maners, capteine Brikwell, capteine Caruill, capteine Game, capteine Lambard, capteine
Erington, Iohn Constable, and Humfreie Berwike leaders of the footmen. Capteine Erington was also lieutenant to sir George Caries companie of lances. Other gentlemen that
went of their owne good wils, there were diuers; as maister George Deuereux, sir Ierome
Bowes, maister William Knolles, maister Robert Knolles, maister Michaell Carie, maister
Gawdie, maister William Drurie of Suffolke cousine to the generall, maister Greuill, brother
to sir Fulke Greuill, maister Conweie, brother to sir Iohn Conweie, maister Edmund Verneie,
and manie others, whose names I could not learne.</p>
<p>The footmen laie the first night at Coldingham. The next day the earle of Lennox
himselfe with sir William Drurie and the horssemen ouertooke the footmen, and lodged that
night at Dunbar. The next day they made such sp&eacute;ed in their march, that they came
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox with the Englishmen come to Edenburgh.</note>
through to Edenburgh, where they found the earles of Morton, Murreie, Glencarne, the
lords Ruthwen, Lindseie, Sempill, Glamis, Methuen, Ogiltr&eacute;e, and Cathcart, with diuerse
gentlemen of the kings side: who receiued the said earle of Lennox, and the Englishmen
verie courteouslie. From Edenburgh they passed to Lithquho, as in the English historie it
maie appeare: and from thence the footmen passed to Faukirke, and there lodged. But the

persons in all; and yet they kept it fiue or six daies against the duke and his whole power,
slaieng (as hath b&eacute;ene reported) aboue fortie or fiftie of his men; but in the end they
were in great danger to haue b&eacute;ene taken, if they had not b&eacute;ene the more sp&eacute;edilie relieued.

<p>After that the earle of Lennox and his friends were thus come vnto Glascow, finding the
siege raised, he remained there by the space of fiue or six daies. During which time, there
came to him of his kinred and friends, which owght him their seruice, according to the
vse of the countrie, the number of foure thousand men, verie well appointed after their
<note place="marg">A muster of foure thousand Scots.</note>

<note place="marg">S&eacute;e more hereof in England.</note>
maner; the more part out of the countries of Lennox and Darneleie, which mustered before
the said earle, and sir William Drurie, generall of the English there. This doone, the earle
of Lennox, accompanied with the earles and lords before mentioned, &amp; likewise with the
Englishmen, marched to Hamilton, where they entred into the palace belonging to the
duke, and lodged therein that night.</p>
<p>The next day they besieged the castell, whereof Andrew Hamilton of Merinton was 
<note place="marg">The castell of Hamilton besieged.</note>
capteine, hauing vnder him fiftie souldiers to defend it; and would not therefore deliuer it,
till that two p&eacute;eces of great ordinance being brought from Sterling, were planted in batterie.
For then perceiuing themselues in danger to be taken by force, the capteine offered to yeeld
the house to the Englishmen; but not to the lords of Scotland, with condition, to haue the
liues of all them within saued. Which was granted, vpon promise, that they should neuer
<note place="marg">It is deliuered to the Englishmen.</note>
after beare arms against their king, and to depart the realme within a certeine terme, and
herevnto they were sworne. But they kept not long their oth, for the night next insuing,
they did beset the lord Sempill that was lodged at that present in a house not far off, and
<note place="marg">The lord Sempill taken.</note>
not able to keepe it till rescue came, yeelded it and himselfe prisoner, so that he was kept
by the Hamiltons in safe custodie by the space of twelue moneths after. The castell of
<note place="marg">The castell of Hamilton blowen vp and raced.</note>
Hamilton being yeelded (as ye haue heard) was blowen vp with powder. Diners other
houses there in the countrie about were burnt also, as Roplocke, the abbat of Kilwinnings
house, with diuerse other of the Hamiltons houses in Cliddesdale.</p>
<p>After the castell of Hamilton was thus woone and ouerthrowen, the lords returned to the
palace, and lodged there againe that night; and on the morrow, they set fire both vpon the
<note place="marg">The towne and palace of Hamilton burnt.</note>
same palace, and also vpon the towne of Hamilton: and therewith the Englishmen taking
leaue of the lords in Scotland, departed homewards; as in the English historie ye may reade
more at large. The erle of Morton went with them; but the earle of Lennox and the
other earles and lords with their companies tooke their way towards Glascow, and from
thence euerie of the noble men departed home to their houses. Shortlie after, there was
<note place="marg">A conuention of the lords.</note>

<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox made regent.</note>
a conuention of the lords at Striueling, where the earle of Lennox was made lord lieutenant
of Scotland: and afterwards in August following, there was an other conuention at Edenburgh, where, by the consent of the three estates of the realme, the said earle was made
regent of Scotland.</p>
<p>And about the same time, the earle of Huntleie tooke vpon him to be lieutenant of 
<note place="marg">The earle of Huntleie.</note>
Scotland for the qu&eacute;ene of Scots that remained still in England, and therevpon in hir name
summoned a parlement to be holden at Lithquho the one and twentith of September then
<note place="marg">A parlement proclamed by both the factions at one day and place.</note>
next following. Vnto the which parlement, aswell the earle of Lennox then regent, as all
the residue of the lords of both parties were summoned. Whereof the regent being aduertised, caused a parlement to be summoned in the kings name to be kept at Lithquho,
at the selfe same day which was appointed by the earle Huntleie. At which day there
appeared the lords of the kings partie, &amp; also sundrie great lards, knights, and gentlemen,
<note place="marg">The earle of Huntleie commeth no n&eacute;erer than Brechine.</note>
to the number of eight thousand, verie well furnished, looking for the earle of Huntleis
comming, according to his appointed order; but he came no n&eacute;erer than Brechine.</p>
<p>Wherevpon it was decr&eacute;ed by the regent and nobilitie there, to pursue him: and to that
end, Iames Dowglas earle of Morton was sent before with a thousand horssemen to haue
taken him vpon the sudden in the towne of Brechine, before he should haue anie warning
of their comming, the regent following after with an armie. But Huntlie hauing warning
<note place="marg">The earle of Huntleie escapeth.</note>
of their approch, escaped their hands, although verie narrowlie; in somuch that some of
his footmen were so put to their shifts, that they were driuen for their refuge (being so beset
on the sudden) to take the castell of Brechine: the earle of Huntleie promising before
he went from them, to succour them within eight daies; but they being streictlie besieged,

and the eale not k&eacute;eping promise with them, after those eight daies were expired, they
y&eacute;elded themselues and the castell vnto the regents mercie.</p>
<p>They were in all about thr&eacute;e hundred, of which number one and thirtie of the chiefest
were executed. Some of them had borne arms against the king before that time, and had
<note place="marg">Execution.</note>
beene pardoned, and therefore were now thought by the regent and his friends the more
worthie to die. After this, the regent returned to Striueling, and from thence passed to the
castell of Downe, and besieged it; being kept by the seruants of the lord of saint Colmes
<note place="marg">The castell of Downe y&eacute;elded.</note>
Inch, who y&eacute;elded it to the regent after thr&eacute;e daies siege. During the time of the regents
being there, he sent one of his seruants called Iohn Moone, with letters into England, directed to the qu&eacute;ene of Englands councell: who (for his secret practising and conference
had with such as were enimies to the king and regent before his departure out of Scotland,
and for receiuing of their letters to be conueied also, and herewith discouering sundrie secrets
to them, the which were committed vnto his credit and trust) was apprehended, and the same
letters which he had secretlie receiued being found vpon him, and the matters aforesaid
proued against him, he was by law executed.</p>
<p>About the same time the earle of Morton, the abbat of Dunfermeling, and Iames Macgili,
<note place="marg">Commissioners sent into England.</note>
clearke of the register, were sent into England commissioners vpon the kings partie; the
bishop of Rosse, the abbat of Kilwinning, &amp; the lord Leuingston, appointed for the qu&eacute;ene
then being in England. In Ianuarie following, the regent then being at Edenburgh, Claud
Hamilton, one of the duke of Chateleraults sonnes, entred the house of Pasleie, then being
<note place="marg">Pasleie taken and kept by Claud Hamilton.</note>
kept by the seruants of the lord Sempill: and seizing vpon all things which they found as
stood with his pleasure, he fortified the house with men, munition, and vittels, such as he
could get either in the towne of Pasleie, or neere thereabouts. The regent aduertised
thereof, repaired thither with a power in all sp&eacute;edie wise, and laid siege to the house. They
<note place="marg">The regent besiegeth Pasleie.</note>
within sued for a truce, which was granted to them for the space of six daies, the better to
aduise of their owne estate: which terme being expired, proclamation was made by the regent, that if they would yeeld the house, so manie of them as had not borne armes before
that time against the king and regent, should haue their liues saued, the rest to remaine at
the regents pleasure.</p>
<p>Herevpon contention rose among them within the house: for whereas the more part of
them hauing not serued in anie iournie or exploit against the king before that time, would
n&eacute;eds y&eacute;eld; the other, being the lesse number, were not able to defend it of themselues.
Wherevpon they were readie to draw their weapons one against another; but yet in the end
they agr&eacute;ed to surrender the house, and y&eacute;elded themselues, vpon such condition as the
<note place="marg">Pasleie is surrendred to the regent.</note>
regent had prescribed: wherevpon fiue of them were executed, &amp; all the rest were pardoned
of their liues. The capteine Iohn Hamilton, lard of Coughnall, and his two brethren excepted, who were sent to the castell of Glascow, there to remaine in prison, and shortlie
after the said Iohn Hamilton was executed.</p>
<p>In March following, the regent returned to Glascow, and for that Gilbert Kennedie
<note place="marg"><date>1571.</date></note>
with the erles of Cassils &amp; Eglenton refused to shew themselues obedient to the king, and
would not come to the regent, who had sent for them by letters at sundrie times, the regent
gathered his power at Glascow, and with the same marched towards Vrwin and Air, and
so forward to the earle of Cassils countrie, who hearing of the regents comming, sent foorth
<note place="marg">The regent goeth against the earle of Cassils.</note>
his brother to offer his submission. Wherevpon it was concluded, that the messenger
should remaine with the regent as pledge for his brother, by the space of twentie daies:
and then the said earle to make his appearance before the regent at Striueling, to answere
such matters as should be laid to his charge.</p>
<p>The same time also Hugh Montgomerie earle of Eglenton, and Robert Boid leuied their
bands also to appeare and answer in like sort: and as well the one as the other (according
to their assurance giuen) appeared at the day appointed; but yet not agr&eacute;eing to such
articles as were required of them, they were both committed to prison, the one in the castell
<note place="marg">The earles of Cassils and Eglenton committed to ward.</note>
of Dunbreton, &amp; the other in the castell of Downe. Afterwards there was a truce taken

betw&eacute;ene the regent, the Hamiltons, and their adherents for twentie daies, to wit, vntill the
<note place="marg">A truce for twentie daies.</note>
last of March. Which truce once ended, the regent determined with himselfe to giue an
attempt to the castell of Dunbreton, which had beene long kept by the lord Fleming against
the king, and the earle of Murreie late regent, who had besieged it for the space of halfe a
y&eacute;ere or more, but could not by anie meanes compasse to win it.</p>
<p>But now on the first of Aprill, the truce being then expired, the regent going forward with
his purpose, caused all the passages round about the countrie to be stopped, as well by land
as by water; and the same night sent thitherward captein Thomas Crawford, and capteine
Hume, with an hundred souldiers, chosen out for the purpose: who the second of Aprill,
about foure of the clocke in the morning, came to the castell, where the souldiers with
ladders, ropes, and other deuises, found meanes to clime vp the rocke, which is of an exceeding great heigth, and so with great paine, and more danger, at length got vp to the
wall of the castell, standing vpon the heigth of the rocke, to the which wall they reared vp
a ladder, by the which entered first one Alexander Ramsie, ensigne bearer to capteine 
<note place="marg">The castell of Dunbreton taken by a policie.</note>
Crawford, &amp; leaping ouer the wall, was streightwaies assailed by three of the watchmen, of the
which he slue one: and a souldier named Wederborne that followed him, being the second
that entered, slue another of them: the third of those watchmen was also slaine, as he was
about to fl&eacute;e from them.</p>
<p>Herewith capteine Crawford &amp; capteine Hume got ouer the wall, and entering the castell
<note place="marg">Capteine Crawford &amp; capteine Hume.</note>
with the rest of their souldiers, stroke vp the drum, &amp; cried; A Derneleie, being their
watchword; and seizing vpon the ordinance, manned the same. The lord Fleming capteine
of the castell, hearing that sudden fright and tumult within the house, fled out by the 
<note place="marg">The lord Fleming escapeth.</note>
posterne gate at the neither baile, and so escaping, got a fishers boat, and passed into Argile.
The souldiers of the castell, perceiuing their captein fled, and the castell possessed by the
enimies, y&eacute;elded themselues, and were pardoned. There were taken within the castell
Iohn Hamilton, the archbishop of saint Andrews, monsieur de Veriacke a Frenchman, sent
thither by the French, king, also the ladie Fleming, wife to the lord Fleming, and Iohn Fleming lard of Boghall Alexander the sonne of William Leuingston, and Iohn Hall an 
<note place="marg">Iohn Hall.</note>
Englishman, being partener of a new intended conspiracie, as was after prooued against him, for
the which he was arreigned, condemned, and executed at London; as in the English historie
appeareth.</p>
<p>The third of April, being the morrow after that Dunbreton was thus strangelie woone,
the regent came thither, and entered the same, where he calling the capteins and souldiers
togither, caused them with him to kn&eacute;ele downe vpon their kn&eacute;es, and to giue God humble
thanks for their good successe in that enterprise, brought to passe rather by the prouidence
of God than otherwise, sith the castell seemed to all those that knew it, impossible in maner
<note place="marg">The strong situation of the castell of Dunbreton.</note>
to be woone, by reason of the great heigth of the rocke, and the strange siuation, being
inuironed almost round about with the water of Clide on the one side, and the water of
Leuin on the other. The report of the winning of this castell was ioifull to the townes and
countries about, which before had b&eacute;ene a continuall scourge to them, by reason that the
souldiers that kept it, would issue out at sundrie times, robbing, spoiling, and carieng
awaie the commodities of the inhabitants there abouts, as well by land as by water.</p>
<p>The regent deait verie honorablie with the ladie Fleming, suffering hir to depart away
<note place="marg">The ladie Fleming honorablie intreated.</note>
with all such plate and iewes, as apperteined either to hir or hir husband. He granted also
a safe conduct to monsieur de Veriacke, to passe homewards through the countrie, but the
archbishop of saint Andrews was sent prisoner to Striueling. The spoile of the goods found
in the castell was giuen to the souldiers that ventured so dangerouslie to atchiue so high
an enterprise, bringing it to the wished effect by policie with so little bloudshed as deserueth
perpetuall remembrance. The day next insuing, being the fourth of Aprill, the regent
appointed Iohn Cuningham lard of Drumwhassell, a man of good seruice, and seruant to
the regent, to be capteine of that castell, and leauing him therein, departed to Striueling,
where he caused the archbishop of saint Andrews to be examined vpon certeine articles, as

well touching the murther of the late king Henrie, as also for the death of the earle of
Murreie the late regent.</p>
<p>At what time there came in a priest without compulsion of anie (as hath b&eacute;ene said) and
before the regent declared, that one Iohn Hamilton, being in extreme sicknesse, vnder confession told him, that the bishop did send him with thr&eacute;e others to the murther of the king.
And as touching the murther of the erle of Murreie, the bishops flat answer was, he might
<note place="marg">The archbishop of saint Andrews executed.</note>
haue letted it if he would. Therewith the people that heard him, cried, Awaie with him,
hang him. And so for these and other offenses, for the which he had beene forfalted afore
that time, he was now executed on a gibet, set vp in the market place of Striueling towne.
After this, the regent summoned a parlement, to begin at Edenburgh the fourteenth of Maie
<note place="marg">A parlement summoned.</note>
next insuing, and passed from Striueling to Lithquo.</p>
<p>Here the earle of Morton (with the rest of the commissioners for the kings part, being
returned out of England, with other of the nobilitie) met the regent, and then they passed
toward Edenburgh, where they thought to haue b&eacute;ene receiued, and so to haue kept the
parlement there. But they were not suffered to enter that towne, nor yet the castell, the
same being defended against them by the lard of Grange, who after the death of the earle
<note place="marg">The castell of Edenburgh kept by the lard of Grange against the regent.</note>
of Murreie, was reuolted from the kings part to the Hamiltons side, and had fortified both
the towne and castell: so that the regent and nobilitie being kept out there, held their
parlement in the Cannogate str&eacute;et, within the suburbs of the towne, where sundrie of the
qu&eacute;enes part were forfalted. This being doone, and sundrie skirmishes had with them that
issued foorth of the towne against them without, the regent returned to Striueling, there to
remaine for a season.</p>
<p>In the meane time the earle of Morton, hauing certeine stuffe come foorth of England by
<note place="marg">The lard of Carmichell.</note>
sea, and brought to land at Leith, sent the lard of Carmichell with his houshold seruants,
&amp; two hundred shot, to fetch the same from thence vnto Dalketh, being fiue miles distant
from Leith. At their returne with the stuffe, they were set vpon by the earle of Huntleie,
and the lord Hume, who issued out of Edenburgh with their power: so that betwixt them
was a verie hot skirmish. But in the end the earle of Huntleie, &amp; the lord Hume were
<note place="marg">The earle of Huntleie and lord Hume put to flight.</note>
constreined to flie, and were pursued by Carmichell and his companie euen vnto the gates
of Edenburgh, some of their men b&eacute;eing slaine, and others taken prisoners. For reuenge
of which ouerthrow, shortlie after the earle of Huntleie, and Claud Hamilton, with their
forces marched from Edenburgh, to Dalketh, purposing to haue spoiled the towne.</p>
<p>But the earle of Morton, hauing knowledge of their intention and comming, sallied
foorth of Dalketh with the power which he had there with him, although not comparable
in number to his aduersaries; &amp; meeting them in the field, there was a sharpe skirmish
betwixt them, and manie hurt on both parties: but in the end the earle of Morton was put
<note place="marg">The earle of Morton put to the worse.</note>
to the worse, fourtie or more of his men taken prisoners. And the cause was, for that his
footmen were too forward, wanting helpe of their horssemen that should haue succoured
them. About the fiue &amp; twentith day of Maie following, capteine Cullen issued foorth of
Edenburgh with two hundred shot, meaning to intercept certeine harquebusers, which were
appointed to come out of Fife ouer the riuer of the Forth, vnto the earle of Morton, who
kept still at Dalketh.</p>
<p>Wherevpon the said earle, hauing knowledge of Cullens enterprise, aduertised the regent
therof, who being then at Striueling, the next day came downe to Dunfermling in Fife.
But before his comming thither, Cullen had met with a bote vpon the water, wherein were
aboord fiue and twentie shot, whome he tooke prisoners, and led them awaie with him to
Edenburgh. The next day the earle of Morton came to Leith, where he met with sir William
Drurie, and there they lodged that night. The next morning sir William Drurie passing
foorth of Leith towards Edenburgh, accompanied with sundrie capteins, and other gentlemen
for his conuoie thither, they within Edenburgh perceiuing them comming, imagined that
they were come foorth to offer a skirmish, wherevpon they issued out of the towne and castell
to incounter them.</p>

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"So"</fw>-->

<pb n="651"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"651"</fw>-->

<p>So that being readie on either side to begin the skirmish, sir William Drurie, being
come to talke with the parties for some accord to be had, tooke in hand with great diligence
to appease them: and at length procured them to agr&eacute;e vpon a truce to indure till eight of
the clocke at night. But yet when both parts staied in the fields for the space of an houre,
because they could not agr&eacute;e whether companie shuld first retire from the field, they fell
at length in skirmish (notwithstanding the truce) and fought verie sharplie for the time, till
<note place="marg">A skirmish.</note>

<note place="marg">The abbat of Kilwinning slaine.</note>

<note place="marg">The lord Hume and capteine Cullen taken.</note>
in the end they of the towne and castell had the ouerthrow: the abbat of Kilwinning being
slaine, with diuerse other; and there were taken aboue an hundred prisoners: amongest the
which the lord Hume, and capteine Cullen were accounted principall. Those that escaped
were chased &amp; constreined for their safetie to flee into the towne of Edenburgh, &amp; capteine
Cullen was afterwards beheaded.</p>
<p>The regent immediatlie after this skirmish came with all sp&eacute;ed to Leith, as well to fortifie
the towne, as to make some further attempt against his aduersaries within the towne and
castell of Edenburgh. Herevpon was Leith [whose capteine was Patrike Lindseie] 
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>

<note place="marg">Leith fortified.</note>
intrenched round about, being est&eacute;emed a place of great importance, standing both in the face of
the enimies, and so readie to annoie them, and also seruing well to preuent them of such succour as they looked for dailie out of France. In this meane time, the lard of Grange, then
capteine of the castell, and prouost of the towne of Edenburgh, caused proclamation to be
<note place="marg">A proclamation.</note>
made, that all those inhabitants which were not willing to take part with him in his dooings,
should depart out of the towne. Wherevpon, manie of them departed thence, togither with
their wiues and children, and tooke with them also such goods as they could secretlie conueie: and comming to Leith, offered their seruice vnto the regent, who thankfullie accepted
their offer: and so they remained at Leith, seruing against the contrarie faction vpon their
owne expenses.</p>
<p>After this, the lard of Grange, vnderstanding that report had bene made by some of the
<note place="marg">The challenge of the lard of Grange.</note>
kings part, that he was a traitor to the king, and an enimie to his countrie, offered the combat to anie that would iustifie the same. Which being aduertised to them within Leith, diuerse gentlemen were desirous to vndertake the challenge: but the regent granted it to the
lard of Garlisch, being a Steward, &amp; his kinsman, who had earnestlie requested it. 
<note place="marg">The lard of Garlisch.</note>
Wherevpon, after diuerse messages by heralds sent to and fro betwixt them, the time and place was
appointed; but the matter went not forward, excuse being made on the behalfe of the lard
Grange, that by reason of the charge which was committed to him, it was not thought conuenient that he should hazard the whole cause vpon his owne person.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, there came out of France one Iohn Cheseholme, who was sent with monie
<note place="marg">Iohn Cheseholme.</note>
to the lard of Grange for the paiment of his souldiors: he brought with him also a certeine
quantitie of powder, and thr&eacute;e hundred caleeuers. Vpon his entering into the water of
Fourth, and comming vp the same, he learned how the regent was in Leith: wherevpon he
landed at Brent Iland, and afterwards for feare hid himselfe betwixt two clifs of a rocke,
not farre from the qu&eacute;enes ferrie: but at length he was found out by the abbat of saint Colmes
Inch, and deliuered to the regent at Leith, in which towne the said regent laie about two
moneths, vsing sundrie meanes, as well by practise and policie, as by force to haue taken
the towne of Edenburgh. In the meane time sundrie skirmishes chanced betwixt them,
and diuerse prisoners were taken on either part.</p>
<p>At length, the regent caused a parlement to be summoned, appointing the same to be
<note place="marg">A parlement summoned.</note>
holden at Striueling the two &amp; twentith of August next insuing. And when that day ap
proched, he left the lord Lindseie at Leith in charge, as his lieutenant to gouerne the towne, and
all the men of warre appointed to remaine in gard thereof; and repaired himselfe to Striueling,
where at the prefixed daie did assemble the earles of Morton, Mar, Crawford, Sutherland,
Montrosse, Eglenton, Glencarne, the lords Ruthwen, Glamis, Methwen, Sempill, Ogiltree, and Cathcart, with manie lards and gentlemen. The first day of this parlement the
king was conueied thither, the crowne, scepter, and swoord being borne before him.</p>
<p>When he had taken his place, he vttered a certeine speech as had b&eacute;ene taught him,

<!--<fw place="top-left">"652"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

touching the assembling of that parlement, which matter the regent more at large declared vnto the
whole house: and this doone, they proc&eacute;eded further to other affaires, concerning the state
of the common-wealth. Moreouer in this parlement, the duke of Chatelerault with his two
<note place="marg">The duke of Chatelerault forfalted.</note>
sonnes, the abbat of Arbroth, and Claud Hamilton, the earle of Huntleie, the lard of Grange
and sundrie others were forfalted. This parlement continued by the space of seuen daies:
at the end whereof, to wit, vpon the second of September, Claud Hamilton, the lard of
Bouclugh, the lard of Ormiston, and diuerse others, to the number of thr&eacute;e hundred horssemen, verie earlie in the morning entered the towne of Striueling, and suddenlie beset not
onelie the regent, but also the rest of the nobilitie within their lodgings.</p>
<p>The regent hearing a great vprore raised within the towne [in which George Ruthwen was
<note place="marg"><emph>Fr. Thin.</emph></note>
slaine] and not vnderstanding the cause, nor who were the authors thereof, after he perceiued how the house wherein he lodged was beset on ech side, he defended the same against
the enimies for a good space: but at length despairing of succours, and doubting least the
house had b&eacute;ene vnderlaid with some barrels of powder, aud that it would be blowen vp
if he y&eacute;elded not as some told him: and the enimie to increase that doubt, crieng still;
Blow vp the house, what shuld we stand longer about him? at length he was contented to
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox taken in his lodging.</note>
y&eacute;eld to the lard of Ormiston, but not before he saw that some of his stoutest capteins had
y&eacute;elded themselues before his face. He y&eacute;elded, with condition to haue his life saued: but
promise in that behalfe was not long kept. For those that had thus taken him, when they
perceiued rescue comming downe from the castell, so that they should not be able to carrie him awaie, capteine Cauder with a pistolet shot him into the bodie, before he could be 
<note place="marg">The earle of Lennox wounded.</note>
recouered out of their hands.</p>
<p>The rest of the nobilitie, to wit, the earles of Morton, Eglenton, and Glencarne, and diuerse other being taken prisoners, were presentlie rescued by those that issued out of the castell. The earle of Morton being in the hands of the lard of Bouclugh, tooke the same lard
prisoner, he y&eacute;elding himselfe vnto him: and likewise the earle of Glencarne tooke his k&eacute;eper prisoner, and so did sundrie others take their takers: but Claud Hamilton, with others
their companies, hauing first gotten all the horsses that were found in the towne into their
hands, when they heard that the rescue was comming, shifted for themselues, and fled awaie.
The regent, being mortallie wounded, but yet deliuered from his enimies, rid vp to the castell, and calling there vnto him the whole nobilitie, when he perceiued his end to approch, he
vsed these woords (or the like in substance) as followeth.</p>
<p>"My lords, it is not vnknowen vnto you all, that my comming hither to take this

which chieflie mooued me heerevnto, was, for the defense of the kings person, being yet (as
you s&eacute;e) an infant; of whome by nature and dutie I was bounden to haue carefull consideration, and that in his minoritie, the good and quiet gouernement of this common-wealth
might be aduanced, and iustice executed vpon those that most cruellie did murther the late
king, my sonne the kings father, and his vncle the good earle of Murreie, late regent: whose
misch&eacute;euous and diuelish deuises if in time you doo not preuent by your wisedoms and discretions, they will procure the finall ouerthrow and destruction of you all. In this action
(as you s&eacute;e) I haue spent my bloud, and haue plaied the last part of my tragedie, and now
I f&eacute;ele death to draw n&eacute;ere at hand.</p>
<p>"Wherefore I require you all, for the due regard that you haue of your duties, first to
almightie God, and next to the king your most lawfull and naturall prince now in these his
tender y&eacute;eres, wholie to imploie your seruice in his defense, with care to mainteine the state
of this common-wealth, whereby you shall not onelie accomplish your duties towards God,
but shall be assured to find in your king in time to come (God lending him life) all that good
which you can iustlie require. And I shall further commit to your friendlie protection, my poore
seruants, who for their good seruice haue well deserued, and yet remaine vnrecompensed,
desiring you all to be good to them. And lastlie, I desire you to commend me vnto the

<p>&para; Thus haue I hitherto continued this historie of Scotland, not so largelie nor perfectlie
as I could haue wished, but skambled forward with it in such sort as you maie s&eacute;e; hauing
deliuered nothing vnto you to impaire the credit of the Scotish nation, otherwise than I haue
found in authors, or learned by credible report (as I take it) hauing put off the parciall affection, which I beare of dutie to mine owne countrie, in this respect, that I shuld not s&eacute;eme
to wrest the woords of writers, either to the aduantage of the English people, or disaduantage of the Scots, speciallie in politike gouernement, warlike exploits, ciuill demeanor,
and other vertuous exercises: which as I haue found them either in anie one person particularlie, or in the multitude in generall; so haue I reported the same, not sparing the truth

in no wise presuming (as else-where I haue said) to vse mine owne censure, but rather
leauing the iudgement of other mens reports vnto the readers discretion. To whome I wish
such vnderstanding and knowledge in the truth, as maie satisfie himselfe, and redound to
the publike commoditie of his countrie, and pleasure of the almightie; in whose hands are
the hearts of kings &amp; gouernors, guiding the states of realms and common wealths, as to
his diuine wisedome s&eacute;emeth most expedient. To whome be glorie, honor, and praise for
euermore; Amen.</p>
