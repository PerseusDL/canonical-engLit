<p>MY verie good Lord, there haue beene diuerse of late, that with no
small toile, and great commendation, haue throughlie imploied themselues,
in culling and packing togither the scrapings and fragments of the
historie of Ireland. Among which crue, my fast friend, and inward companion,
maister Edmund Campion did so learnedlie bequite himselfe, in the
penning of certeine breefe notes, concerning that countrie, as certes it was
greatlie to be lamented, that either his theame had not beene shorter, or else
his leasure had not beene longer. For if Alexander were so rauisht with
Homer his historie, that notwithstanding Thersites were a crabbed and a
rugged dwarfe, being in outward feature so deformed, and in inward conditions
so crooked, as he seemed to stand to no better steed, than to lead apes
in hell: yet the valiant capteine, weighing how liuelie the golden poet hath
set forth the ouglie dandeprat in his colours, did sooner wish to be Homer his
Thersites, than to be the Alexander of that doltish rithmour, which vndertooke
with his woodden verses to blase his famous and martiall exploits:
how much more ought Ireland (being in sundrie ages seized of diuerse
good and couragious Alexanders) sore to long and thirst after so rare a clarke,
as maister Campion, who was so vpright in conscience, so deepe in iudgement,
so ripe in eloquence, as the countrie might haue beene well assured
to haue had their historie trulie reported, pithilie handled, and brauelie
polished.</p>

<p>Howbeit, although the glose of his fine abbridgement, being matcht with
other mens dooings, bare a surpassing kind of excellencie: yet it was so
hudled vp in hast, as in respect of a Campion his absolute perfection, it
seemed rather to be a woorke roughlie hewed, than smoothlie planed.
Vpon which ground the gentleman being willing that his so tender a
suckling, hauing as yet but greene bones, should haue beene swadled and
rockt in a cradle, till in tract of time the ioints thereof were knit, and
growen stronger: yet notwithstanding he was so crost in the nicke of this
determination, that his historie in mitching wise wandred through sundrie
hands, and being therewithall in certeine places somewhat tickle toonged
(for maister Campion did learne it to speake) and in other places ouer
spare, it twitled more tales out of schoole, and drowned weightier matters
in silence, than the author (vpon better view and longer search) would
haue permitted. Thus much being by the sager sort pondered, and the
perfection of the historic earnestlie desired: I, as one of the most that could
doo least, was fullie resolued to inrich maister Campion his chronicle, with
further additions. But weighing on the other side, that my course pack-thred
could not haue beene sutablie knit with his fine silke, and what a
disgrace it were, bungerlie to botch vp a rich garment, by clouting it with
patches of sundrie colours, I was forthwith reclaimed from my former resolution,
reckoning it for better, that my pen should walke in such wise in that
craggie and balkish waie, as the truth of the matter being forprised, I
would neither openlie borrow, nor priuilie imbezell ought to anie great
purpose from his historie. But as I was hammering that worke by stealths
on the anuill, I was giuen to vnderstand by some of mine acquaintance,
that others had brought our raw historie to that ripenesse, as my paine therein
would seeme but needlesse. Wherevpon being willing to be eased of the
burden, and loath also in lurching wise to forstall anie man his trauell, I
was contented to leaue them thumping in the forge, and quietlie to repaire
to mine vsuall and pristinat studies, taking it not to stand with good maners,
like a flittering flie to fall in an other man his dish. Howbeit the little paine
I tooke therein was not so secretlie mewed within my closet, but it slipt out
at one chinke or other, and romed so farre abroad, as it was whispered in
their eares, who before were in the historic busied. The gentlemen conceiuing
a greater opinion of me, than I was well able to vphold, dealt
verie effectuallie with me, that as well at their instance, as for the affection
I bare my natiue countrie, I would put mine helping hand to the
building and perfecting of so commendable a worke.   Hauing breathed
for a few daies on this motion, albeit I knew that my worke was plumed
with downe, and at that time was not sufficientlie feathered to flie: yet
I was by them weied not to beare my selfe coy, by giuing my entier friends
in so reasonable a request a squemish repulse.   Wherefore, my singular
good lord, here is laid downe to your lordship his view a briefe discourse,
with a iagged historie of a ragged wealepublike. Yet as naked as at
the first blush it seemeth, if it shall stand with your honor his pleasure
(whom I take to be an expert lapidarie) at vacant houres to insearch it,
you shall find therein stones of such estimation, as are worth to be coucht
in rich and pretious collars. And in especiall your lordship, aboue all
others, in that you haue the charge of that countrie, maie here be schooled,
by a right line to leuell your gouernement. For in perusing this historic,
you shall find vice punished, vertue rewarded, rebellion suppressed, loialtie
exalted, haughtinesse disliked, courtesie beloued, briberie detested, iustice
imbraced, polling officers to their perpetuall shame reprooued, and vpright
gouernours to their eternall fame extolled.   And trulie to my thinking,
such magistrats as meane to haue a vigilant eie to their charge, can not
bestow their time better, than when they sequester themselues from the
affaires of the wealepublike, to recreat and quicken their spirits by reading
the chronicles that decipher the gouernement of a wealepublike.
For as it is no small commendation for one to beare the dooings of manie,
so it breedeth great admiration, generallie to haue all those qualities in
one man harbored, for which particularlie diuerse are eternised. And
who so will be addicted to the reading of histories, shall readilie find diuerse
euents worthie to be remembred, and sundrie sound examples dailie to be
followed. Vpon which ground the learned haue, not without cause, adiudged
an historic to be the marrow of reason, the creame of experience,
the sap of wisdome, the pith of iudgement, the librarie of knowledge,
the kernell of policie, the vnfoldresse of treacherie, the kalendar of time,
the lanterne of truth, the life of memorie, the doctresse of behauiour, the
register of antiquitie, the trumpet of chiualrie. And that our Irish historic
being diligentlie heeded, yeeldeth all these commodities, I trust the indifferent
reader, vpon the vntwining thereof, will not denie. But if anie man
his stomach shall be found so tenderlie niced, or so deintilie spiced, as
that he maie not, forsooth, digest the grosse draffe of so base a countrie,
I doubt not, but your lordship, who is thoroughlie acquainted with the
woorthinesse of the Iland, will be soone persuaded to leaue such quaint
and licourous repastours, to feed on their costlie and delicate woodcocks,
&amp; willinglie to accept the louing present of your heartie welwiller. The
gift is small, the giuer his good will is great, I stand in good hope, that the
greatnesse of the one will counterpoise the smalnesse of the other. Wherefore
that I maie the sooner vnbroid the pelfish trash that is wrapt within this
treatise, I shall craue your lordship to lend me either your eares in hearing,
or your eies in reading the tenor of the discourse following.</p>

	  <p>THE more part aswel of Cosmographers, as Chronographers, do with on accorde
affirme, that the nation of Ireland (the vttermost weasterne Ile known) is
halfe as big as Britannia. Which I take to be true, if the word Britannia so farre
displaie the signification, that it comprise England, Wales, and Scotland. To

<note place="marg">The length and breadth of Ireland.</note>

which opinion Giraldus Cambrensis relieth, saieng, that Britannia conteineth in

<note place="marg"><emph>Girald. Cambrens. lib. 1. topog. dist. 1. rub. 2.</emph></note>

length eight hundred miles, and two hundred in breadth. Ireland he taketh to be in
length from the mounteins called Torrach (the author of Polychronicon termeth them

<note place="marg"><emph>Polych. lib. I. cap. 32.</emph></note>

Brendane his hilles) to saint Columbe his Iland eight daies iourneie, rating of long
Irish miles fortie miles to the daie: and in breadth from Dublin to saint Patrike
his hilles and the sea of Connaght foure daies iorneie, according to the former rate.
So as by Cambrensis his surueie, who was a curious insearcher therof, Ireland is
thr&eacute;e hundred &amp; twentie miles long of Irish miles, and one hundred and three score
miles broad. And accounting thr&eacute;e hundred and twentie Irish miles to amount to
foure hundred English miles, which may well be reckoned according to their iudgements
that haue trauelled in the Irish territories; Ireland will be found halfe as big
as Britannia: which Girald. Cambrensis auoucheth, saieng, that Ireland is as big
as Wales and Scotland. Ireland hath on the east, England, within one daies
sailing; on the southeast it hath France; Hispaine on the south, distant thr&eacute;e
daies sailing; on the west the maine ocean sea.</p>

<note place="marg">The name Ibernia whense it proceedeth.</note>

<p>Touching the name Ibernia, historiographers are not yet agreed from whense it
is deducted. Some write it Hibernia corruptlie, and suppose that the strangers
finding it in an od end of the world, foistie and moistie, tooke it at the first for a
verie cold countrie, and thereof named it Hibernia, as to saie, the Winter land.
But this error being vpon short experience reformed, it could not be that the name
should haue liued long, especiallie the first impositors suruiuing the triall, and able

<note place="marg">Ireland.</note>
to alter the first nomination. Others bring a ghesse, that it should be named of
Irlamale. But because I read nothing of them in anie probable historie, I purpose
not to build vpon that coniecture.</p>

<p>Most crediblie it is holden, that the Hispaniards (the founders of the Irish)
for deuotion towards Hispaine, called then Iberia of Iberius the sonne of Iuball,
<note place="marg">Iberus the Hispanish riuer.</note>
and the rather, for that themselues had dwelled beside the famous riuer Iberus,
named the land Iberia (for so Leland and manie forren chroniclers write it) or
<note place="marg"><emph>Leland. in cyg. cant.</emph></note>
Ibernia, adding the letter (n) for difference sake. And from Ibernia proc&eacute;edeth
Iberland, or Iuerland; from Iuerland, by contraction Ireland: forsomuch as in
corruption of common talke we find that (u) with his vocale is easilie lost and suppressed;
so we saie ere for euer, nere for neuer, shoole for shoouell, ore for ouer,
ene for euen, dile for diuell. At the same time it was also named Scotia, in
<note place="marg">Scotia.</note>

<note place="marg">Scotach.</note>

<note place="marg">Gatheius.</note>
reuerence of Scotach the wife of Gathelus, ancient capteine of those Iberians that
flitted from Hispaine into Ireland: &amp; the said Scotach was old grandame to
Hiberus and Hermon after the Scotish chronicles, who in anie wise will haue their
countrimen deriued from the Irish, and not from the Britons. The name Scotia
<note place="marg"><emph>Iohan. maior.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Scot. lib.</emph> 1. <emph>ca.</emph> 9.</note>
is of late yeares so vsuallie taken for that part of Britaine that compriseth Scotland,
that diuerse ancient Irish authors are holden to be borne in Scotland, wheras in
verie d&eacute;ed their natiue soile is Ireland. As the famous schooleman Iohannes Duns
<note place="marg">Iohannes dominus Scotus borne in Ireland.</note>
Scotus, otherwise named Doctor subtilis, for his subtill quiddities in scholasticall
controuersies, was an Irish man borne, and yet is taken for a Scot.</p>
<p>Some hold opinion that he was borne in Thathmon, a market towne fiue miles
distant from Weiseford. Others auouch, and that more trulie, that he was borne
in Downe, an old ancient ciuitie in the north of Ireland, and thereof they ghesse
him to be named Dunensis, and by contraction Duns, which tearme is so triuiall
<note place="marg">Why schoolemen are called Dunses.</note>
and common in all schools, that whoso surpasseth others either in cauilling
sophistrie, or subtill philosophie, is forthwith nickenamed a Duns. Wherefore as
Scotland is named Scotia minor, so Ireland is tearmed Scotia major, as the head
<note place="marg">Scotia maior.</note>

<note place="marg">Scotia minor.</note>
from whense the name of Scotia minor tooke his ofspring. The Irish also were
named of the foresaid Gathelus, or Gaudeilus, Gaudeili. In their Irish rithmes,
<note place="marg">Gaudeili.</note>
they tearme Ireland verie often Banno. I cannot diuine what reason should lead
<note place="marg">Banno.</note>
their makers therto, vnlesse it be the riuer in the countie of Weiseford, named the
Banne, where the Britons vpon the conquest first arriued. The place otherwise is
<note place="marg">The riuer Banne.</note>
called Bagganbun, according to the old ancient rithme:

<note place="marg">Bagganbun.</note>

<l>At the creeke of Bagganbun,</l>
<l>Ireland was lost and wun.</l>
</lg></quote></p>

<p>For the remembrance of which riuer so notoriouslie famosed, it carieth great likelihood,
that the name should be to the whole realme generallie ascribed. Sundrie
Latine authors write Ireland Inuerna, others Iuerna, diuerse Ijerna. Claudius
<note place="marg">Inuerna.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Ioan. Camettes in cap.</emph> 35.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Solini.</emph></note>
nameth it Iberna. The diuersitie of which names grew, for that in their time the
true and certeine name was not knowne, so that they were contented to take it as
they found it, which matter is handled by Hermolaus Barbarus.</p>

<note place="marg">The name Irish and Ireland curiously seuered.</note>
<p>There are some of the ruder sort so quaint in seuering the name Irish and Ireland,
as that they would be named Ireland men, but in no wise Irishmen. But certes, in
my fantasie such curious distinctors may be verie aptlie resembled to the foolish
butcher, that offred to haue sold his mutton for fift&eacute;ene grots, and yet would not
take a crowne. Who so will grate vpon such nice diuersities, in respect that he is
ashamed of his countrie; trulie (in mine opinion) his countrie maie be ashamed of
him. Ireland is diuided into foure regions, Leinster, east: Connaght, west:
<note place="marg">1. Lagenia.</note>

<note place="marg">2. Connatia.</note>

<note place="marg">3. Hultonia.</note>

<note place="marg">4. Momonia.</note>

<note place="marg">5. Media.</note>

<note place="marg">West M&eacute;eth &amp; East M&eacute;eth.</note>
Vlster, north: Mounster, south: and into a fift plot, defalked from euerie fourth
part, and yet mearing on each part, called thereof Media, M&eacute;eth, comprising as
well east M&eacute;eth, as west M&eacute;eth. Leinster butteth vpon England, Ulster vpon the

Scotish Islands: which face with Hebriades scattered betweene both the realms,
<note place="marg">Hebriades.</note>
wherin at this daie the Irish Scot, successor of the elder Scithian, Pict, or Redshanke
dwelleth. Ech of these fiue, where they are framable to ciuilitie, &amp; answer
the writs of the princes courts, be sundred into shires or counties in this manner.
<note place="marg">The shires and counties of Ireland.</note>
In Leinster lieth the counties of Dublin, Kildare, Weiseford, or Gueisford, Catherlach,
Kilkennie, the counties of Leise &amp; Ophalie, called the kings and qu&eacute;enes
counties: these two latelie so named by parlement, in the reignes of Philip and
Marie, hauing shire townes accordant, Philips towne, and Marie bourgh. Connaght
hath the countie Clare: Vlster the counties of Louth, Doune, Antrim, one
moitie of the towne of Droghedagh (for the rest is in M&eacute;eth) and Carregfergus.
In Mounster lie the counties of Waterford, Limerike, Corke, the countie palantine
of Tipperarie, Kerie, &amp; the crosse of Tipperarie. Mounster was of old time diuided
into east Mounster, Ormond, west Mounster, Desmond, south Mounster, Toonmound.
The occasion why Ireland was parted into these fiue principall regions
grew of this. There arriued in Ireland fine brethren, that were valiant &amp; martiall
<note place="marg"><emph>An. mun.</emph> 2533.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Cambrens. lib.</emph> 1. <emph>dist.</emph> 3; <emph>rub.</emph> 5 &amp; 6.</note>
gentlemen; to wit, Gandius, Genandius, Sagandus, otherwise named Gangandus,
Rutheragus or Rutheranus, &amp; Slanius. These fiue perceiuing that the countrie was
not sufficientlie peopled, were agreed (as it were) to cast lots, and to share the
whole realme betw&eacute;ene themselues. The foure elder brethren seuering the countrie
into foure parts, and being loth to vse their yoongest brother like an outcast or
stepsonne, condescended that each of them foure should of their owne portion allot
to Slanius a paring or parcell of their inheritance. Which being as heartilie
receiued of Slanius, as it was bountifullie granted by them, he setled himselfe
therein, and of that partition it tooke the appellation of Media, M&eacute;eth. The foure
<note place="marg">M&eacute;eth whense it is named.</note>
parts m&eacute;et at a certeine stone at M&eacute;eth, n&eacute;ere the castell of Kilaire, as an indifferent
meare to seuer the foure regions.</p>
<p>But although Slanius in the beginning had the least parcell, yet in short space
he stood so well to his tacklings, and incroched so far vpon his neighbors, that he
obteined the whole monarchie of Ireland. At which time he did not suppresse
<note place="marg">M&eacute;eth appointed for the king his table.</note>
in obliuion his inheritance of Meeth; but did inlarge it, and decr&eacute;ed it should be
a countrie appendant to the monarch his diet or table. And albeit the confines
thereof were by Slanius stretched, yet it conteineth not so much land as anie of
the other foure parts comprehendeth; but rather by indifferent surueie, the halfe
deale, whereof also it is not vnlikelie named M&eacute;eth. For whereas in the time of
Slanius, each of the foure parts compriseth two and thirtie cantreds, Meeth conteineth
but sixteene cantreds. A cantred is named so much land as conteineth an
<note place="marg">Cantred.</note>
hundred towneships. This Slanius is intoomed at an hill in M&eacute;eth, which of him is
named Slane. There hath b&eacute;ene in ancient time one Galfride Geneuile, lord of
<note place="marg">Slane.</note>

<note place="marg">Galfride Geneuile.</note>
the libertie of Meeth. This noble man became a frier preacher, and decesed in the
yeare of our Lord 1314, the twentith of October, and was intoomed in the abbcie
of the Black friers at Trim.</p>
<p>There is also another diuision of Ireland, into the English pale, and Irishrie.
<note place="marg">The English pale.</note>
For when Ireland was subdued by the English, diuerse of the conquerors planted
themselues n&eacute;ere to Dublin, and the confines thereto adioining, and so as it were
inclosing and impaling themselues within certeine lists and territories, they feazed
awaie the Irish; insomuch as that countrie became m&eacute;ere English, and thereof it
was termed the English pale: which in ancient time stretched from Dundalke to
Catherlagh or Kilkennie. But now what for the slacknesse of marchours, and
incroching of the Irish enimie, the scope of the English pale is greatlie impaired,
&amp; is cramperned and coucht into an od corner of the countrie named Fingall, with
a parcell of the king his land, M&eacute;eth, the countries of Kildare and Louth, which
parts are applied chieflie with good husbandrie, and taken for the richest and

ciuilest soiles in Ireland. But Fingall especiallie from time to time hath bin so
<note place="marg">Fingula excelleth in husbandrie.</note>
addicted to all the points of husbandrie, as that they are nickenamed by their
neighbours, for their continuall drudgerie, Collonnes, of the Latine word Coloni,
<note place="marg">Collonnes of Fingall.</note>

<note place="marg">Clowne.</note>
wherevnto the clipt English word clowne seemeth to be answerable.</p>
<p>The word Fingall counteruaileth in English the race or sept of the English or
<note place="marg">Fingall, why so named.</note>
estrangers, for that they were solie seized of that part of the Iland, griping with
their talants so firmelie that warme nest, that from the conquest to this daie the
Irish enimie could neuer rouse them from thense. The inhabitants of the English
pale haue b&eacute;ene in old time so much addicted to their ciuilitie, and so farre sequestered
from barbarous sauagenesse, as their onelie mother toong was English. And
<note place="marg">The ciuilitie of Ireland in ancient time.</note>
trulie, so long as these impaled dwellers did sunder themselues as well in land as in
language from the Irish: rudenesse was daie by daie in the countrie supplanted,
ciuilitie ingraffed, good lawes established, loialtie obserued, rebellion suppressed,
and in fine the coine of a yoong England was like to shoot in Ireland. But when
their posteritie became not altogither so warie in k&eacute;eping, as their ancestors were
valiant in conquering, the Irish language was fr&eacute;e dennized in the English pale:
this canker tooke such d&eacute;epe root, as the bodie that before was whole and sound,
was by little and little festered, and in manner wholie putrified. And not onlie
this parcell of Ireland grew to that ciuilitie, but also Vlster and the greater part of
Mounster, as by the sequele of the Irish historie shall plainlie app&eacute;ere. But of all
other places, Weisford with the territorie baied and perclosed within the riuer called
<note place="marg">Weisford wholie English.</note>

<note place="marg">The Pill.</note>
the Pill, was so quite estranged from Irishrie, as if a traueller of the Irish, (which

Weisfordians would command him foorthwith to turne the other end of his toong
and speake English, or els bring his trouchman with him. But in our daies they
haue so acquainted themselues with the Irish, as they haue made a mingle mangle
or gallimaufreie of both the languages, and haue in such medleie or checkerwise
so crabbedlie iumbled them both togither, as commonlie the inhabitants of the
meaner sort speake neither good English nor good Irish.</p>
<p>There was of late daies one of the peeres of England sent to Weisford as commissioner,
<note place="marg">The saieng of a noble man touching the English of Weisford.</note>
to decide the controuersies of that countrie; and hearing in affable wise
the rude complaints of the countrie clowns, he conceined here &amp; there some time a

comming to Ireland, he vnderstood so manie words, told one of his familiar friends,
that he stood in verie great hope to become shortlie a well spoken man in the
Irish, supposing that the blunt people had pratled Irish, all the while they iangled
English. Howbeit to this daie, the dregs of the old ancient Chaucer English are

if they could be weaned from that corrupt custome, there is none that could dislike
of their English.</p>
<p>Here percase some snappish carper will take me at rebound, and snuffinglie snib
me for debasing the Irish language: but trulie, whosoeuer shall be found so ouerthwartlie
bent, he takes the matter farre awrie. For as my skill is verie simple
therein, so I would be loth to disueile my rashnes, in giuing light verdict in anie
thing to me vnknowen: but onelie my short discourse tendeth to this drift, that it
is not expedient that the Irish toong should be so vniuersallie gagled in the English
pale: because that by proofe and experience we s&eacute;e, that the pale was neuer in
more florishing estate than when it was wholie English, and neuer in woorsse
plight than since it hath infranchised the Irish. But some will saie, that I shew
my selfe herein as friuolous as some loosing gamsters s&eacute;eme superstitious, when
<note place="marg">The superstition of gamsters.</note>
they plaie themselues drie, they gogle with their eies hither and thither, and if
they can prie out anie one that giueth them the gaze, they stand lumping and
lowring, fretting and fuming, for that they imagine that all their euill lucke proc&eacute;eded
of him: and yet if the stander by depart, the looser may be found as drie
shauen as he was before. And euen so it fareth with you, because you s&eacute;e all
things run to ruine in the English pale, by reason of great enormities in the
countrie, either openlie practised, or couertlie winked at; you glanse your eie on
that which standeth next you, &amp; by beating Jacke for Gill, you impute the fault
to that which perhaps would little further the weale publike if it were exiled. Now
trulie you shoot verie n&eacute;ere the marke. But if I may craue your patience till time
you s&eacute;e me shoot my bolt, I hope you will not denie, but that as n&eacute;ere the pricke
as you are, and as verie an hagler as I am, yet the scantling shall be mine. First
therefore take this with you, that a conquest draweth, or at the leastwise ought to
draw to it thr&eacute;e things, to wit, law, apparell, and language. For where the
<note place="marg">A conquest implieth three things.</note>
countrie is subdued, there the inhabitants ought to be ruled by the same law that
the conqueror is gouerned, to weare the same fashion of attire wherwith the victor
is vested, and speake the same language that the vanquisher parleth. And if anie
of these thr&eacute;e lacke, doubtlesse the conquest limpeth. Now whereas Ireland hath
bin by lawfull conquest brought vnder the subiection of England, not onelie in king
Henrie the second his reigne, but also as well before as after (as by the discourse
of the Irish historie shall euidentlie be deciphered) and the conquest hath b&eacute;ene so
absolute and perfect, that all Leinster, Meth, Vlster, the more part of Connagh
and Mounster, all the ciuities and burroughs in Ireland haue b&eacute;ene wholie
Englished, and with English conquerors inhabited, is it decent (thinke you) that
their owne ancient natiue toong shall be shrowded in obliuion, and suffer the
enimies language, as it were a tettar or ringworme, to harbor it selfe within the
iawes of English conquerors? No trulie.</p>
<p>And now that I haue fallen vnawares into this discourse, it will not be farre
amisse to stand somewhat roundlie vpon this point. It is knowen, and by the
historie you may in part perceiue, how brauelie Vlster whilom florished. The
English families were there implanted, the Irish either vtterlie expelled or wholie
subdued, the laws dulie executed, the reuenue great, and onelie English spoken.
But what brought it to this present ruine and decaie? I doubt not but you gesse
before I tell you. They were inuironed and compassed with euill neighbours.
Neighbourhood bred acquaintance, acquaintance waffed in the Irish toong, the
Irish hooked with it attire, attire haled rudenesse, rudenesse ingendered ignorance,
ignorance brought contempt of lawes, the contempt of lawes bred rebellion, rebellion
raked thereto warres, and so consequentlie the vtter decaie and desolation of
that worthie countrie. If these chinks, when first they began to chap, had beene

should not haue b&eacute;ene occasioned to dam vp with manie thousand pounds, yea and
with the worthie carcases of valiant souldiors, the gaps of that rebellious northerne
countrie.</p>
<p>Now put the case that the Irish toong were as sacred as the Hebrue, as learned
as the Gr&eacute;eke, as fluent as the Latine, as amarous as the Italian, as courteous as
the Spanish, as courtlike as the French; yet trulie (I know not which waie it falleth
out) I s&eacute;e not but it may be verie well spared in the English pale. And if reason
will not lead you to thinke it, trulie experience must force you to grant it.</p>
<p>In old time, when the Romans were first acquainted with the Gr&eacute;eke toong, as it
is commonlie the nature of man to be delighted with newfangle wares: so he was
accounted no gallant among the Romans, that could not pratle and chat Gr&eacute;eke.
Marcus Cicero father to Tullie, being at that time stept in yeares, perceiuing his
<note place="marg"><emph>Cic. lib.</emph> 2. <emph>de orat.</emph></note>
countrimen to become changelings, in being bilwise and polmad, and to sucke
with the Gr&eacute;eke the conditions of the Grecians, as to be in words talkatine, in behauiour
light, in conditions quaint, in manners hautie, in promises vnstedfast, in
oths rash, in bargains wauering (which were reckoned for Gr&eacute;ekish properties in
those daies) the old gentleman not so much respecting the neatnesse of the language,
as the naughtie fruit it brought with it; said, that his countrimen the
Romans resembled the bondslaues of Siria; for the more perfect they were in the
Greeke, the worse they were in their manners and life. If this gentleman had
b&eacute;ene now liuing, and had s&eacute;ene what alteration hath happened in Ireland, through
the intercourse of languages, he would (I dare saie) breake patience, and would
demand whie the English pale is more giuen to learne the Irish, than the Irishman
is willing to learne English: we must imbrace their language, and they detest
ours. One demanded merilie whie Oneile that last was would not frame himselfe
<note place="marg">Oneile whie he would not learne English.</note>
to speake English? What (quoth the other) in a rage, thinkest thou that it
standeth with Oneile his honor to writh his mouth in clattering English? and yet
forsooth we must gag our iawes in gibbrishing Irish? But I dwell too long in so
apparent a matter. As all the ciuities &amp; towns in Ireland, with Fingall the king
his land, Meth, the countie of Kildare, Louth, Weisford, speake to this daie
English. (whereby the simplicitie of some is to be derided, that iudge the inhabitants
of the English pale, vpon their first repaire into England, to learne their English
in three or foure daies, as though they had bought at Chester a grotes worth of
English, and so packt vp the rest to be carried after them to London) euen so in all
other places their natiue language is Irish.</p>
<p>I find it solemnlie aduouched, aswell in some of the Irish pamphlets as in Girald.

for that it is compounded of all languages. But considering the course of interchanging
and blending of speeches togither, not by inuention of art, but by vse of
talke, I am rather led to bel&eacute;eue (s&eacute;eing Ireland was inhabited within one yeare

phrase, Commestato, that is, How doo you? or how fareth it with you? It fetcheth
sundrie words from the Latine, as arget of <emph>Argentum,</emph> monie; salle of <emph>s&oelig;l,</emph> salt;
cappoulle of <emph>Caballus,</emph> a plough horsse, or (according vnto the old English terme) a
caball or caple: birreat of the old motheaten Latine word <emph>Birretum,</emph> a bonnet. The
toong is sharpe and sententious, &amp; offereth great occasion to quicke apophthegms
and proper allusions. Wherefore their common iesters and rimers, whom they
terme Bards, are said to delight passinglie these that conceiue the grace and propertie
<note place="marg">Bards.</note>

commonlie speake, that scarse one in flue hundred can either read, write, or vnderstand

And in verie d&eacute;ed the language carrieth such difficultie with it, what for the
<note place="marg">The difficultie.</note>
strangenesse of the phrase, and the curious featnes of the pronuntiation, that a verie
few of the countrie can atteine to the perfection thereof, and much lesse a forrener
or stranger.</p>
<p>A gentleman of mine acquaintance reported, that he did see a woman in Rome,
which was possessed with a babling spirit, that could haue chatted anie language
sauing the Irish: and that it was so difficult, as the verie diuell was grauelled
therewith. A gentleman that stood by answered, that he tooke the speech to be so
sacred and holie, that no damned f&eacute;end had the power to speake it; no more than
they are able to saie (as the report goeth) the verse of saint John the euangelist, "Et
<note place="marg"><emph>John</emph> 1. <emph>verse</emph> 14.</note>
verbum caro factum est." Naie by God his mercie man (quoth the other) I stand in
doubt (I tell you) whether the apostles in their copious mart of languages at Jerusalem
could haue spoken Irish, if they were apposed: whereat the companie heartilie
laughed. As fluent as the Irish toong is, yet it lacketh diuerse words, and borroweth
them verbatim of the English. As there is no vulgar Irish word (vnlesse
there be some od terme that lurketh in anie obscure shrowds or other of their
<note place="marg">The want of the Irish.</note>
storehouse) for a cote, a gowne, a dublet, an hat, a drinking cup: but onelie they
vse the same words with a little inflexion. They vse also the contracted English
phrase, God morrow, that is to saie, God giue you a good morning.</p>
<p>I haue apposed sundrie times the expertest men that could be had in the countrie,
and all they could neuer find out an equiualent Irish word for knaue. The Grecians
<note place="marg">No Irish word for knaue.</note>
(according to Tullie his iudgement) were in the same predicament as touching the
terme <emph>Ineptus</emph>: his words are these. "Ego mehercul&eacute; ex omnibus Latinis verbis,

<p>Certes I haue b&eacute;ene of opinion (saith Tullie) that amongest the whole crue of
Latine terms the word <emph>Ineptus</emph> hath b&eacute;ene of greatest importance or weight. For
he, whom we name <emph>Ineptus,</emph> seemeth to me to haue the etymologie or ofspring of
his name here hense deriued, that he is not apt; which stretcheth far and wide in
the vsuall custome of our dailie sp&eacute;ech or communication. For he that dooth not
perceiue what is fitting or decent for euerie season, or gableth more than he hath
commission to doo, or that in bragging, bosting, or peacockwise setteth himselfe
foorth to the gaze, by making more of the broth, than the flesh is worth; or he
that regardeth not the vocation and aftaires of them, with whome he intermedleth:
or in fine, who so is stale without grace, or ouer tedious in anie matter, he is

tearmed <emph>Ineptus</emph>; which is asmuch in English, in my phantasie, as saucie, or malapert.
The famous &amp; learned Gr&eacute;eke nation is generallie dusked with this fault.
And for that the Grecians could not spie the enormitie thereof, they haue not so
<note place="marg">Saucines.</note>
much as framed a terme thereto. For if you should ransacke the whole Gr&eacute;eke
language, you shall not find a word to counteruaile <emph>Ineptus.</emph> Thus far Tullie. Yet
Bud&aelig;us would not s&eacute;eme to acknowledge this barrennesse, but that the Gr&eacute;eke
word <foreign lang="greek">a\peir|o\xalos</foreign> is equiposlent to <emph>Ineptus</emph>: but that I referre to the iudgement of the
learned, being verie willing to find out some other Bud&aelig;us, that could fashion an
Irish word for knaue, whereof this discourse of <emph>Ineptus</emph> grew. As the whole realme
<note place="marg"><emph>Bud&oelig;. lib.</emph> 2. <emph>de Asse. &amp; part. ciue.</emph></note>
of Ireland is sundred into foure principall parts, as before is said, so each parcell
differeth verie much in the Irish toong, euerie countrie hauing his dialect, or peculiar
maner in speaking the language: therefore commonlie in Ireland they ascribe
a propertie to each of the foure countries in this sort. Vlster hath the right Irish
phrase, but not the true pronunciation; Munster hath the true pronunciation, but
not the phrase; Leinster is deuoid of the right phrase, and true pronunciation;
Connaght hath both the right phrase and true pronunciation. There is a cholerike
or disdainfull interiection vsed in the Irish language called Boagh, which is
<note place="marg">Irish boagh.</note>
as much in English as twish. The Irish both in ancient time and to this daie commonlie
vse it, and therefore the English conquerors called them Irish poghes, or

them of the English pale. The English interiection, Fough, which is vsed in

<p>The aire is verie holesome, not generallie so cleare and subtill as that of England.
The weather is more temperat, being not so warme in summer, nor cold in winter,

opinion of some writers, who both in this and other errors, touching this countrie,

<note place="marg">The controuersie of the Ile of Man decided.</note>

Orchades are adiudged to be appendant to Ireland, because those Ilands, neither
br&eacute;ed nor foster anie venemous worme, as Hector Boetius auoucheth. Giraldus
Cambrensis writeth that he heard certeine merchants affirme, that when they had
vnladen their ships in Ireland they found by hap some toads vnder their balast.
And they had no sooner cast them on the shore, than they would puffe and swell
vnmeasurablie, &amp; shortlie after turning vp their bellies, they would burst in sunder.
And not onelie the earth and dust of Ireland, but also the verie thongs of Irish
leather haue the verie same force and vertue. I haue s&eacute;ene it, saith Cambrensis,
<note place="marg"><emph>Cam. ibid. rub.</emph> 30. 31.</note>
experimented, that a toad being incompassed with a thong of Irish leather, and
cr&eacute;eping thitherward, indeuoring to haue skipt ouer it, suddenlie reculed backe, as
<note place="marg">Irish leather expelleth venemous wormes.</note>
though it had b&eacute;ene rapt in the head: wherevpon it began to sprall to the other
side. But at length perceiuing that the thong did embaie it of all parts, it began
to thirle, and as it were to dig the earth, where finding an hole, it slunke awaie in
the presence of sundrie persons.</p>
<p>It happened also in my time, saith Giraldus Cambrensis, that in the north of
<note place="marg"><emph>Cambr. in codem loco.</emph></note>
England a knot of yongkers tooke a nap in the fields: as one of them laie snorting
with his mouth gaping, as though he would haue caught flies, it happened that a
snake or adder slipt into his mouth, and glided downe into his bellie, where harboring
it selfe, it began to roame vp and downe, and to f&eacute;ede on the yoong man his
entrals. The patient being sore distracted and aboue measure tormented with the
biting pangs of this gr&eacute;edie ghest, incessantlie praied to God, that if it stood with
his gratious will, either wholie to bereaue him of his life, or else of his vnspeakeable
mercie to ease him of his paine. The worme would neuer ceasse from gnawing the
patient his carcasse, but when he had taken his repast, and his meat was no sooner
digested, than it would giue a fresh onset in boring his guts. Diuerse remedies
were sought, and medicins, pilgrimages to saints, but all could not preuaile. Being
at length schooled by the graue aduise of some sage and expert father, that willed
him to make his sp&eacute;edie repaire to Ireland, would tract no time, but busked himselfe
ouer sea, and arriued in Ireland. He did no sooner drinke of the water of that

slanderouslie than pithilie had busied himselfe therein. Wherefore, sith I may with

<p>"I will begin (saith Iren&aelig;us) with saint Paule. You know that in Melita (which
at this daie is called Malta) saint Paule flung into the fire a viper that stucke or did
cleaue to his hand. In that Iland scorpions which are elsewhere deadlie or venemous,
are become through the gift of saint Paule (as it is supposed) harmelesse.</p>
<p>"Tush (quoth Critobulus) that may be percase incident to the nature of the soile.</p>
<p>"Naie then (replieth Iren&aelig;us) you are in a wrong box. For the Ilanders (as
saint Luke mentioneth) showted, that a parentquellor was brought thither, and
because he was not swallowed in the gulfes of the sea, the gods being in their fustian
fumes, sent serpents to slaie him. And they looked for nothing sooner than to see
him euen at a twinkling to perish. But when they perceiued him to be so farre
distant from death, as that he susteined no harme, ne felt anie paine, the people
therewith amazed, said he far surpassed mans estate, &amp; that he was a god inuested
in man his shape.</p>
<p>"You haue reason (answereth Critobulus) you haue hit the naile on the head.</p>
<p>"Yea but I praie you clip not my tale (saith Iren&aelig;us) but take me with you.
Stones are culled in the caue or den wherein saint Paule is said to haue baited or
soiorned, which stones in maner in all Europe are souereigne medicines to cure the
bitings and stinges of scorpions and serpents. Furthermore, they that are borne
the fiue and twentith of Januarie (which daie is named the conuersion of S. Paule)
in what part soeuer of the world they are borne, they feare not or grudge not at
snakes: yea, that which is more to be admired, the stingings of poisoned worms
are healed by the verie spittle of this Januarie brood. Which thing hath b&eacute;ene of
late published by a well lettered man Thomas Fazellus, to haue b&eacute;ene curiouslie
noted of him, as well by proofe and experience, as by sure and substantiall
examples, if I take not the matter amisse.</p>
<p>"Then commeth in Critobulus, whome maister Cope maketh (I will not saie the
vice or hicscorner) but the plesant conceipted gentleman of this enterlude, and
fetcheth a long leape (for I am sure he could not iumpe so farre) from Malta to
Ireland, and frameth his tale in this sort. By the faith of my bodie sir, here is
stuffe woorth the noting. And now I call to mind, that I haue read and often
heard, that the like benefit hath b&eacute;ene imparted to Ireland, through the praiers of
saint Patrike the apostle of the said Iland, that is to saie, that Ireland breedeth no
venemous worme. And therevpon percase some are accustomed to saie, that there
is no poisoned or venemous thing in Ireland, but onelie the people, which is taken
to haue beene said of most men for their brutish and sauage maners.</p>
<p>"To this (saith Iren&aelig;us) I am doone to vnderstand by the report of diuerse,
and also by Bede, that no poisoned or venemous thing is bred in that realme: in
somuch that the verie earth of that countrie being brought into other realmes,
killeth all venemous and poisoned wormes." But let the matter fall out which waie
<note place="marg">Judgement.</note>
it will; I ascribe that propertie not to saint Patrike, but to the nature of the soile,
because it hath b&eacute;en knowen long before saint Patrike was borne, that Ireland was
indued with that propertie, which is elsewhere easie to be found. Hitherto Maister
Cope.</p>
<p>In this discourse (gentle reader) thou seest that Maister Cope handleth two principall
points, the propertie of Malta, and the nature of Ireland in destroieng venemous
worms, the one he ascribeth to the blessed apostle saint Paule, the other he
will not in anie wise impute to saint Patrike. Touching the first, as I have no occasion
to intermeddle therein, so I purpose not for the quarell I haue to the person, to
disproove his opinion so farre as it standeth with truth. Wherefore that God that

(<emph>e</emph>) Tabitha; yea with his verie (<emph>f</emph>) shadow to cure the sicke; and the God that
gaue to that Paule, of whome maister Cope speaketh, his gratious gift to make the
(<emph>g</emph>) lame go; to (<emph>h</emph>) quicken and raise the deceased, and for his sake to (<emph>i</emph>) salue
his fellow passengers: it is not to be denied, but that God would impart his goodnes
to anie region, euen the sooner that any of his blessed seruants would harborough
there. And as I doubt not but Simon the tanners house was nothing the
woorse for lodging so happie a ghest as Peter: so I am sure Malta was farre the
better for harboring so blessed a traueller or passenger as Paule. Which S. Luke
letteth not to sell, declaring that all they which were sicke in the Iland, flocked to
Paule, and were cured; and also the patient that was father to Publius, in whose
house they were thr&eacute;e daies, verie courteouslie interteined, was by S. Paule healed.
Which cure as well of that patient, as of the residue of the Ilanders, did not onlie
extend to their bodies, but ch&eacute;eflie &amp; especiallie to their soules, according to the
opinion of the learned diuines. For as our sauior Iesus Christ was neuer thought to cure
<note place="marg"><emph>Augu. tract</emph> 30 <emph>in Iohan. Th. p.</emph> 3 <emph>q.</emph> 44. <emph>a.</emph> 3 <emph>ad.</emph> 3 <emph>m.</emph></note>
anie ones bodie, but he would also heale his soule: so it must be thought of his
apostles, in whose steps both in life and miracles they traced. And therfore the learned
hold opinion, that S. Paule being in Malta expelled from diuerse of their soules the
old serpent that deceiued our progenitors Adam and Eue; for which God is to be
<note place="marg"><emph>Gen.</emph> 3 <emph>vers.</emph> 13.</note>
magnified and glorified. Thus much I thought good here to insert, as a clause not
wholie swaruing from that we treat of, and also that I would be found prest and
readie, as farre as my simple skill stretcheth, to vnderstand anie opinion that tendeth
to the honor and glorie of God.</p>
<p>Howbeit forsomuch as M. Cope hath so strictlie dealt with Ireland, as with a
countrie nothing apperteining to this matter, I trust he will pardon me, to be somewhat
bold with him, touching the historie of Malta, that as his negligence shall be
in the one disshrowed, so his slanderous iudgement maie be in the other reuersed.
First therfore where he writeth, that the inhabitants of Malta <emph>Clamabant,</emph> that is,
cried, or showted, it was not so. The Gr&eacute;eke text runneth, <foreign lang="greek">e)/legon pro\s a)llh/lqs</foreign>,
<emph>Dicebant ad inuicem,</emph> that is to saie, they muttered one to an other. And saint Luke
<note place="marg"><emph>Act.</emph> 28. <emph>vers.</emph> 4.</note>
paraphraseth his meaning after. For when they perceiued that the viper did not
annoie Paule, then saith saint Luke, <emph>Conuertentes se, dicebant eum esse deum;</emph> They
turning the one towards the other, whispered or muttered that Paule was a god.
Now put the case they cried, as M. Cope saith, is it like that Paule was so
<note place="marg">Saint Paule heard not the inhabitants of Malta.</note>
busie in making of a fire, or that his eares did wander so farre off, as that he could
not heare them? And if he heard them, thinke you that he would haue beene
whist, in hearing God so farre blasphemed, as that he would suffer himselfe to be
defied? No trulie. He would haue taken on, as he and Barnabas did at Listris,
<note place="marg"><emph>Act.</emph> 14. <emph>vers.</emph> 11, 12, 13, 14.</note>
where the inhabitants named them gods, Barnabas to be Iupiter, and Paule, for
that he was well spoken, to be Mercurie. For when the apostles heard of their
idolatrie, renting their clothes, they rusht into the throng, crieng and speaking,
that they were mortall men, &amp;c. In which place S. Luke putteth an expresse difference
as it were of set purpose, betw&eacute;ene both the words, <emph>Clamantes &amp; dicentes.</emph>
M. Cope addeth further, <emph>Delatum e&ograve; parricidam,</emph> and yet the Gr&eacute;eke hath <foreign lang="greek">pa/ntws foneus</foreign>,
<emph>Omnin&ograve; interfector,</emph> or as the vulgar text is, <emph>Vtique bomicida est homo hie.</emph> So that
they tooke him to be but a manquellor, yet M. Cope maketh him a parricide, which
is woorse. For although euerie parricide be a manquellor, yet <emph>E conuerso,</emph> euerie
manquellor is not a parricide.</p>
<p>M. Cope proc&eacute;edeth further, "<emph>Irati dij, serpentes, qui eum tollerent, immisissent:</emph>
The gods being angrie sent serpents to dispatch Paule." And yet forsooth, all
these serpents were but one viper, as is plainelie exprest in the text, vnlesse. M. Cope
would teach saint Luke to tell his tale after the finest fashion, least the apostle should

haue b&eacute;ene thought to haue fitoned. As the parson that preached to his parishoners
<note place="marg">A parson his sermon.</note>
of the gospell, wherein mention is made of them that Christ fed in the desert, or
wildernesse. O (quoth the parson) what a Christ was that, that with fiue barlie
loaues, and fiue fishes fed fiue hundred persons. The clerke hearing his master to
grate ouerlong on that point, for he did often iterate that sentence, stole up to the
pulpit, and plucking the parson by his gowne, whispered in his eare that Christ fed
fiue thousand. Hold thee contented thou foolish fellow (quoth the parson) if I
should tell mine hearers of so great a number, I should but discredit the gospeller,
and they would not bel&eacute;eve me. So it fareth with M. Cope. Belike he mistrusted,
that if he had said, that one viper could haue slaine Paule, the reader would haue
suspected the vntruth of the matter: bicause it carrieth great likelihood with it,
that one man could withstand one viper: and therefore to saue saint Luke his
credit, he increaseth the number by putting the plurall for the singular. Whereas
therefore it standeth with M. Cope his pleasure, to florish in his rhetoricall figure
<note place="marg">M. Cope his rhetorike.</note>
named, <emph>Veritatis superlatio,</emph> in terming muttering, showting, a manquellor, a parricide,
one viper, serpents: he must be borne withall, if in the heat of his figure he
step a little awrie in the remnant of his discourse. For thus he saith.</p>
<p>And therevpon it is reported percase by some men, that there is nothing venemous
or poisoned in Ireland, but the men and women. Which is taken to haue
beene spoken by most men for their brutish and sauage maners. Here (good reader)
thou must vnderstand that M. Cope putteth the text downe and the glose. The
text is, There is nothing in Ireland venemous but the inhabitants. The glose is,
This is said to haue b&eacute;en spoken for their brutish and sauage conditions. Now well
harpt by saint Lankfield. Here is a glose, I vndertake you, sutable to the text.
But let vs s&eacute;e, how cunninglie M. Cope beequiteth himselfe. First he obserueth
not <emph>Decorum person&oelig;,</emph> secondlie he followeth not <emph>Decorum dialogi,</emph> thirdlie he sheweth
herein little diuinitie. Touching the first point, who knoweth not, that these iapes
and gibes are onelie fit for ruffians, vices, swashbucklers &amp; tospots. And trulie they
beeset a diuine as well, as for an asse to twang quipassa on a harpe or gitterne, or
for an ape to friske trenchmoore in a paire of buskins and a doublet. The heathen
<note place="marg"><emph>Cic. lib.</emph> 2. <emph>de orat.</emph></note>
misliked in an orator squirilitie, what should be thought then of a diuine, whome
saint Paule would haue to be sober, modest, graue, and wise? Vnlesse M. Cope
<note place="marg"><emph>Tim.</emph> 3. <emph>vers.</emph> 2. <emph>&amp;</emph> 3.</note>
leaning to the letter of saint Paule his words would beare vs in hand, that saint
Paule would haue modestie to rest onelie in bishops. We are commanded in the
old and new testament, to loue our neighbors as our selues Which dooth implie,
that we ought not to slander our neighbours.</p>
<p>And shall a diuine then speake vncharitablie, not onelie of one, but of an whole
realme, and not onelie speake but also write, yea and that in the language that is
vniuersallie spoken, thoroughout the greater part of the world, vpon no sure ground,
but onelie vpon hearesaie, weieng not what the prophet writeth, <emph>Perdes omnes qui

it that anie such flim flam flirts were soothed by anie person of credit; yet (as me
seemeth) it would stand more with the grauitie of a diuine, than such childish quips,
and scornefull tawnts should sooner by his meanes charitablie be whisted, than
thorough his procurement carpinglie published. I will stand no longer on this
<note place="marg"><emph>Mattb.</emph> 5. <emph>vers.</emph> 22.</note>
point, but onelie craue M. Cope to resort to the fift of Matthew, and there peruse
Christ his verdict touching slanderous toongs. To come to the seeond part, in
which he obserueth not <emph>Decorum dialogi,</emph> thou shalt vnderstand (good reader) that
Critabulus, or Critobulus, whome M. Cope maketh his bagpipe to belch out his
rancour, is a Germane borne, as M. Cope saith, who s&eacute;emeth to be Critabulus
his godfather. Now let anie one, that is acquainted with the maners of Germans,
iudge, if it be decent, that one of them should scoffe and scorne the conditions and

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"fashions"</fw>-->


<pb n="14"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"14"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE DESCRIPTION OF IRELAND."</fw>-->


fashions of other countries. I will not speake by heare saie, as M. Cope dooth, but
by eiesight. I could neuer espie nor probablie haue I heard it reported, no not of
the m&eacute;ere sauage Irish, such quaffing, such swilling, such bolling, such gulling,
such brutish drunkennesse, such surfetting, such vomitting, as I haue seene some
Germans doo. In good sooth it is knowne, and for my part I haue seene it being
<note place="marg">The German his friendship.</note>
beyond the seas, that in their carowsing and cup friendship, they threaten such
kindnesse on their companions, that least their felowes should mistrust them with
double dealing, they will not sticke to shew them the bottome of their stomachs; &amp;
to the end they should take the better view thereof, they will place it now and
then in their neighbors bosome.</p>
<p>Thus when they haue cast their gorges, they clap on their thrumd hats, and run
like bedlem barretors into the str&eacute;ets with their naked flatchets, and there they
keepe such a stinking sturre with hacking of stones, with hewing of blocks, with
thwitting of stocks, with striking of stalles, with thumping at doores, that it would
make a horsse breake his halter, to see so drunken a pageant. In fine, this qualitie
is so naturallie ingraffed in the greater part of them, that a famous diuine did not
sticke of late to saie openlie in his lecture, than drunkennesse in that countrie man,
was either <emph>Peccatum originale</emph> or <emph>Accidens inseparabile.</emph> I write not this (I take God
to record) to the reproch or slander of that countrie (being loth to commit the selfe
same fault that I reprehend in anie other) but onelie my meaning is to settle before
the reader his eies the absurditie of M. Cope, in framing poore Critabolus to flout
Ireland, considering that if he cast his eie homeward, he shall find as filthie puddle
in his owne countrie, as in other realms. And therefore this quip sat as vnseemlie
in his mouth, as for an whoore to reprehend bitcherie, or for an vsurer to condemne
simonie. For as there is nothing lesse to be tollerated, than for anie one to haue
an other to account for his life, that can yeeld no account of his owne: so there is
nothing that ought to moozzell vp anie one from rebuking other nations, than to
s&eacute;e the misdemeanor of his owne natiue countrie. I would wish M. Critabolus or
M. Cope, if it shall please him to make vp the muster, with indifferencie to weie
the estate of Ireland, and so without parcialitie to frame his iudgement.</p>
<p>Ireland, and especiallie the ruder part is not stored with such learned men as
<note place="marg">Ireland how it maie be reformed.</note>
Germanie is. If they had sound preachers, and sincere liuers, that by the imbalming
of their carian soules with the sw&eacute;et and sacred flowers of holie writ, would instruct
them in the feare of God, in obeieng their prince, in obseruing the lawes, in vnderpropping
in ech man his vocation the weale publike; I doubt not, but within two
or thr&eacute;e ages M. Critabolus his heires should heare so good a report run of the
reformation of Ireland, as it would be reckoned as ciuill as the best part of Germanie.
Let the soile be as fertile and betle as anie would wish, yet if the husbandman
will not manure it, sometime plow and eare it, sometime harrow it, sometime
till it, sometime marle it, sometime delue it, sometime dig it, and sow it with good
and sound corne, it will bring foorth w&eacute;eds, bindcorne, cockle, darnell, brambles,
briers, and sundrie wild shoots. So it fareth with the rude inhabitants of Ireland,
they lacke vniuersities, they want instructors, they are destitute of teachers, they
are without preachers, they are deuoid of all such necessaries as apperteine to the
training vp of youth: and notwithstanding all these wants, if anie would be so
frowardlie set, as to require them, to vse such ciuilitie, as other regions, that are
sufficientlie furnished with the like helps; he might be accounted as vnreasonable,
as he that would force a cr&eacute;eple that lacketh both his legs to run, or one to pipe or
whistle a galiard that wanteth his vpper lip.</p>
<p>But such is the corrupt nature of vs worldlings, and me thinketh such vaine
humors are not vtterlie dried vp in our sage and mortified diuines. We are most
commonlie giuen rather to tawnt that which is amisse, than to praise that which is

good; and rather we follow the spider in soking the poison, than in imitating the
b&eacute;e by sucking the honie. Now that it appeareth, that it was not fitting for the
author being a diuine, to write so vncharitablie, nor for M. Critabolus being a
Germane to carpe other countries so snappishlie: let vs see what wholesome diviaitie
hath beene here vttered, and how well the sinewes of M. Critabolus his argument
shall be found to hang togither, when the anatomie therof by peecemeale
shall be examined. I call to mind (quoth M. Critabolus) that I have read and
often heard, that the like benefit hath b&eacute;ene granted to Ireland through the praiers
of S. Patrike. M. Critabolus read &amp; heard that by the praiers of S. Patrike, Ireland
hath no venemous worme: <emph>Ergo</emph> some hold opinion, that the poison resteth onlie in
the people. Truly this argument hangeth togither by verie strange gimbols. And
I dare say, M. Cope neuer learned this kind of reasoning in the famous college of
Magdalene in Oxford, whatsoeuer M. Critabulus did in Germanie. But let
vs put the logike apart, &amp; scan the singular point of diuinitie. I would gladlie
lerne in what part of scripture or in what ancient father M. Critabulus read or heard
(for most of his learning hath beene, as it seemeth, purchased by heare-saie) that
anie holie prelat, that came of meere charitie to conuert a countrie from night to
light, from rudenesse to knowledge, from infidelitie to christianitie, from vice
to vertue, from the diuell to God (which dooth implie an especiall zeale in saluing
their soules) would purge the soile of all venemous wormes, &amp; leaue the soules that
haue more n&eacute;ed to be w&eacute;eded, wholie infected with the contagion of vice and sinne.
Wherby insueth that the place is better than the inhabitants, and so consequentlie

<note place="marg"><emph>Luc.</emph> 8. <emph>ver.</emph> 32.</note>
the patient of the legion of diuels, permitted them to enter into an heard of hogs.
Critabulus would haue Christs saints doo the contrarie, to dispossesse the hogs,
and to leaue the men possessed with diuels. For so he reporteth saint Patrike to
haue doone, by ridding the land of all poisoned wormes, &amp; leauing the rancour to
lurke in the people. Trulie if the matter stood so farre out of ioint, I doubt not,
but the Ilanders might haue come as lawfullie to him, as the Gergesens came
<note place="marg"><emph>Luc.</emph> 2. <emph>ver.</emph> 37.</note>
ingratefullie to Christ, requiring him to depart their countrie. For such a scoffing
prelat, his roome had b&eacute;ene better than his companie, sith his abode would tend
rather to the peruerting, than the conuerting of their Iland.</p>
<p>Hitherto thou hast heard (gentle reader) how gallantlie Critabulus hath plaied his
part: now shall I desire th&eacute;e to view how sagelie Ireneus claspeth up all the whole
controuersie. He saith it is the nature of the soile, not to breed anie venemous
worme, and that was incident thereto before saint Patrike was borne. How prooue
you that sir? Pleaseth you to skew your eie towards the margent, and there shall
you find the fiue and thirtith chapter of Solinus solemnlie quoted. Touching this
matter, there is nothing in Solinus but this; <emph>Illic anguis nullus, auis rara,</emph> In Ireland
is no snake, and seldome a bird, &amp; yet birds are as commonlie there as in anie
other countrie. But I would gladlie vnderstand how this authoritie of Solinus
furthereth M. Ireneus his opinion. Ireland bred no snake before saint Patrike was
borne. <emph>Ergo</emph> it ingendred no toad, no adder, no frog, nor anie other virulent
worme. As if a man would reason thus: Before saint Patrike his time there was no
horssemill in Ireland: <emph>Ergo</emph> before his time there was no milhorsse. Certes he that
would wind vp his conclusion so fondlie, might be thought to haue as much wit as
a rosted horse. This authoritie of Solinus is so far from vpholding Ireneus his assertion,
as that it plainelie s&eacute;emeth quite to ouerthrow it, &amp; as it were in his owne
turne, it giueth him a fall.</p>
<p>For the cause whie saint Patrike was mooued to expell all the venemous wormes

out of Ireland, might probablie haue b&eacute;ene coniectured, to haue proceeded of this;
that he perceiuing the land to br&eacute;ed no snakes, therof was occasioned, for the furthering
of christian faith, to expell other kind of wormes that lurked there before
his comming, as toades, adders, blindworms, frogs, &amp;c. H&eacute;ere perchase M. Cope

may blench me, in replieng that <emph>Anguis</emph> may be construed generallie for all kind of

<p>In

<note place="marg">Answer.</note>
by notifieng a poisoned spider and such like, and in mine opinion further from the

his reason with the old said saw, <emph>Non est bonum ludere cum sanctis,</emph> It is not good,
quoth he, to plaie on sundaies or holie daies. Is it (thinke you) fellonie or treason,
to bring the credit of Solinus in question, for mistaking <emph>Anguis</emph> aswell as <emph>Auis ?</emph> For
as he was groslie deceiued in the one, in writing that birds were rare in Ireland; so
might he haue straied as likelie in the other, by disburdening Ireland of all venemous
wormes, bicause the Iland wanted in his time but one or two kinds, as a snake
and a toad. Where a man buildeth vpon euerie twatling and pratling rumor, and
<note place="marg">Rumor catcheth fethers.</note>
his eie is not his iudge, he may be sure, that such flieng tales will catch manie
feathers before they come at him that is as far distant from their nests, as Solinus
was from Ireland when he wrote his pamphlet. The proofe whereof as it is dailie
tried, so not manie yeares past hath beene verie pretilie verefied. There was a gentleman
of mine acquaintance that met his enimie in the fields, where they both
vpon a trifling quarell fought so fr&eacute;endlie, as they had more n&eacute;ed to haue beene
grapled togither with cables, than parted by indifferent sticklers. Howbeit, bicause
the gentleman was neuer before flesht, and yet nothing at all that daie, for each of
their blowes did commonlie light on the medow where they fought; a friend of his
reported well of him to an other, saieng, that he was like in time to prooue a proper
man of his hands, for the well handling of his weapon in his late combat. Wherevpon
soon after, the other doubling the gentleman his praise, gaue notice to an
other, that such a gentleman (naming him) fought valiantlie such a daie in such a
place. Immediatlie vpon this in a shire or two off, it was noised that the partie
praised, fought with two at once in such a place, naming the medow. At length it
was bruted, that he fought foure seuerall daies; and I am well assured that was the
first fraie that euer he made, and I thinke it will be the last, vnlesse he be forced
maugre his heart to the contrarie.</p>
<p>Not long after it happened, that a gentleman and I trauelled abroad the countrie
of set purpose to disport our selues, and so to returne afresh to our books, where
entering in communication with a blunt countrie lob (yet such an one as tooke his
halfepenie to be good siluer) that knew the foresaid champion. My companion and
I made wise, as though we were not acquainted with him, or euer heard of the
combat: Now in good faith gentleman (quoth he) you would doo verie well to
<note place="marg">A fr&eacute;endlie commendation.</note>
enter in acquaintance with him; for ouer this, that he is a gentleman abundantlie
endued with singular good qualities, he is become of late so valiant a cutter, as he
maketh blading his dailie breakefast. By saint Marie, quoth my companion, that is
verie cold roste, and if his breakefasts be no better than a peece of cold yron, I
little weigh how seldome I take a repast in his companie at anie such ordinarie.
Naie, my meaning is (quoth the other) that he vseth to fight fresh and fasting
euerie morning, in so much that of late, I dare bide by it, he fought eight daies in
one weeke. At which words I for my part could not refraine from laughing, s&eacute;eing
how demurelie the fellow kept his countenance, and how that he spake <emph>Bona fide.</emph>
Wherevpon I shaped him an answer and said, that I neuer heard of anie that fought
eight daies in one weeke, but onelie in old time, when fiue quarters made vp the yeare.</p>

<p>The fellow perceiuing that he ouershot himselfe, replied: Sir, you take me verie
short, as long and as verie a lowbie as you imagine to make me: my meaning is,
that he fought eight seuerall times in one weeke. Eight times (quoth my companion)
then belike he fought once aboue commons. For you told vs right now, that he
made his fraie his morning breakefast, and whereas there are but seauen daies in the
w&eacute;eke, &amp; he fought (as you report) eight times, and you know that eight maketh
one aboue seauen, and seauen maketh six and one vnder eight; either you must
confesse that he fought out his breakfast, dinner, beuer or supper; or else you must
grant that there be eight daies in one w&eacute;eke, or at the least two breakefasts in one
daie: and that I am sure you will confesse to be as great an absurditie as the other.
Naie (quoth the clowne) and you intrap me with such sophistrie, you shall dine,
sup and breake your fast alone for me, and therewithall departed. Wherby may
be gathered, that if he had bin soothed vp, &amp; his toong let run at libertie vncontrold,
like a bowle that runneth in a smooth allie without anie rub, he would haue
brought himselfe to that baie, as he would not sticke to saie that his fr&eacute;end had fought
eight daies in one houre. Wherefore as this pudding his pricke grew at length by
report to an huge post, so the want of one venemous worme in Ireland, being
bruted in forren realmes, might haue beene so thwitted and mangled in the cariage
before it came to Solinus his eares, as he might haue beene informed, that the
countrie was deuoid of all venemous woormes, whereas ind&eacute;ed there lacked but one
kind.</p>
<p>Like as God of his iustice punisheth a countrie that is hardhearted, with outward
wormes: so of his mercie they are remooued from a realme that is pliant to follow
his lawes and precepts. As when Pharao would not listen to God his threats
<note place="marg"><emph>Exod.</emph> 8. <emph>vers.</emph> 7, 17, <emph>&amp;</emph> 24.</note>

denounced him by the preachers of God, Moses and Aaron, Egypt was punished
with frogs and diuerse kind of flies, as is exprest at full in holie writ: and againe
vpon Pharao his feined promises (the secrers of whose hollow heart God perfectlie
knew) at the instance of Moses, these plagues were appeased, and the vermine quite
extinguished: so I praie you, is it so absurd a position to hold, that saint Patrike
finding the Irish priest to embrace the gospell, as he did in verie deed, might stand
so highlie in God his fauor, as through his earnest petition made to God, the poisoned
woormes should be abandoned ? This is not so rare a thing vpon the implanting
of christian faith in anie region, but rather a propertie incident thereto,
according to Christ his promise: "Signa autem eos, qui crediderint, h&aelig;c sequentur;
<note place="marg"><emph>Gregor. bom.</emph> 29. <emph>in euang.</emph></note>
In nomine meo d&aelig;monia eijcient: linguis loquentur nouis: serpentes tollent: &amp; si

they cast out diuels, they shall speake with new toongs, they shall driue awaie
serpents, and if they drinke anie deadlie thing it shall not hurt them: they shall
laie hands on the sicke, and they shall be cured. Wherefore, sith it is so euidentlie
warranted by scripture, that in the name of Iesus, serpents may be driuen awaie, if
Ireland be found through anie such means to be deuoid of poisoned wormes, we
are to ascribe the glorie hereof to God, according to the saieng of the prophet;
"A domino factum est istud, &amp; est mirabile in oculis nostris," That hath b&eacute;ene

expell poisoned wormes out of Ireland, or whether it be the nature of the soile, as
I said in the entrie of this discourse; so I saie againe, that I weigh not two chips

made in mounterbankwise the most he could of his wares. But for that he would
needs s&eacute;e further in a milstone than others, and not onelie slanderlie disprooue the
triuiall opinion, but scornefullie slander an whole realme, wherein he shall find his
superiors in honour, his betters in parentage, his peeres in learning, his mates in
wisdome, his equals in courtesie, his matches in honestie: I must craue him to
beare it patientlie, if by crieng him quittance, I serued him with a dish of his owne
cookerie. And if for this my streict dealing with him (wherevnto I was the sooner
led, for that as it is courtesie to mollifie wild speaches with mild answers, so I

wedges) he will s&eacute;eme to take pepper in the nose, for anie recompense he is like to
haue at mine hands, he may wipe his nose on his sl&eacute;eue. And if it shall stand with
his pleasure, to replie either in English or in Latine (the occasion of which is rather
of him growne than by me giuen) he shall find me willing, if God spare me health,

therefore it is continuallie admired. But for that dame nature the counterfeitresse
of the celestiall workeman, eftsoones br&eacute;edeth barnacles, therefore their brood is

Germiniano accordeth.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Ireland are accustomed to mooue question, whether barnacles
be fish or flesh, &amp; as yet they are not fullie resolued; but most vsuallie the religious
of streictest abstinence doo eat them on fish daies Giraldus Cambrensis, and after
him Polichronicon suppose, that the Irish cleargie in this point straie. For they
hold of certeintie that barnacles are flesh. And if a man saie they had eaten
a collop of Adam his leg, he had eaten flesh. And yet Adam was not ingendred of
mascle or female, but onelie created of claie, as the barnacles of wood &amp; rotten
timber. But the Irish clergie did not so farre straie in their opinion, as Cambrensis
&amp; Polichronicon, in their disproofe. For the framing of Adam and Eue was supernaturall
<note place="marg">Adam &amp; Eue onelie created by God.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>August. super Genes. ad lit. lib.</emph> 9. <emph>c.</emph> 18.</note>
onelie doone by God, &amp; not by the helpe of angels or anie other creature.
For like as it surpasseth natures course to raise the dead, to lighten or insight the
blind, so it stood not with the vsuall &amp; common linage of nature, but onlie with
the supereminent power of God, to frame a man of claie, and a woman of a mans
rib. But the ingendring of barnacles is naturall, &amp; not so woonderfull as Cambrensis
maketh it. And therefore the examples are not like.</p>
<p>Now it should s&eacute;eme that in Cambrensis his time, the Irish clergie builded their
reason vpon this plot. What soeuer is flesh, is naturallie begotten or ingendred of
flesh; barnacles are not naturallie ingendred of flesh, but onelie of timber and wood;
barnacles therfore are not flesh, vnlesse you would haue them to be wooden flesh.
And if the reason be so knit it may not be disiointed by Cambrensis his example.
As if a man should argue thus. She that is begotten of anie man, must be of force
daughter to that man; Melcha was begotten of Aran; <emph>Ergo</emph> Melcha was Arans
<note place="marg"><emph>Genes.</emph> 11. <emph>verse</emph> 29.</note>
daughter. This argument is of all parts so fortified, as it s&eacute;emeth of all sides to be
impregnable. Yet a busie braine sophister cauilling on the terme (begotten) might
saie, that Eue was begotten of Adam, and yet she is not Adams daughter. True it
<note place="marg">Adam &amp; Eua of no kin.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Thom. p.</emph> 1. <emph>q.</emph> 92. <emph>art.</emph> 2. <emph>ad.</emph> 3. <emph>m.</emph></note>
is that Adam was not Eues father, no more than Eue was Adams mother, neither
by that ingendring was there anie degree of consanguinitie sprong betw&eacute;ene them.
But bicause the word (begotten) is taken in the argument for the naturall ingendring
of man and woman, the instance giuen of Eue dooth not disproue the Maior.
And yet for the better vnderstanding of the question, it is to be noted that the

the contrarie: as for example.</p>

<p>Bicause man is naturallie ingendred of man and woman, no man may naturallie
be ingendred without the copulation of man and woman: yet supernaturallie it may
be. As Adam was made without man and woman: Eue framed without woman:
<note place="marg"><emph>Gen.</emph> 2. <emph>vers.</emph> 7.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Gen.</emph> 2. <emph>ver.</emph> 21.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Luc.</emph> 1. <emph>vers.</emph> 34.</note>
our sauiour Christ begotten without man. And therfore the diuell could not haue
attainted him of originall sinne. Contrariwise, the vnperfect may be ingendred
without s&eacute;ed by mire, mud, doong, carien, rotten timber, or anie other thing; and
chieflie by the secret influence and instillation of the celestiall planets, as the sunne
<note place="marg"><emph>Vide Arist. lib.</emph> 1.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Meteor. ca.</emph> 3. 6. 7.</note>
and such other. As if you put the haire of an horsse taile in mire, puddle, or in a
doonghill for a certeine space, it will turne to a little thin spralling worme, which I
haue often s&eacute;ene &amp; experimented. And they are termed vnperfect, not in respect
of their owne nature, in which they are perfect, but in comparison of other sorts of
liuing things. Among this crue must barnacles be setled. But here some will
saie; Let them be perfect or vnperfect, what then ? I would faine know, whether
Cambrensis be in an errour, or the Irish clergie. For hitherto I s&eacute;e nothing, but Cambrensis
his reason disprooued. And it is often s&eacute;ene that a sound opinion may be
weakened by a f&eacute;eble reason, as we s&eacute;e manie faire garments mard in the making.
It is true: and if anie be desirous to know my mind herein, I suppose, according
<note place="marg">The barnacle neither fish nor flesh.</note>
to my simple iudgement, vnder the correction of both parties, that the barnacle is
neither fish nor flesh, but rather a meane betw&eacute;ene both. As put the case it were
enacted by parlement, that it were high treason to eat flesh on fridaie, and fish on
sundaie. Trulie I thinke that he that eateth barnacles both these daies, should not
be within the compasse of the estatute: yet I would not wish my friend to hazard
it, least the barnacle should be found in law fish or flesh, yea and perhaps fish and
flesh. As when the lion king of beasts made proclamation, that all horned beasts
should auoid his court, one beast hauing but a bunch of flesh in his forehead departed
with the rest, least it had b&eacute;ene found in law that his bunch were an horne.</p>
<p>But some will peraduenture maruell, that there should be anie liuing thing, that
were not fish nor flesh. But they haue no such cause at all. Nits, fleshwormes,
bees, butterflies, caterpillers, snailes, grassehoppers, beetels, earewikes, reremise,
frogs, toads, adders, snakes, &amp; such other, are liuing things, and yet they are
neither fish nor flesh, nor yet red herring: as they that are trained in scholasticall
points may easilie iudge. And so I thinke, that if anie were so sharpe set (the
estatute aboue rehearsed, presupposed) as to eat fried flies, butterd bees, stued
snailes, either on fridaie or sundaie, he could not be therefore indicted of haulte
treason; albeit I would not be his ghest, vnlesse I tooke his table to be furnisht
with more wholesome and licorous viands. The like question may be mooued of
<note place="marg">The sell whether it be fish or flesh.</note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Thom. p.</emph> 1. <emph>a.</emph> 71. <emph>e</emph>. 1. <emph>e</emph>. 3. <emph>e</emph>.</note>
the sell, and if it were well canuassed, it would be found at the leastwise a moot

<p>Ireland is stored of cowes, of excellent horsses, of hawkes, of fish and of

<note place="marg">Dublinum.</note>

<p>DUBLIN the beautie and eie of Ireland, hath b&eacute;ene named by Ptolome, in ancient
time, Eblana. Some terme it Dublina, others Dublinia, manie write it Dublinum,
authors of better skill name it Dublinium. The Irish call it, Ball&eacute;e er Cleagh, that is, a
towne planted vpon hurdels. For the common opinion is, that the plot vpon which the
ciuitie is builded, hath b&eacute;ene a marish ground; and for that by the art or inuention of
the first founder, the water could not be voided, he was forced to fasten the quakemire
with hurdels, and vpon them to build the citie. I heard of some that came of
building of houses to this foundation: and other hold opinion that if a cart or waine
run with a round and maine pase through a str&eacute;et called the high str&eacute;et, the houses on
ech side shall be perceiued to shake. This citie was builded, or rather the buildings
<note place="marg">Dublin builded.</note>
thereof inlarged, about the yeare of our Lord 155. For about this time there arriued in
Ireland thr&eacute;e noble Easterlings that were brethren, Auellanus, Sitaracus, and Yuorus.
<note place="marg">Auellanus the founder of Dublin.</note>
Auellanus being the eldest brother builded Dublin. Sitaracus Waterford, and Yuorus
Limerike. Of the founder Auellanus, Dublin was named Auellana, and after
<note place="marg">Auellana.</note>

<note place="marg">Eblana.</note>
by corruption of speach Eblana. This citie, as it is not in antiquitie inferiour to
anie citie in Ireland, so in pleasant situation, in gorgious buildings, in the multitude
of people, in martiall chiualrie, in obedience and loialtie, in the abundance of
wealth, in largenesse of hospitalite, in maners and ciuilitie it is superiour to all other
cities and townes in that realme. And therefore it is commonlie called the Irish or
yoong London. The seat of this citie is of all sides pleasant, comfortable, and

crowne of England k&eacute;epe so great a port, none I am sure greater. The maior, ouer
the number of officers that take their dailie repast at his table, keepeth for his yeare
in maner open house. And albeit in tearme time his house is frequented as well of
the nobilitie as of other potentats of great calling: yet his ordinarie is so good,
that a verie few set feasts are prouided for them. They that spend least in their
maioraltie (as those of credit, yea and such as bare the office haue informed me)
make an ordinarie account of fiue hundred pounds for their viand and diet that
yeare: which is no small summe to be bestowed in housk&eacute;eping, namelie where
vittels are so good cheape, and the presents of friends diuerse and sundrie.</p>
<p>There hath beene of late yeares a worshipfull gentleman, named Patrike Scarsefield,
<note place="marg"><date>1551.</date></note>

<note place="marg">Patrike Scarsefield his hospitatalitie.</note>
that bare the office of the maioraltie in Dublin, who kept so great port in this
yeare, as his hospitalitie to his fame and renowme resteth as yet in fresh memorie.
One of his especiall and entire friends entring in communication with the gentleman,
his yeare being well neere expired, mooued question, to what he thought his
expenses all that yeare amounted? Trulie Iames (so his friend was named) quoth
maister Scarsefield, I take betw&eacute;ene me and God, when I entered into mine office,
the last saint Hierome his daie (which is the morrow of Michaelmasse, on which
<note place="marg">The maior of Dublin when he is sworne.</note>
daie the maior taketh his oth before the chiefe baron, at the excheker within the
castell of Dublin) I had thr&eacute;e barnes well stored and thwackt with corne, and I
assured my selfe, that anie one of these thr&eacute;e had bene sufficient to haue stored
mine house with bread, ale, and b&eacute;ere for this yeare. And now God and good
companie be thanked, I stand in doubt, whether I shall rub out my maioraltie with
my third barne, which is well nigh with my yeare ended. And yet nothing
smiteth me so much at the heart, as that the knot of good fellowes that you s&eacute;e
here (he ment the sergeants and officers) are readie to flit from me, and make their
next yeares abode with the next maior.</p>
<p>And certes I am so much wedded to good fellowship, as if I could mainteine
mine house to my contentation, with defraieng of fiue hundred pounds yearelie;
I would make humble sute to the citizens, to be their officer these thr&eacute;e yeares to
come. Ouer this, he did at the same time protest with oth, that he spent that yeare
in housek&eacute;eping twentie tuns of claret wine, ouer and aboue white wine, sacke,
malmeseie, muscadell, &amp;c. And in verie deed it was not to be maruelled: for
during his maioraltie, his house was so open, as commonly from fiue of the clocke
in the morning, to ten at night, his butterie and cellars were with one crew or
other frequented. To the haunting of which, ghests were the sooner allured, for
that you should neuer marke him or his bedfellow (such was their buxomnesse)
once frowne or wrinkle their foreheads, or bend their browes, or glowme their
countenances, or make a sowre face at anie ghest, were he neuer so meane. But
their interteinment was so notable, as they would sauce their bountifull &amp; deintie
faire with heartie and amiable ch&eacute;ere. His porter or anie other officer durst not for
both his eares giue the simplest man that resorted to his house Tom drum his interteinment,
<note place="marg">Tom drum his interteinment,</note>
which is, to hale a man in by the head, and thrust him out by both the
shoulders. For he was fullie resolued, that his worship and reputation could not
be more distained, than by the currish interteinment of anie ghest. To be briefe

</lg></quote></p>


<p>Some of his friends, that were snudging peniefathers, would take him vp verie
roughlie for his lauishing &amp; his outragious expenses, as they tearme it. Tush my
maisters (would he saie) take not the matter so hot: who so commeth to my table,
and hath no n&eacute;ed of my meat, I know he commeth for the good will he beareth me;
and therefore I am beholding to thanke him for his companie: if he resort for n&eacute;ed,
how maie I bestow my goods better, than in rel&eacute;eving the poore? If you had perceiued
me so far behind hand, as that I had bene like to haue brought haddocke to
paddocke, I would patientlie permit you, both largelie to controll me, and friendlie
to reproue me. But so long as I cut so large thongs of mine owne leather, as that
I am not yet come to my buckle, and during the time I k&eacute;epe my selfe so farre
aflote, as that I haue as much water as my ship draweth: I praie pardon me to be
liberall in spending, sith Godof his goodnesse is gratious in sending.</p>
<p>And in d&eacute;ed so it fell out. For at the end of his maioraltie he owght no man a
dotkin. What he dispended was his owne: and euer after during his life, he kept
so woorthie a standing house, as that h&eacute;e s&eacute;emed to surrender the princes sword to
other maiors, and reserued the port &amp; hospitalitie to himselfe. Not long before
him was Nicholas Stanihurst their maior, who was so great and good an housholder.
<note place="marg">Nicholas Stanihurst.</note>
that during his maioraltie, the lord chancellor of the realme was his daille and ordinarie
ghest. There hath beene of late worshipfull ports kept by maister Fian, who
was twise maior, maister Sedgraue, Thomas Fitz Simons, Robert Cusacke, Walter
Cusacke, Nicholas Fitz Simons, Iames Bedlow, Christopher Fagan, and diuerse
<note place="marg">The hospitalitie of Dublin.</note>
others. And not onelie their officers so farre excell in hospitalitie, but also the
greater part of the ciuitie is generallie addicted to such ordinarie and standing
houses, as it would make a man muse which waie they are able to beare it out, but
onelie by the goodnesse of God, which is the vpholder and furtherer of hospitalitie.
What should I here speake of their charitable almes, dailie and hourelie extended
to the n&eacute;edie? The poore prisoners both of the Newgate and the castell, with thr&eacute;e
or foure hospitals, are chieflie, if not onelie, relieued by the citizens.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are so manie other extraordinarie beggers that dailie swaruie
there, so charitablie succored, as that they make the whole ciuitie in effect their
hospitall. The great expenses of the citizens maie probablie be gathered by the
woorthie and fairlike markets, weeklie on wednesdaie and fridaie kept in Dublin.
Their shambles is so well stored with meat, and their market with come, as not
<note place="marg">The shambles and markets at Dublin.</note>
onelie in Ireland, but also in other countries you shall not s&eacute;e anie one shambles, or
anie one market better furnished with the one or the other, than Dublin is. The
citizens haue from time to time in sundrie conflicts so galled the Irish, that euen to
this daie, the Irish feare a ragged and iagged blacke standard that the citizens

haue, almost through tract of time worne to the hard stumps. This standard they
carrie with them in hostings, being neuer displaied but when they are readie to

aboue measure.</p>
<p>And for the better training of their youth in martiall exploits, the citizens vse to

maior of the Bull ring is an office elected by the citizens, to be as it were capteine or
gardian of the batchelers and the vnwedded youth of the ciuitie. And for the yeare he
hath authoritie to chastise and punish such as frequent brothelhouses, and the like vnchast
places. He is tearmed the maior of the Bull ring, of an iron ring that sticketh
in the cornemarket, to which the bulles that are yearelie bated be vsuallie tied:
which ring is had by him and his companie in so great price, as if anie citizen batcheler
hap to marrie, the maior of the Bull ring and his crue conduct the bridegroome
vpon his returne from church, to the market place, and there with a
soiemne kisse for his <emph>Vltimum vale,</emph> he dooth homage vnto the Bull ring.</p>
<p>The Blacke mondaie muster sproong of this occasion. Soone after Ireland was
<note place="marg">The blacke mondaie.</note>
conquered by the Britons, and the greater part of Leinster pacified, diuerse townesmen
of Bristow flitted from thense to Dublin, and in short space the ciuitie was by
<note place="marg">Dublin inhabited by the Bristollians.</note>

<note place="marg">This was about the yeare of our Lord 1209.</note>
them so well inhabited, as it grew to b&eacute;e verie populous. Wherevpon the citizens
hauing ouer great affiance in the multitude of the people, and so consequentlie
being somewhat retchlesse in h&eacute;eding the mounteine enimie that lurked vnder
their noses, were woont to rome and roile in clusters, sometime thr&eacute;e or foure
miles from the towne. The Irish enimie spieng that the citizens were accustomed
to fetch such od vagaries, especiallie on the holie daies, &amp; hauing an inkling withall
by some false clatterfert or other, that a companie of them would haue ranged
abrode, on mondaie in the Easter weeke towards the wood of Cullen, which is
distant two miles from Dublin, they laie in stale verie well appointed, and laid in
sundrie places for their comming. The citizens rather minding the pleasure they
should presentlie inioy, than forecasting the hurt that might insue, flockt vnarmed
out of the ciuitie to the wood, where being intercepted by them that laie hoouing
in ambush, they were to the number of fiue hundred miserablie slaine. Wherevpon
the remnant of the citizens deeming that vnluckie time to be a crosse or a dismall
daie, gaue it the appellation of Black mondaie.</p>
<p>The citie soone after being peopled by a fresh supplie of Bristollians, to dare the
Irish enimie, agr&eacute;ed to banket yearelie in that place, which to this daie is obserued.
For the maior and the shiriffs with the citizens repaire to the wood of Cullen, in
which place the maior bestoweth a costlie dinner within a mote or a rundell, and
both the shiriffs within another: where they are so well garded with the youth of
the ciuitie, as the mounteine animie dareth not attempt to snatch as much as a
pastie crust from thense. Dublin hath at this daie within the citie and in the

onelie Christs church with a few oratories and chappels excepted. Christs church,
<note place="marg">Christs church.</note>
otherwise named <emph>Ecclesia sanct&oelig; trinitatis,</emph> a cathedrall church, the ancientest that I
can find recorded of all the churches now standing in Dublin. I take it to haue
beene builded, if not in Auellanus his time, yet soone after by the Danes. The building
of which was both repared &amp; inlarged by Critius prince of Dublin, at the earnest
request of Donat the bishop, and soone after the conquest it hath b&eacute;ene much beautified
by Robert Fitz Stephans and Strangbow the erie of Penbroke, who with his
sonne is in the bodie of the church intoomed. The chappell that standeth in the
chore, commonlie called the new chappell, was builded by Gerald Fitz Thomas earle
of Kildare, in the yeare of our Lord 1510, where he is intoomed.</p>
<p>Saint Patrikes church, a cathedrall church, indued with notable liuings; and
diuerse fat benefices. It hath a chappell at the north doore which is called the
paroch church. This church was founded by the famous and woorthie prelate Iohn
Commin, about the yeare of our Lord 1197. This foundation was greatlie aduanced
by the liberalitie of king Iohn. There hath risen a great contention
<note place="marg">The contreuersie betwe&eacute;ene Christ church and saint Patriks church.</note>
betwixt this church and Christes church for antiquitie, wherein doubtlesse S.

and better reasons to build vpon than their foundations, in which this church by
manie yeares is inferior to the other. Saint Nicholas, Saint Michaell, Saint Verberosse,
or Saint Varburgh, so called of a Chesshire virgine. The citizens of Chester
founded this church, with two chappels thereto annexed; the one called our ladies
chappell, the other S. Martins chappell. Hir feast is kept the third of Februarie.
This church with a great part of the citie was burned in the yeare 1301: but agaiue
by the parochians reedified. Saint Iohn the euangelist, Saint Audeon, which is
corruptlie called Saint Ouen, or Owen. His feast is solemnized the fourt&eacute;enth of
August. The paroch of this church is accounted the best in Dublin, for that the
greater number of the aldermen and the worships of the citie are demurrant within
that paroch.</p>
<p>Saint Tullocke now prophaned. In this church in old time, the familie of the
<note place="marg">Fitz Simons.</note>
Fitz Simons was for the more part buried. The paroch was meared from the Crane
castell, to the fish shambles, called the Cockhill, with Preston his innes, &amp; the

Dublin, continuing six daies, vnto which resorted diuers merchants, as well from
England, as from France and Flanders. And they afforded their wares so dogcheape,
in respect of the citie merchants, that the countrie was yeare by yeare sufficientlie
stored by strangers: and the citie merchants not vttering their wares, but
to such as had not readie chinkes, and therevpon forced to run on the score,
were verie much impouerished. Wherefore partlie thorough the canuasing of
the towne merchants, and partlie by the winking of the rest of the citizens,
being woon vpon manie gaie glosed promises, by plaieng bop&eacute;epe to beare themselues
ouerlie in the matter, that famous mart was supprest, and all forren saile
wholie abandoned. Yet for a memoriall of this notable faire, a few cottages,

The reason why this gate, and the Wine tauerne gate were builded, proc&eacute;eded of
this. In the yeare 1315, Edward Bruise a Scot, &amp; brother to Robert Bruise king
of Scots arriued in the north of Ireland. From whence he marched on forwards
with his armie, vntill he came as far as Castleknocke. The citizens of Dublin being
sore amazed at the sudden and Scarborough approch of so puissant an enimie,
burned all the houses in Saint Thomas his str&eacute;et, least he should vpon his repaire
to Dublin haue anie succour in the suburbs. The maior (named Robert Notingham)
and communaltie being in this distresse, razed downe an abbeie of the frier preachers,
called Saint Sauiour his monasterie, and brought the stones thereof to these places,
where the gates now stand; and all along that waie did cast a wall for the better
fortifieng of the ciultie, mistrusting that the wals that went along both the keies,
should not haue b&eacute;ene of sufficient force to outhold the enimie. The Scots hauing
intelligence of the fortifieng of Dublin, and reckoning it a folie to laie siege to so
impregnable a ciuitie, marched toward a place not far from Dublin, called the

that although lawes were squatted in warre, yet notwithstanding they ought to be
reuiued in peace. Gurmund his gate, hard by the Cucull, or Coockolds post.
Some suppose, that one Gurmundus builded this gate, and thereof to take the
name. Others iudge, that the Irish assaulting the cinitie, were discomfited by the
earle of Ormond, then by good hap soiourning at Dublin. And because he issued
out at that gate, to the end the valiant exploit and famous conquest of so woorthie
a potentate should be ingrailed in perpetuall memorie, the gate bare the name of

And as an insearcher of antiquities may (by the view there to be taken) coniecture,
the better part of the suburbs of Dublin should s&eacute;eme to haue stretched that waie.
But the inhabitants being dailie and hourelie molested and preided by their prolling
mounteine neighbors, were forced to suffer their buildings fall in decaie, and embaied
themselues within the citie wals.</p>
<p>Among other monuments, there is a place in that lane called now Collets innes,
<note place="marg">The old Escacar.</note>
which in old time was the Escaxar or Excheker. Which should implie that the
princes court would not haue b&eacute;ene kept there, unlesse the place had b&eacute;ene taken
to be cocksure. But in fine it fell out contrarie. For the baron sitting there solemnlie,
and as it seemed, retchleslie: the Irish espieng the oportunitie, rushed into
the court in plumps, where surprising the vnweaponed multitude, they committed
horrible slaughters by sparing none that came vnder their dint: and withall, as far
as their Scarborough leasure could serue them, they ransacke the prince his thesaure,
vpon which mishap the excheker was from thense remooued. There hath
beene also in that lane a chappell dedicated to saint George, likelie to haue b&eacute;ene
<note place="marg">S. George his chappeli.</note>
founded by some worthie knight of the garter. The maior with his brethren was
accustomed with great triumphs and pageants y&eacute;erelie on saint George his feast to
repaire to that chappell, and there to offer. This chappell hath beene of late razed,
and the stones therof by consent of the assemblie turned to a common ouen, conuerting
the ancient monument of a doutie, aduenturous, and holie knight, to the
colerake sw&eacute;eping of a pufloafe baker. The great bridge going to Ostmantowne,

much beautified with sundrie and gorgious buildings in the time of sir Henrie

There is a village hard by Dublin, called of the said la Beale, chappell Isoud.</p>

<p>Saint Pulchers, the archbishop of Dublin his house, as well pleasantlie sited as
<note place="marg">Saint Pulchers.</note>
gorgeouslie builded. Some hold opinion, that the beautifuller part of this house
was of set purpose fired by an archbishop, to the end the gouernors (which for the
more part laie there) should not haue so goodliking to the house: not far disagr&eacute;eing
from the policie that I heard a noble man tell he used, who hauing a surpassing
good horse, and such a one as ouer ran in a set race other choise horses, did bobtaile
him vpon his returne to the stable, least anie of his fr&eacute;ends casting a fantasie
to the beast, should craue him. The noble man being so bountifullie giuen, as that

<note place="marg">The names of the fields adioining to Dublin.</note>
the further end of this field is there a hole commonlie termed Scald brothers hole,
a labyrinth reaching two large miles vnder the earth. This hole was in old time
frequented by a notorious th&eacute;efe named Scaldbrother, wherein he would hide all
<note place="marg">Scaldbrother.</note>
the bag and baggage that he could pilfer. The varlet was so swift on foot, as he
hath eftsoones outrun the swiftest and lustiest yoong men in all Ostmantowne,
maugre their heads, bearing a pot or a pan of theirs on his shoulders to his den.
And now and then, in derision of such as pursued him, he would take his course
vnder the gallows, which standeth verie nigh his caue (a fit signe for such an inne)
and so being shrowded within his lodge, he reckoned himselfe cocksure, none
being found at that time so hardie as would aduenture to intangle himselfe within
so intricat a maze. But as the pitcher that goeth often to the water, commeth
at length home broken: so this lustie youth would not surcease from open catching,
forcible snatching, and priuie prolling, till time he was by certeine gaping groomes
that laie in wait for him, intercepted, fl&eacute;eing toward his couch, hauing upon his
apprehension no more wrong doone him, than that he was not sooner hanged on that

standeth in Ostmantowne gr&eacute;ene an hillocke, named little Iohn his shot. The

<p>In the y&eacute;ere one thousand one hundred foure score and nine, there ranged three

<note place="marg">Robert Hood.</note>
robbers and outlaws in England, among which Robert Hood and little Iohn were
cheefeteins, of all theeues doubtlesse the most courteous. Robert Hood being
betraied at a nunrie in Scotland called Bricklies, the remnant of the crue was scattered,
and euerie man forced to shift for himselfe. Wherevpon little Iohn was faine
to fl&eacute;e the realme by sailing into Ireland, where he soiornied for a few daies at
Dublin. The citizens being doone to vnderstand the wandering outcast to be an
excellent archer, requested him hartilie to trie how far he could shoot at randon:
who y&eacute;elding to their behest, stood on the bridge of Dublin, and shot to that mole
hill, leaning behind him a monument, rather by his posteritie to be woondered, than
possiblie by anie man liuing to be counterscored. But as the repaire of so notorious
a champion to anie countrie would soone be published, so his abode could not be
long concealed: and therefore to eschew the danger of lawes, he fled into Scotland,
<note place="marg">Little Iohn deceased.</note>
where he died at a towne or village called Morauie. Gerardus Mercator in his cosmographie
affirmeth, that in the same towne the bones of an huge and mightie man
are kept, which was called little Iohn, among which bones, the hucklebone or
hipbone was of such largenesse, as witnesseth Hector Boetius, that he thrust his
arme through the hole thereof. And the same bone being suted to the other parts
of his bodie, did argue the man to haue b&eacute;ene fourteene foot long, which was a
pretie length for a little Iohn. Whereby appeereth that he was called little

Iohn ironicallie, like as we terme him an honest man whom we take for a knaue in
graine.</p>
<p>Neere to the citie of Dublin are the foure ancient manors annexed to the crowne,
<note place="marg">The king his land</note>
which are named to this daie, the Kings land; to wit, Newcastell, Massaggard,
Eschire, and Crumlin. The manor of Crumlin paieth a great ch&eacute;efe rent to the
<note place="marg">Crumlin.</note>
prince than anie of the other three, which proc&eacute;eded of this. The seneschall being
offended with the tenants for their misdemeanor, tooke then vp very sharplie in
the court, and with rough and minatorie sp&eacute;eches began to menace them. The
lobbish and desperat clobberiousnesse, taking the matter in dudgeon, made no more
words, but knockt their seneschall on the costard, and left him there spralling on
the ground for dead. For which detestable murther their rent was inhansed, and
they paie at this daie nine pence an acre, which is double to anie of the other thr&eacute;e
manors.</p>
<p>Waterford was founded by Sitaracus (as is aforesaid) in the yeere one hundred
<note place="marg">Waterford.</note>

<note place="marg">Manapia.</note>
fiftie and fiue. Ptolome nameth it Manapia, but whie he appropriateth that name
to this citie, neither dooth he declare, nor I ghesse. This city is properlie builded,
and verie well compact, somewhat close by reason of their thicke buildings and
narrow str&eacute;ets. The hauen is passing good, by which the citizens through the intercourse
of forren traffike in short space atteine to abundance of wealth. The
soile about it is not all of the best, by reason of which the aire is not verie subtill,
yea nathelesse the sharpnesse of their wittes s&eacute;emeth to be nothing rebated or duld
by reason of the grossenesse of the aire. For in good sooth the townesmen, and
namelie students are pregnant in conceiuing, quicke in taking, and sure in k&eacute;eping.
The citizens are verie h&eacute;edie and warie in all their publike affaires, slow in the
determining of matters of weight, louing to looke yer they leape. In choosing
their magistrate, they respect not onlie his riches, but also they weigh his experience.
And therefore they elect for their maior neither a rich man that is yoong,
nor an old man that is poore. They are cheerfull in the interteinment of strangers,
hartie one to another, nothing giuen to factions. They lone no idle benchwhistlers,
nor luskish faitors: for yoong and old are wholie addicted to thriuing, the men
commonlie to traffike, the women to spinning and carding. As they distill the
best <emph>Aqua vit&oelig;,</emph> so they spin the choisest rug in Ireland. A fr&eacute;end of mine being
of late demurrant in London, and the weather by reason of an hard hoare frost
being somwhat nipping, repaired to Paris garden, clad in one of these Waterferd
rugs. The mastifs had no sooner espied him, but d&eacute;eming he had b&eacute;ene a beare,
would faine haue baited him. And were it not that the dogs were partlie muzzled,
and partlie chained, he doubted not, but that he should haue b&eacute;ene well tugd in
this Irish rug; wherevpon he solemnlie vowed neuer to see beare baiting in anie
such w&eacute;ed. The citie of Waterford hath continued to the crowne of England so
loiali, that it is not found registred since the conquest to haue b&eacute;ene distained with
the smallest spot, or dusked with the least freckle of treason; notwithstanding the
sundrie assaults of traitorous attempts: and therefore the cities armes are deckt
with this golden word, <emph>Intacta manei</emph>: a posie as well to be hartilie followed, as
<note place="marg">The posie of Waterford.</note>
greatlie admired of all true and loiall townes.</p>
<p>Limerike called in Latine <emph>Limericum</emph> was builded by Yuorns, as is before mentioned,
<note place="marg">Limerike.</note>
about the y&eacute;ere one hundred fiftie and fiue. This citie coasteth on the sea

building of the citie was stored with grasse. During which time it happened, that
one of the Irish potentates, raising warre against another of his peers, incamped
in that Ile, hauing so great a troope of horssemen, as the horsses eate vp the grasse

in foure and twentie hours. Wherevpon for the notorious number of horses, the
place is called Loum ne augh; that is, the horse bare, or a place made bare or
eaten vp by horses. The verie maine sea is thr&eacute;e score miles distant from the
towne, and yet the riuer is so nauigable, as a ship of two hundred tuns may saile
to the keie of the citie. The riuer is termed in Irish Shaune amne, that is, the
old riuer; for shaune is old, &amp; amne is a riuer, deducted of the Latine word <emph>Amnis.</emph>
The building of Limerike is sumptuous and substantiall.</p>
<p>Corke, in Latine <emph>Coracium</emph> or <emph>Corracium,</emph> the fourth citie of Ireland happilie
<note place="marg">Corke.</note>
planted on the sea. Their hauen is an hauen roiall. On the land side they are incombred
with euill neighbors, the Irish outlaws, that they are faine to watch
their gates hourlie, to k&eacute;epe them shut at seruice times, at meales from sun to sun,
nor suffer anie stranger to enter the citie with his weapon, but the same to leaue at
a lodge appointed. They walke out at seasons for recreation with power of men
furnished. They trust not the countrie adioining, but match in wedlocke among
themselues onelie, so that the whole citie is welnigh linked one to the other in affinitie.
Drogheda, accounted the best towne in Ireland, and trulie not far behind
<note place="marg">Drogheda.</note>
some of their cities. The one moitie of this towne is in Meth, the other planted
on the further side of the water lieth in Ulster. There runneth a blind prophesie
on this towne, that Rosse was, Dublin is, Drogheda shall be the best of the
three.</p>
<p>Rosse, an hauen towne in Mounster not far from Waterford, which s&eacute;emeth to
<note place="marg">Rosse.</note>
haue b&eacute;ene in ancient time a towne of great port. Whereof sundrie &amp; probable
coniectures are giuen, as well by the old ditches that are now a mile distant from
the wals of Rosse, betweene which wals and ditches the reliks of the ancient wals,
gates, and towers, placed betweene both are yet to be seene. The towne is builded
in a barren soile, and planted among a crue of naughtie and prolling neighbours.
And in old time when it florished, albeit the towne were sufficientlie peopled, yet
as long as it was not compassed with wals, they were formed with watch &amp; ward,
to keepe it from the gr&eacute;edie snatching of the Irish enimies. With whome as they
were generallie molested, so the priuat cousening of one pezzant on a sudden, incensed
them to inuiron their towne with strong and substantiall wals. There repaired
one of the Irish to this towne on horssebacke, and espieng a peece of cloth
on a merchants stall, tooke hold thereof, and bet the cloth to the lowest price he
could. As the merchant and he stood dodging one with the other in cheaping the
ware, the horsseman considering that he was well mounted, and that the merchant
and he had growne to a price, made wise as though he would haue drawne to his
purse, to haue defraied the monie. The cloth in the meane while being tucked vp and
placed before him, he gaue the spur to his horsse and ran awaie with the cloth, being
not imbard from his posting pase, by reason the towne was not perclosed either
with ditch or wall. The townesmen being pinched at the heart, that one rascal in
such scornefull wise should giue them the slampaine, not so much weieng the slendernesse
of the losse, as the shamefulnesse of the foile, they put their heads togither,
consulting how to preuent either the sudden rushing, or the posthast flieng
of anie such aduenturous rakehell hereafter.</p>
<p>In which consultation a famous Dido, a chast widow, a politike dame, a bountifull
gentlewoman, called Rose, who representing in sinceritie of life the sw&eacute;etnesse
<note place="marg">Rose of Rosse.</note>
of that hearbe whose name she bare, vnfolded the deuise, how anie such future
mischance should be preuented: and withall opened hir coffers liberallie, to
haue it furthered: two good properties in a councellor. Hir deuise was, that the
towne should incontinentlie be inclosed with wals, &amp; there withall promised to discharge
the charges, so that they would not sticke to find out labourers. The deuise
of this worthie matrone being wise, and the offer liberall, the townesmen agreed

to follow the one, and to put their helping hands to the atchiuing of the other.
The worke was begun, which thorough the multitude of hands s&eacute;emed light. For
the whole towne was assembled, tag and rag, cut and long taile: none exempted,
but such as were bedred and impotent. Some were tasked to delue, others appointed
with mattocks to dig, diuerse allotted to the vnheaping of rubbish, manie
bestowed to the cariage of stones, sundrie occupied in tempering of morter, the
better sort busied in ouerseeing the workmen, ech one according to his vocation
imploied, as though the ciuitie of Carthage were afresh in building, as it is
featlie verified by the golden poet Virgil, and neatlie Englished by master doctor
Phaer.</p>

labourers were so manie, the worke, by reason of round and excheker paiment, so
well applied, the quarrie of faire marble so neere at hand (for they affirme, that
out of the trenches and ditches hard by their rampiers, the stones were had: and
all that plot is so stonie, that the foundation is an hard rocke) that these wals with
diuerse braue turrets were suddenlie mounted, and in manner sooner finished, than
to the Irish enimies notified: which I wisse was no small corsie to them. These
wals in circuit are equall to London wals. It hath three gorgeous gates, Bishop
his gate, on the east side: Algate, on the east southeast side: and Southgate, on
the south part. This towne was no more famoused for these wals, than for a notable
woodden bridge that stretched from the towne vnto the other side of the
water, which must haue b&eacute;ene by reasonable surueie twelue score, if not more.

Diuerse of the poales, logs, and stakes, with which the bridge was vnderpropt,
sticke to this daie in the water. A man would here suppose, that so flourishing a
towne, so firmelie builded, so substantiallie walled, so well peopled, so plentiouslie
with thriftie artificers stored, would not haue fallen to anie sudden decaie.</p>
<p>But as the secret and d&eacute;epe iudgements of God are veiled within the couerture
<note place="marg">Rosse decaied.</note>
of his diuine maiestie, so it standeth not with the dulnesse of man his wit, to beat
his braines in the curious insearching of hidden mysteries. Wherefore I, as an
historian vndertaking in this treatise, rather plainelie to declare what was doone,
than rashlie to inquire why it should be doone: purpose, by God his assistance, to
accomplish, as n&eacute;ere as I can, my datie in the one, leauing the other to the friuolous
deciding of busie heads. This Rose, who was the foundresse of these
former rehearsed wals, had issue thr&eacute;e sonnes (howbeit some hold opinion, that they
were but hir nephues) who being bolstered out thorough the wealth of their moother,
and supported by their traffike, made diuerse prosperous voiages into forren countries.
But as one of the thr&eacute;e chapmen was imploied in his traffike abroad, so the
prettie poplet his wife began to be a fresh occupieng giglot at home, and by report
tell so farre acquainted with a religious cloisterer of the towne, as that he gat within
the lining of hir smocke. Both the parties wallowing ouerlong in the stinking
puddle of adulterie, suspicion began to cr&eacute;epe in some townesmens brains: and to
be briefe, it came so farre, thorough the iust iudgement of God, to light, whether
it were that she was with child in hir husband his absence, or that hir louer vsed hir
fondlie in open presence, as the presumption was not onelie vehement, but also the
fact too apparent: hir vnfortunat husband had no sooner notice giuen him vpon
his returne of these sorowfull newes, than his fingers began to nibble, his teeth to
grin, his eies to trickle, his eares to dindle, his head to dazell, insomuch as his
heart being scared with gelousie, and his with installed thorough phrensie, he became
<note place="marg">The pangs of gelousie.</note>
as mad as a March hare.</p>
<p>But how heauilie soeuer hir husband tooke it, dame Rose and all hir friends
(which were in effect all the townesmen, for that she was their common benefactresse)
were galled at their hearts, as well to heare of the enormious adulterie,
as to s&eacute;e the bedlem pangs of brainsicke gelousie. Wherevpon diuerse of the
townesmen grunting and grudging at the matter, said that the fact was horrible, and
that it were a deed of charitie vtterlie to grub awaie such wild shrubs from the towne:
and if this were in anie dispunishable wise raked vp in the ashes, they should no
sooner trauerse the seas, than some other would inkindle the like fire afresh, and
so consequentlie dishonest their wiues, and make their husbands to become changelings,
as being turned from sober mood to be hornewood, because rutting wiues
make often rammish husbands, as our prouerb dooth inferre. Others soothing their
fellowes in these mutinies turned the priuat iniurie vnto a publike quarrell, and a
number of the townesmen conspiring togither flocked in the dead of the night,
well appointed, to the abbeie, wherein the frier was cloistered (the monument of
which abbeie is yet to be s&eacute;ene at Rosse on the south side) where vndersparring the
gates, and bearing vp the dormitorie doore, they stabbed the adulterer with the
rest of the couent thorough with their weapons. Where they left them goaring
in their bloud, roaring in their cabbins, and gasping vp their flitting ghosts in
their couches.</p>
<p>The vprore was great, and they to whome the slaughter before hand was not
imparted, were wonderfullie thereat astonied. But in especiall the remnant of

thr&eacute;e brethren not long after this bloudie exploit, sped them into some outlandish.
countrie to continue their trade. The religious men being doone to vnderstand,
as it seemed, by some of their neighbors, which foresailed them homeward, that
these thr&eacute;e brethren were readie to be imbarked, slunkt priuilie out of the towne,
and resorted to the mouth of the hauen, n&eacute;ere a castell, named Hulke tower,
<note place="marg">Hulke tower.</note>
which is a notable marke for pilots, in directing them which waie to sterne their
ships, and to eschew the danger of the craggie rocks there on euerie side of the
shore peking. Some iudge that the said Rose was foundresse of this tower, and
of purpose did build it for the safetie of hir children, but at length it turned to
their bane. For these reuengers nightlie did not misse to laie a lanterne on the
top of the rocks, that were on the other side of the water. Which practise was
not long by them continued, when these three passengers bering saile with a lustie
gale of wind, made right vpon the lanterne, not doubting, but it had b&eacute;ene the
Hulke tower. But they tooke their marke so farre amisse, as they were not ware,
till time their ship was dasht and pasht against the rocks, and all the passengers
ouerwhirled in the sea.</p>
<p>This heauie hap was not so sorowfull vnto the townesmen, as it was gladsome to
the religious, thinking that they had in part cried them acquittance, the more that
they, which were drowned, were the archbrochers of their brethrens bloud. Howbeit
they would not crie hoa here, but sent in post some of their couent to Rome,
where they inhansed the slaughter of the fraternitie so heinouslie, and concealed
their owne prankes so couertlie, as the pope excommenged the towne, the towne
accurssed the friers: so that there was such curssing and banning of all hands, and
such dissentious hurlie burlie raised betw&eacute;ene themselues, as the estate of that flourishing
towne was turned arsie versie, topside the otherwaie, and from abundance
of prosperitie quite exchanged to extreame penurie.</p>
<p>The wals stand to this daie, a few streets and houses in the towne, no small parcell

vp youth was rare and singular, framing the education according to the scholers
veine. If he found him fr&eacute;e, he would bridle him like a wise Isocrates from his
booke; if he perceiued him to be dull, he would spur him forward; if he vnderstood
that he were the woorse for beating, he would win him with rewards: finallie,
by interlasing studie with recreation, sorrow with mirth, paine with pleasure,
sowernesse with sweetnesse, roughnesse with mildnesse, he had so good successe

none better. And bicause it was my happie hap (God and my parents be thanked)

osiars and twigs, little wodden churches, and in fashioning the furnitures thereto
apperteining. Being stept further in yeares, he made his repaire into England,
where cloistering himselfe in an abbeie, wherof one named Doctus was abbat, he
was wholie wedded to his booke, and to deuotion: wherein he continued so painefull
and diligent, as being on a certeine time penning a serious matter, and hauing

Of the Strange and Woonderfull Places in Ireland.</head>

<head>The Fourth Chapter.</head>

<p>I THINKE it good to begin with S. Patrike his purgatorie, partlie bicause it is
<note place="marg">S. Patrike his purgatorie.</note>
most notoriouslie knowne, &amp; partlie the more, that some writers, as the author
of Polychronicon and others that were miscaried by him, s&eacute;eme to make great
doubt where they n&eacute;ed not. For they ascribe the finding out of the place not to
Patrike that conuerted the countrie, but an other Patrike an abbat, whom likewise
they affirme to haue b&eacute;ene imploied in conuerting the Iland from beathenrie to
christianitie.</p>
<p>But the author that brocheth this opinion, is not found to carie anie such credit
with him, as that a man may certeinlie affirme it, or probablie coniecture it; vnlesse
we relie to the old withered worme eaten legend, loded with as manie lowd lies, as
lewd lines. The better and the more certeine opinion is, that the other Patrike
found it out, in such wise as Cambrensis reporteth. There is a poole or lake, saith
<note place="marg"><emph>Camb. lib.</emph> 1. <emph>topag. dist.</emph> 2. <emph>rub.</emph> 6.</note>
he, in the parts of Vlster, that inuironneth an Iland, in the one part whereof there
standeth a church much lightned with the brightsome recourse of angels: the
other part is ouglie and gastlie, as it were a bedlem allotted to the visible assemblies
of horrible and grislie bugs. This part of the Iland conteineth nine caues. And if
anie dare be so hardie, as to take one night his lodging in anie of these ins, which
hath b&eacute;ene experimented by some rash &amp; harebraine aduenturers, streight these
spirits claw him by the backe, and tug him so ruggedlie, and tosse him so crabbedlie,
that now and then they make him more franke of his bum than of his toong;
a paiment correspondent to his interteinement. This place is called S. Patrike his
purgatorie of the inhabitors. For when S. Patrike laboured the conuersion of the
people of Vlster, by setting before their eies in great heat of spirit, the creation of
the world, the fall of our progenitors, the redemption of man by the blessed and
pretious bloud of our sauiour Iesus Christ, the certeintie of death, the immortalitie of
the soule, the generall resurrection, our latter doome, the ioies of heauen, the paines
of hell, how that at length euerie man, small and great, yoong and old, rich and
poore, king and keaser, potentate and pezzant must either through God his gratious
mercie be exalted to the one, to floorish in perpetuall felicitie; or through his
vnsearchable iustice tumble downe to the other, to be tormented in eternall miserie.
These and the like graue and weightie sentences, wherwith he was abundantlie
stored, so far sunke into their harts, as they s&eacute;emed verie flexible in condescending
to his behest: so that some proofe of his estrange preaching could haue b&eacute;ene
verefied. Wherevpon, without further delaie, they spake to the prelat in this wise.</p>
<p>"Sir, as we like of your preaching, so we dislike not of our libertie. You tell
vs of manie gugawes and estrange dreames. You would haue vs to abandon infidelitie,
to cage vp our libertie, to bridle our pleasure: for which you promise vs for
our toile and labour a place to vs as vnknowen, so as yet vncerteine. You sermon to
vs of a dungeon appointed for offendors and miscredents. In deed if we could find
that to be true, we would the sooner be weaned from the sweet nappie of our
libertie, and frame our selues pliant to the will of that God, that you reueale vnto
vs." S. Patrike considering, that these sealie soules were (as all dulcarnanes for the
more part are) more to be terrified from infidelitie through the paines of hell, than
allured to christianitie by the ioies of heauen, most hartilie besought God, so it
stood with his gratious pleasure, for the honour and glorie of his diuine name, to
giue out some euident or glimsing token of the matter they importunatlie required.

Finallie by the especiall direction of God, he found in the north edge of Vlster a
desolate corner hemmed in round, and in the middle thereof a pit. where he reared
a church, called Reglis or Reglasse. At the east end of the churchyard a doore
<note place="marg">Reglasse.</note>
leadeth into a closet of stone like a long ouen, which they call S. Patrike his purgatorie,
for that the people resort thither euen at this daie for penance, and haue
reported at their returne estrange visions of paine and blisse appearing vnto them.</p>
<p>The author of Polychronicon writeth that in the reigne of king Stephan, a knight
<note place="marg"><emph>Polychr. lib.</emph> 1. <emph>c.</emph> 36.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1138</date></note>
named Owen pilgrimaged to this purgatorie, being so appalled at the strange visions
that there he saw, as that vpon his returne from thense he was wholie mortified, and
sequestring himselfe from the world, he spent the remnant of his life in an abbeie
of Ludensis. Also Dyonisius a charterhouse moonke recordeth a vision seene in

his treatise written <emph>De quatuor nouissimis.</emph> Iohannes Camertes holdeth opinion,
which he surmiseth vpon the gesse of other, that Claudius writeth of this purgatorie.
Which if it be true, the place must haue b&eacute;ene extant before saint Patrike, but not
so famouslie knowen. The poet his verses are these following:

<cit>
<ref>Claud. lib. 1. in Ruffin.</ref>
<quote rend="block"><lg lang="la">
<l>"Est locus, extremum pandit qua Gallia littus,</l>

<l>"There is a place toward the ocean sea from brim of Gallish shore,</l>
<l>Wherein Vlysses pilgrim strange with offred bloud ygore,</l>
<l>The people there did mooue, a skritching shrill from dungeon lug</l>
<l>The dwellers all appall with gastlie galpe of grislie bug.</l>
<l>There onelie shapes are seene to stare with visage wan and sad,</l>
<l>From nouke to nouke, from place to place, in eluish skips to gad."</l>
</lg></quote>
</p>

<p>They that repaire to this place for deuotion his sake vse to continue therein foure &amp;
twentie houres, which dooing otherwhile with ghostlie meditations, and otherwhile a
dread for the conscience of their deserts, they saie they see a plaine resemblance of their
owne faults and vertues, with the horror and comfort therevnto belonging, the one
so terrible, the other so ioious, that they verelie d&eacute;eme themselues for the time to
haue sight of hell and heauen. The reuelations of men that went thither (S. Patrike
yet liuing) are kept written within the abbeie there adioining. When anie person is
<note place="marg">The ceremonies vsed in entering S. Patrike his purgatorie.</note>
disposed to enter (for the doore is euer spard) he repaireth first for deuise to the
archbishop, who casteth all pericles, and dissuadeth the pilgrime from the attempt,
bicause it is knowen that diuerse entering into that caue, neuer were seene to turne
backe againe. But if the partie be fullie resolued, he recommendeth him to the
prior, who in like maner fauourablie exhorteth him to choose some other kind of
penance, and not to hazard such a danger. If notwithstanding he find the partie
fullie bent, he conducteth him to the church, inioineth him to begin with praier
and fast of fift&eacute;ene daies, so long togither as in discretion can be indured. This
time expired, if yet he perseuere in his former purpose, the whole conuent accompanieth
him with solemne procession &amp; benediction to the mouth of the caue
where they let him in, and so bar vp the doore vntill the next morning. And then
with like ceremonies they await his returne and reduce him to the church. If he be
s&eacute;ene no more, they fast and praie fift&eacute;ene daies after. Touching the credit of these
matters, I s&eacute;e no cause, but a christian being persuaded that there is both hell and
heauen, may without vanitie vpon sufficient information be resolued, that it might
please God, at sometime, for considerations to his wisdome knowen, to reueale by
miracle the vision of ioies and paines eternall. But that altogither in such sort,

and by such maner, and so ordinarilie, and to such persons, as the common fame
dooth vtter; I neither bel&eacute;eue nor wish to be regarded. I haue conferd with
diuerse that had gone this pilgrimage, who affirmed the order of the premisses to
be true; but that they saw no sight, saue onelie fearefull dreams when they chanced
to nod, and those they said were exc&eacute;eding horrible. Further they added, that the
fast is rated more or lesse, according to the qualitie of the penitent.</p>
<p>Cambrensis affirmeth, that in the north of Mounster there be two Ilands, the
<note place="marg"><emph>Camb. lib.</emph> 1. <emph>topog. distinct.</emph> 2. <emph>rub.</emph> 5.</note>
greater and the lesse. In the greater there neuer entereth woman or anie liuing
female, but forthwith it dieth. This hath b&eacute;ene often prooued by bitches and cats,
which were brought thither to trie this conclusion, and presentlie they died. In
this Iland the cocke or mascle birds are seene to chirpe, and pearch vp and downe
the twigs, but the hen or female by instinct of nature abandoneth it, as a place
vtterlie poisoned. This Iland were a place alone for one that were vexed with a
shrewd wife. The lesse Iland is called <emph>Insula viuentium,</emph> bicause none died there,
<note place="marg">Insula viuentium.</note>
ne maie die by course of nature, as Giraldus Cambrensis saith. Howbeit the
dwellers when they are sore frusht with sicknesse, or so farre withered with age as
there is no hope of life, they request to be conueied by boate to the greater Iland,
where they are no sooner inshored, than they y&eacute;eld vp their ghosts. For my part,
I haue b&eacute;ene verie inquisitiue of this Iland, but I could neuer find this estrange
propertie soothed by anie man of credit in the whole countrie. Neither trulie
would I wish anie to be so light, as to lend his credit to anie such feined gloses, as
are neither verefied by experience, nor warranted by anie colourable reason. Wherfore
I see not why it should be termed <emph>Insula viuentium,</emph> vnlesse it be that none
dieth there, as long as he liueth.</p>
<p>Cambrensis telleth further, that there is a churchyard in Vlster, which no female
<note place="marg"><emph>Cambren. in codem loco.</emph></note>
kind maie enter. If the cocke be there, the hen dareth not follow. There is also
in the west part of Connaght an Iland, placed in the sea, called Aren, to which
<note place="marg">Aren.</note>
saint Brendan had often recourse. The dead bodies n&eacute;ed not in that Iland to be grauelled.
For the aire is so pure, that the contagion of anie canien maie not infect
it. There, as Cambrensis saith, maie the sonne s&eacute;e his father, his grandfather, his
great grandfather, &amp;c. This Iland is enimie to mice. For none is brought thither,
but either it leapeth into the sea, or else being staied it dieth presentlie. There was
in Kildare an ancient monument named the Firehouse, wherein Cambreasis saith,
<note place="marg">The Firehouse of Kildare.</note>
was there continuall fire kept day and night, and yet the ashes neuer increased. I
trauelled of set purpose to the towne of Kildare to s&eacute;e this place, where I did s&eacute;e

there shall be a bloudie field fought there, betw&eacute;ene the English inhabitants of

by it shall run foure and twentie houres with the streame of bloud that shall powre
downe from the hill. The Irish doubtlesse repose a great affiance in this balducktum

a mile of Castledermot, or Thristledermot, is there a place marked with two hillocks,
which is named the Geraldine his throw or cast. The length of which in
<note place="marg">The Geraldines throw.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1470.</date></note>
verie d&eacute;ed is woonderfull. The occasion proc&eacute;eded of this. One of the Geraldins,
who was ancestor to those that now are lords of Lackath, preded an enimie of his.
The earle of Kildare hauing intelligence therof, suppressing affection of kinred,
and mooned by zeale of iustice, pursued him with a great troope of horssemen, as
the other was bringing of the prede homeward. The Geraldine hauing notice giuen
him, that the earle was in hot pursute, and therefore being warned by the messenger
to hie him with all speed possible: the gentleman being nettled, that his
kinsman would s&eacute;eme to rescue the prede of his deadlie fo; and as he was in such
fretting wise frieng in his grease, he brake out in these cholerike words, "And
dooth my cousine Kildare pursue me in d&eacute;ed? Now in good faith, whereas he
s&eacute;emeth to be a suppresser of his kindred, and an vpholder of my mortall enimie, I
<note place="marg">The Geraldines wish.</note>
would wish him no more harme, than that this dart were as far in his bodie, as it
shall sticke foorthwith in the ground:" and therewithall giuing the spurres to his
horsse, he hurled his dart so farre, as he abashed with the length thereof aswell his
companie as his posteritie.</p>
<p>The Geraldine was not verie farre from thense, when the earle with his band
made hot foot after, and dogging still the tracke of the predours, he came to the
place where the dart was hurled, where one pickthanke or other let the earle to
vnderstand of the Geraldine his wild sp&eacute;eches there deliuered. And to inhanse the
heinousnesse of the offense, he shewed how farre he hurled his dart, when he
wished it to be pitched in his lordship his bodie. The erle astonied at the length
thereof, said: "Now in good sooth, my cousine in behauing himselfe so couragiouslie,
<note place="marg">The earle of Kildares answer</note>
is woorthie to haue the prede shot free. And for my part I purpose not so
much to stomach his cholerike wish, as to imbrace his valiant prowesse." And
therewithall commanded the retreat to be blowne and reculed backe. There is in
Meeth an hill called the hill of Taragh, wherein is a plaine twelue score long, which
<note place="marg">The hill of Taragh.</note>
was named the Kempe his hall: there the countrie had their m&eacute;etings and folkemotes,
as a place that was accounted the high palace of the monarch. The Irish
historians hammer manie fables in this forge of Fin mac Coile and his champions,
as the French historie dooth of king Arthur and the knights of the round table.
But doubtlesse the place s&eacute;emeth to beare the shew of an ancient and famous

put it in practise. Touching the strange wels that be in Ireland, I purpose to
speake litle more than that which I find in Cambrensis, whose words I will English,

there is a founteine in the further edge of Vlster, and if one be bathed therewith,
he shall not become hoare: in which well such as loath greie heares are accustomed
to diue. There is in Connaght a well that springeth on the top of an hill farre and
distant from anie sea, ebbing and flowing in foure and twentie houres, as the sea
dooth; and yet the place is vplandish, and the water fresh. There is another
spring in the same countrie, the water of which is verie wholsome to men and
women, but poison to beasts: and if a man but put the grauell of this well into his

<p>There is in Vlster a standing poole thirtie thousand pases long, and fift&eacute;ene
thousand pases brode, out of which springeth the noble northerne riuer, called the
Banne. The fishers complaine more often for bursting of their nets with the ouer
great lake of fish, than for anie want. In our time vpon the conquest a fish swam
from this poole to the shore, in shape resembling a salmon, but in quantitie so huge,
that it could not be drawne or caried wholie togither, but the fishmongers were
forced to hacke it in gobbets, and so to carrie it in peecemeale throughout the
countrie, making thereof a generall dole. And if the report be true, the beginning
of this poole was strange. There were in old time where the poole now standeth,
vicious and beastlie inhabitants. At which time was there an old said saw in euerie
man his mouth, that as soone as a well there springing (which for the superstitious
reuerence they bare it, was continuallie couered and signed) were left open and
vnsigned, so soone would so much water gush out of that well, as would foorthwith
ouerwhelme the whole territorie. It happened at length, that an old trot came
thither to fetch water, and hearing hir child whine, she ran with might and maine
to dandle hir babie, forgetting the obseruance of the superstitious order tofore vsed.
But as she was returning backe to haue couered the spring, the land was so farre
ouerflowne, as that it past hir helpe: and shortlie after she, hir suckling, &amp; all
those that were within the whole territorie were drowned. And this s&eacute;emeth to
carie more likelihood with it, bicause the fishers in a cleare sunnie daie see the
st&eacute;eples and other piles plainlie and distinctlie in the water. And here would be
noted, that the riuer of the Banne flowed from this head spring before this floud,
but farre in lesse quantitie than it dooth in our time. Hitherto Giraldus Cambrensis.</p>
<p>Boetius telleth a rare propertie of a poole in Ireland, &amp; for that he maketh himselfe
<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boet. in Scot. reg. descript. pag.</emph> 9. <emph>Sect.</emph> 50.</note>
an eiewitnesse of the matter, he shall tell his owne tale. "Ac quoniam Hiberni&aelig;
incidit mentio, pr&aelig;ter infinita in ea rerum miracula, haud importunum fore
existimem, si vnum, quod ob portentuosam nouitatem fidem omnium excedere
videatur, nos tamen verum experti sumus, adiunxerimus. Lacus in ea est, circa
quem amplissimo circumquaque spatio nec herba nec arbor vlla nascitur, &amp;c: in
quem si lignum infigas anni circiter vnius curriculo, id quod in terra fixum erit, in
lapidem conuertetur; quod deinceps aqu&acirc; operietur, in ferrum: reliquum aqu&acirc;
exstans ligni formam natur&aacute;mque seruabit. Ita coniuncta, lapis, ferrum &amp; lignum
eodem in stipite inaudita nouitate conspectantur." But for that mention is made
of Ireland, ouer and aboue the infinite number of woonders in that land, it will not
be wholie beside the purpose, to insert one maruellous thing, which although it
may seeme to some to haue no colour of truth: yet because it hath beene by vs
experimented, and found out to be true, we maie the better aduouch it. There is
a standing poole in that Iland, neere which of all sides groweth neither herbe, shrub,
nor bush. If you sticke a rod or p&eacute;ece of timber in this poole, that which sticketh
in the earth within the space of one yeare turneth to a stone; as much as is dipt in
the water, is conuerted to iron; all that is aboue the water remaineth still in the
pristinat and former woodden shape. So that you may s&eacute;e that which is strange,
in one stocke or sticke, stone, iron and wood linkt and knit togither. Thus much
Hector Boetius.</p>
<p>In the countrie of Kilkennie and in the borders thereto confining, they vsed a

<note place="marg">Melash&eacute;e.</note>
say, that if a periured person drinke thereof, the water will gush out at his bellie,
as though the drinker his nauill were bord with an auger. The riuer that runneth

such a sudden spring flow, as if the former raine were great; a verie few places or
none at all will be found pasable. Cambrensis writeth, that in the south part of
<note place="marg"><emph>Cambr. lib.</emph> 1. <emph>dist.</emph> 2. <emph>rub.</emph> 41.</note>
Mounster, betw&eacute;ene the maine sea coasting on Hispaine and saint Brendan his hills,
there is an Iland of the one side incompassed with a riuer abundantlie stored with
fish, &amp; on the other part inclosed with a little brooke. In which place saint
Brendan was verie much resiant. This plot is taken to be such a sanctuarie for
beasts, as if anie hare, fox, stag, or other wild beast be chased n&eacute;ere that Iland by
dogs, it maketh straight vpon the brooke, and assoone as it passeth the streame, it
is so cockesure, as the hunter may perceiue the beast resting on the one banke, &amp;
the dogs questing on the other brim, being as it were by some inuisible railes
imbard from dipping their f&eacute;et in the shallow foord, to pursue the beast chased.
On the other side of this Iland there runneth a riuer stored aboue measure with
fresh water fish, and in especiallie with salmon. Which abundance, as Cambrensis
writeth, proc&eacute;eded of God, to mainteine the great hospitalitie that was kept there.
And because the dwellers thereabout shall not like pinching coistrels make anie sale
of the fish, let it be poudered as artificiallie as may be, yet it will not k&eacute;epe (as
though it were manna) aboue the first night or daie that it be taken. So that you
must eate it within that short compasse, otherwise it putrifieth and standeth to no
st&eacute;ed.</p>
<p>This riuer ouerfloweth a great rocke, vsuallie called the Salmon leape: for as it
<note place="marg">The Salmon leape.</note>
is commonlie the propertie of all fish to swim against the tide, as for birds to flitter
against the wind; so it is naturallie giuen to the salmon to struggle against the
streme, and when it approcheth neere this high rocke, it bendeth his taile to his
head, and sometime taketh it in his mouth; and therewithall beareth it selfe ouer
the water, and suddenlie it fetcheth such a round whiske, that at a trice it skippeth
to the top of the rocke. The like salmon leape is n&eacute;ere Leislip, but not so high as
this. There be also, as witnesseth Cambrensis, in the further part of Vlster, certeine
hils n&eacute;ere to saint Bean his church, where cranes yearelie br&eacute;ed. And when
they haue laied their egs, if anie purpose to ransacke their nests, let him but attempt
to touch the egs, they will shew like yoong scralling pullets without feather or
downe, as though they were new hatched, and presentlie brought out of their shels.
But if the partie plucke his hand from the nest, forthwith they shew (whether it be
by anie metamorphosis, or some iugling legier de maine by dazeling the eies) as
though they were transformed into egs. And further, saith Cambrensis, let two
at one instance be at the nest, and let the one of them onelie giue the gaze, and
the other attempt to take awaie the egs, they will s&eacute;eme to the looker on as egs,
and to the taker as yoong red little cranets, being as bare as a bird his arsse.</p>
<p>The towne of Armagh is said to be enimie to rats, and if anie be brought thither,
<note place="marg">Armagh.</note>
presentlie it dieth. Which the inhabitants impute to the praiers of saint Patrike.
But to omit the strange places, that either by false reports are surmised, or by
proofe and experience dailie verefied: there are in this Iland such notable quaries
of greie marble and touch, such store of pearle and other rich stones, such abundance
of cole, such plentie of lead, iron, latin and tin, so manie rich mines furnished

<p>THE spirituall iurisdiction is ordered into foure prouinces, whereof the primasie
was euer giuen (in reuerence of saint Patrike that conuerted the countrie) to the

of Dublin, <emph>Primas Hiberni&oelig;.</emph> This custome was since confirmd by Eugenius the

placed, one at Dublin, one at Cashill, &amp; the last at Twene. To these are suffragans
in right nine and twentie, and they all to the <emph>Primas</emph> of Armagh, vnder whose

some difference hapneth by reason of personall and reall vnion of the sees, and for

bishops and archbishops of Dublin: and albeit I could not find a iust register or
catalog of them, yet I tooke it to be better to place such as I could find, than to
omit the whole. &para; Cormachus was one of the first bishops that I haue read of, but
I am well assured, that there were diuerse others before his time. He flourished

was bishop of Dublin long after Cormachus: for Dunanus died in the yeare 1074.
He was buried in Christs church in Dublin, in the vpper part of the chancell on the

<p>&para; Patricius was consecrated bishop of Dublin in Paule his church at London by
<note place="marg"><date>1074.</date></note>
the archbishop of Canturburie Lanifranus or Lanfrancus. The reason of this consecration
was, for that as yet the metropolitans of Ireland receiued not their pall. A
pall is an indowment appropriated to archbishops, made of white silke the breadth
<note place="marg">Pall what it is.</note>
of a stole, but it is of another fashion. And where you shall espie the armes of anie
archbishop blazed, there you may perceiue the pall set out in white, with a great
manie blacke crosses vpon it. An archbishop within thr&eacute;e moneths after his consecration

prouinces; albeit in another prouince he may be in his pontificalibus, so that pontificalia
differeth from the pall. Furthermore, an archbishop may not lend his pall
vnto another, but it ought to be interred with him. But to returne to Patricius,
his time was but short, for soone after as he was crossing the seas to Dublin ward,
he was drowned with his felow passengers the same yere that he was consecrated,
the ninth of October.</p>

Gelacius the primat of Armagh, and not by Canturburie, as the bishops of Dublin
were before the pall giuen them. He died in Normandie, and was buried in our

<p>Iohan Cummin an Englishman succ&eacute;eded Laurence. This famous prelat being
cloistered vp in the abbeie of Eusham in Worcestershire was highlie renowmed of
all men, as well for his d&eacute;epe learning, as for the integritie of his life. The clergie
of Dublin being giuen to vnderstand of so woorthie a clerke, became humble petitioners
to the king his maiestie Henrie the second, that through his means such an

their earnest sute agr&eacute;ed he should be consecrated their archbishop; which was an
happie houre for that countrie. For besides the great trauell he indured in edifieng

as is before specified. He deceassed in the y&eacute;ere one thousand two hundred and

<p>Henrie Londres succ&eacute;eded Cummin. This man was nicknamed Scorchbill, or
Scorchvillein thorough this occasion. Being setled in his s&eacute;e, he gaue commandement
to all his tenants to make their appeerance before him at a daie appointed:
and for that he was raw as yet in his reuenues, he tooke it to stand best with their
ease and quietnes, and his commoditie, that ech of them should shew their euidences,
whereby he might learne, by what tenure they held of him. His tenants
mistrusting no sluttish dealing, but construing all to be meant for the best, deliuered
their euidences to their landlord, who did scantlie well peruse them when he
floong them all in the fire. The poore tenants espieng this subtill pranke to be verie
vnfitting for a bishop, could not bridle their toongs, but brake out on a sudden:
Thou an archbishop? Naie, thou art a scorchvillein. But it could not be gessed to

what end this fact of his tended; for notwithstanding this, the tenants inioied their
lands, vnlesse he did it because they should be tenants at will, and so to stand to his
deuotion. This prelat doubtlesse was politike, and well lettered, and for his wisedome
and learning he was elected lord iustice of Ireland. He was the founder of
the castell of Dublin, as is before mentioned. He deceassed in the yeare one thousand

<p>Richard de Hauerings was successor vnto Flerings, who after that he had continued
weln&eacute;ere the space of fiue yeares in the see, was sore appalled, by reason of
an estrange and woonderfull dreame. For on a certeine night he imagined that he
had s&eacute;ene an vglie monster standing on his breast, who to his thinking was more
weightie than the whole world, in so much as being as he thought in manner squised
or prest to death with the heff of this huge monster, he would haue departed with
the whole substance of the world, if he were thereof possessed, to be disburdened
of so heauie a load. Upon which wish he suddenlie awooke. And as he beat his
braines in diuining what this dreame should import, he bethought himselfe of the
<note place="marg">Hauerings dreame.</note>
flocke committed to his charge, how that he gathered their fl&eacute;eces yearelie, by receiuing
the reuenues and perquisits of the bishoprike, and yet suffered his flocke to
starue for lacke of preaching and teaching. Wherefore being for his former slacknesse
sore wounded in conscience, he trauelled with all sp&eacute;ed to Rome, where he
resigned vp his bishoprike, a burthen too heauie for his weake shoulders, and being
vpon his resignation competentlie beneficed, he bestowed the remnant of his life
wholie in deuotion.</p>
<p>Iohan Lech nephue to Hauerings, vpon the resignation was consecrated archbishop.
<note place="marg"><date>1311.</date></note>
This prelat was at contention with the primat of Armagh, for their iurisdictions:
insomuch as he did imbarre the primat from hauing his crosse borne before
him within the prouince of Leinster, which was contrarie to the canon law, that
<note place="marg"><emph>De priui. &amp; excest. pri. c. Archiep.</emph></note>
admitteth the crosier to beare the crosse before his archbishop in an other
prouince. This man deceassed in the yeare one thousand thr&eacute;e hundred and thirt&eacute;ene.</p>
<p>Alexander
Bigenor was next Lech consecrated archbishop with the whole consent
<note place="marg"><date>1313.</date></note>
aswell of the chapter of Christs church as of S. Patriks. Howbeit vpon the
death of Lech there arose a schisme &amp; diuision betw&eacute;ene Walter Thorneburie lord
chancellour of Ireland and Bigenor then treasuror of the same countrie. The
cancellor to further his election determined to haue posted to Rome, but in the
waie he was drowned with the number of 156 passengers. Bigenor staieng in Ireland,
with lesse aduenture and better sp&eacute;ed, with the consent of both the chapters
was elected archbishop. And in the yeare 1317 there came buls from Rome to
confirme the former election. At which time the archbishop and the earle of Vlster
were in England. This prelat soone after returned lord iustice of Ireland, and
<note place="marg"><date>1318</date></note>
soone after he had landed at Yoghill, he went to Dublin, where as well for his spilituall
iurisdiction, as his temporall promotion he was receiued with procession and
great solemnitie. In this man his time was there an vniuersitie founded in Dublin,
<note place="marg"><date>1320</date></note>
whereof maister William Rodiard was chancellor, a well learned man and one that
proc&eacute;eded doctor of the canon law in this vniuersitie. Bigenor deceased in the

prince of Wales by Nesta the moother of Maurice Fitzgerald &amp; Robert Fitzstephans,

sonnet of Surreies, made vpon the earle of Kildares sister, now countesse of Lincolne.

</lg></quote></p>


<p>The corrupt orthographic that diuerse vse in writing this name, dooth incorporat
it to houses thereto linked in no kinred, and consequentlie blemisheth diuerse
worthie exploits atchiued as well in England and Ireland, as in forren countries
and dominions. Some write Gerold, sundrie Gerald, diuerse verie corruptlie
Gerrot, others Gerard. But the true orthographie is Girald, as maie appeare both
by Giraldus Cambrensis, and the Italian authors that make mention of the familie.
As for Gerrot it differeth flat from Girald: yet there be some in Ireland, that
name and write themselues Gerrots, notwithstanding they be Giraldins, whereof
diuerse gentlemen are in Meeth. But there is a sept of the Gerrots in Ireland,
and they s&eacute;eme forsooth by threatning kindnesse and kindred of the true Giraldins,
to fetch their petit degrees from their ancestors, but they are so n&eacute;ere of bloud one
to the other, that two bushels of beanes would scantlie count their degr&eacute;es. An
other reason why diuerse estrange houses haue b&eacute;ene shuffled in among this familie,
was, for that sundrie gentlemen at the christening of their children, would haue
them named Giralds, and yet their surnames were of other houses, and if after it
happened that Girald had issue Thomas, Iohn, Robert, or such like, then would
they beare the surname of Girald, as Thomas Fitzgirald: and thus taking the
name of their ancestors for their surname, within two or thr&eacute;e descents they shooue
themselues among the kindred of the Giraldins. This is a generall fault in Ireland
and Wales, and a great confusion and extinguishment of houses.</p>
<p>This noble and ancient familie of the Giraldins, haue in sundrie ages florished

credit with King Iohn. I find an other Giraldine <emph>Archiepiscopus Burdegalensis,</emph> who
<note place="marg"><date>1234</date></note>
flourished in king Henrie the third his time. There was an other Giraldine patriarch
of Ierusalem, in the y&eacute;ere one thousand two hundred twentie and nine, as
witnesseth Matth&aelig;us Parisiensis. There was one Girald of Berneill an excellent
<note place="marg"><emph>Pag.</emph> 480.</note>
poet in the Italian toong: an other named Baptist Girald, was a famous citizen
of Ferrara, an expert physician, and an exquisit philosopher, being publike professor
of philosophie in the said citie, during the space of ten yeares. I haue
seene a worke of one <emph>Gregorius Giraldus Ferrariensis de digs gentium,</emph> dedicated to
Hercules duke of Ferrara, a pithie booke and verie well penned. Also Syluester
Giraldus Cambrensis hath b&eacute;ene one of this familie, n&eacute;ere of kin to sir Maurice
<note place="marg">Giraldus Cambrensis.</note>
Fitzgirald. This gentleman was borne in Wales, and thereof he is named Cambrensis,
of the word <emph>Cambria,</emph> that in old time was adapted to that part of <emph>Britannia.</emph>
He was verie inward with Henrie the second, conqueror of Ireland, being
at that time the kings secretarie. And for that speciall affiance king Henrie reposed
in him, he was appointed to accompanie prince Iohn the kings sonne into Ireland,
as one of his chiefest and discr&eacute;etest councellors.</p>
<p>This gentleman was verie well learned, a tolerable diuine, a commendable philosopher,
not rude in physike, skilfull in cosmographie, a singular good antiquarie,
an orator, in indeuor comparable to the best, in his stile not in those daies taken
for the woorst, rather eschewing the name of a rude writer, than purchasing the
fame of an eloquent chronicler. Among other his works, he wrote one booke of
<note place="marg"><emph>Ioannes de loco frumenti part prima granarij.</emph></note>
the description of Ireland, other two of the conquest thereof. Iohn the abbat of
saint Albons saith, that this clerke was somewhat spare in words, and liberall in
sentences. What he meaneth by this verdict I know not, vnlesse he taketh the
man to be ouerlauish of his pen in frumping of his aduersaries with quipping
tawnts, which (as I gesse) flowed rather from a flanting ostentation of a roisting
kind of rhetorike, than from anie great malice he bare anie one. Howbeit, I maie
not gainesaie, but as he was kind where he tooke, so he was somewhat biting
where he disliked. But what his iudgement is of the Giraldins maie plainlie appeare
in his chronicle, out of which I haue culled this praiseworthie sentence insuing.</p>

Cambrensis, a destinie or fatall propertie annexed to this house. In warre and
martiall broiles they are dandaled, they are colled, they are lulled, who but they?
They rule the rost. But when these martiall garboiles are appeased, they are either
through false informations wrongfullie behated, or else by enuious carpers sinisterlie

the good fortune of the Giraldines, that the king with equall balance would poise
their valure, long yer this had all Ireland beene put in quiet and peaceable staie.
But their valiantnesse and power hath beene from time to time without sufficient
cause suspected. Hitherto Cambrensis.</p>
<p>And soothlie, as often as I call to mind the saieng of this historiographer, I
may not but muse how iumpe he hitteth the naile on the head. And who so will
conferre their continuall successe from the penning of this sentence (which was
written aboue 400 yeares and vpward) with this age of ours, shall soone perceiue,
that these words were rather prophesies of future mishap, than complaints of former
iniuries. At this daie let them behaue themselues valiantlie in warre, and
loiallie in peace; yet notwithstanding, such slanders are raised, such rumors
noised, such tales bruted, such fables twitled, such vntrue reports twatled, such
malicious inuentions forged, that such as are in authoritie cannot but of force suspect
them, vnlesse they were able, like gods, to prie in the bottome of each mans
conscience. But who so wisheth anie goodnesse to that miserable countrie, and
noble progenie, let him with all the veines of his heart bes&eacute;ech God, first that the
higher powers be slowe in bel&eacute;euing the despitefull reports of enuious backbiters.
Secondlie, that the Giraldines beare themselues in all their affaires so dutifullie,
that these curious inserchers be not able to depaint their feigned gloses with anie
probable colours. So shall suspicion be abandoned, so shall malicious slanders be
squatted, so shall that noble house be trusted, and consequentlie the battered
weale-publike of Ireland reedified. The familie is English, and it is well knowne
that the Irish rather feare their force, than loue their persons. And reason good
pardie. For the Irish bearing in mind, that the Giraldine being thereto deputed
by the prince, hath in all ages conquered their lands, abated their courages, discomfited
their men, vanquished their armies, daunted their power, suppressed
their force, and made them become true and tributarie subiects to the crowne of
England: they haue good cause to beare that sept but holow hearts, what shew so
euer they make in outward apperance. Thus much generallie of the Giraldines,
now I purpose particularlie to treat of the house of Kildare.</p>
<p>Maurice Fitzgirald, one of the earles progenitors, was lord iustice of Ireland in
the yeare 1242, at which time he builded the castell of Sligagh. This Maurice
was lord of Tireconille, and being entirelie seized of the whole countrie, he gaue

<note place="marg">Baron of Ophalie.</note>
the one moietie thereof to Cormocke mac Dermot, mac Rorie. I read the Giraldine
baron of Ophalie, in the yeare 1270. I haue s&eacute;ene it registred, that there
died a Giraldine the fourth earle of Kildare, in the yeare 1287. But I take that
kalendar to beare a false date. Wherefore the truth &amp; certeintie is, that Iohn
Fitzgirald, sonne to Thomas Fitzgirald, was the first earle of Kildare, and was
<note place="marg">The first erle of Kildare.</note>
created earle vpon this occasion.</p>

<note place="marg">Vescie lord iustice.</note>
Vescie was made lord iustice of Ireland. This man being either negligent or raw
in the gouernment of the countrie, emboldened the Irish enimie to indamage the
kings subiects more effsoones than they were accustomed to doo. These enormities
being for the space of foure yeares tolerated, the subiects misliking of the
slacknesse of their gouernour, gave out such sinister sp&eacute;eches of the lord iustice,
as he was glad to the hart root. Soone after, as the nobles in open assemblie were
ripping vp by p&eacute;ecemele the seuerall harms their tenants suffered, the lord iustice
<note place="marg">Vescie accuseth the lord Fitzgirald.</note>
willing to disburden himselfe of the crime, began with mistie kind of speaches to
laie the whole fault on the lord Iohn Fitzgiralds shoulders, saieng in parable wise,
that he was a great occasion of these disorders, in that he bare himselfe in priuat
quarrels as fierce as a lion, but in these publike iniuries he was as m&eacute;eke as a lambe.

The baron of Ophalie spelling and putting these syllables together, spake in this
wise.</p>
<p>"My lord, I am hartilie sorie that among all this noble assemblie, you make me
<note place="marg">The lord Giralds answer.</note>
your onelie marke whereat to shoot your bolt. And trulie were my deserts so heinous
as I suppose you would wish them to be, you would not labour to cloud your
talke with such darke ridles, as at this present you haue doone; but with plaine &amp;
flat English, your lordship would not sticke to impeach of fellonie or treason. For
as mine ancestors with spending of their bloud in their souereignes quarell aspired
to this type of honour, in which at this daie (God and my king be thanked) I
stand: so your lordship taking the nigher waie to the wood, by charging me with
treason, would gladlie trip so roundlie on my top, that by shedding of my bloud,
and by catching my lands into your clouches, that butt so neere vpon your manors
of Kildare and Rathimgan, as I dare saie they are an eie-sore vnto you, you might
make my maister your sonne a proper gentleman."</p>
<p>"A gentleman?" quoth the lord iustice: "Thou bald baron, I tell thee the
<note place="marg">The lord iustice replieth.</note>
Vescies were gentlemen before the Giraldines were barons of Ophalie, yea and before
that Welsh bankrupt thine ancestour (he meant sir Maurice Fitzgirald) fethered
his nest in Leinster. And whereas thou takest the matter so farre in snuffe, I will
teach th&eacute;e thy lyrripups after an other fashion than to be thus malepertlie cocking
and billing with me that am thy gouernour. Wherefore, albeit thy taunts are such
as they might force the patientest philosopher that is, to be chokt with choler:
yet I would haue th&eacute;e ponder my sp&eacute;eches, as though I deliuered them in my
most sober and quiet mood. I saie to the face of th&eacute;e, and I will auow what I say
vnto th&eacute;e, that thou art a supporter of theeues, a bolsterer of the kings enimies,
an vpholder of traitors, a murtherer of subiects, a firebrand of dissention, a ranke
th&eacute;efe, an arrant traitor: and before I eate these words, I will make th&eacute;e eate a
p&eacute;ece of my blade."</p>
<p>The baron brideling with might and maine his choler, bare himselfe as cold in
countenance, as the lord iustice was hot in words, and replied in this wise. "My
lord I am verie glad, that at length you vnwrapped your selfe out of that net,
wherein all this while you masked. As for mine ancestor, whome you terme a
bankerupt, how rich or how poore he was vpon his repaire to Ireland, I purpose not
at this time to debate. Yet thus much I may boldlie saie, that he came hither as a
bier, not as a begger. He bought the enimies land by spending his bloud: but
you lurking like a spider in his copweb to intrap flies, endeuor to beg subiects liuings
wrongfullie, by despoiling them of their innocent liues. And wheras you
charge me with malepertnes, in that I presume to chop logike with you being gouernour,
by answering your snappish <emph>Quid,</emph> with a knappish <emph>Quo,</emph> I wold wish you
to vnderstand, now, that you put me in mind of the distinction, that I as a subiect
honour your roiall authoritie, but as a noble man I despise your dunghill gentilitie.
Lastlie, whereas you charge me with the odious termes of traitor, murtherer,
and the like, and there withall you wish me to resolue my selfe that you
rest vpon reason, not vpon rage: if these words proc&eacute;ed from your lordship, as
from a magistrate, I am a subiect, to be tried by order of law, and am sorrie that
the gouernour, who ought by vertue of his publike authoritie to be my iudge, is
by reason of priuat malice become mine accuser.</p>
<p>"But if you vtter these sp&eacute;eches as a priuat person, then I Iohn Fitzgirald, baron
of Ophalie, doo tell th&eacute;e William Vescie, a single sole gentleman, that I am no
traitor, no felon; and that thou art the onelie buttresse, by which the kings enimies
are supported, the meane and instrument by which his maiesties subiects are
dailie spoiled. Therefore I as a loiall subiect saie traitor to thy t&eacute;eth, and that shalt

ters before our betters. Howbeit, during the time you beare office, I am resolued
to giue you the mastrie in words, and to suffer you like a bralling our to barke, but
when I s&eacute;e my time I will be sure to bite."</p>
<p>These biting sp&eacute;eches passing to and fro, great factions on both sides were raised,
<note place="marg">The lord Girald posteth into England.</note>
with high and mightie words, and deepe othes; till time either part appeased his
owne. The baron of Ophalie not sl&eacute;eping nor slacking his matter, squdded with
all hast into England, where he was no sooner inshored, than Vescie, after he had
substituted William Haie in his roome, was imbarked, making as hot foot after the
<note place="marg">Vescie followeth</note>
baron as he could. The king and his councell vnderstanding the occasion of their
sudden arriuals, to the end the truth should be brought to light, appointed a set
daie for the deciding of their controuersie, and that each of them should speake
for himselfe what he could. Wherevpon Vescie being commanded to begin, spake
to this effect.</p>
<p>"My dread souereigne, as I must acknowledge my selfe somewhat agr&eacute;eued, to
<note place="marg">Vescies oration.</note>
be intangled in so intricate a matter, so I am as glad as hart can thinke that so
weightie a controuersie is brought to the deciding of so vpright an vmpire. And
whereas it stood with your maiesties pleasure, with the aduise of this your honourable
councell, that I, as vnwoorthie, should haue the gouernment of your realme
of Ireland; and during my time, your maiesties subjects, haue b&eacute;ene, I may not
denie it, diuerslie annoied, for my discharge, as I said in Ireland: so I auow h&eacute;ere
in England, that he kneeleth heere before your highnesse (pointing to the baron of
Ophalie) that is the root and crop of all these enormities. For it is well knowne,
that he beareth that stroke with the Irish, as if he once but frowne at them, they
dare not be so hardie as once to peake out of their cabbins. And whereas his force
dooth greatlie amaze them, thinke you but his countenance dooth woonderfullie incourage
them? To the furtherance of which, it is apparantlie knowne, and it shall
be prooued, that he hath not onelie in hucker mucker, by sundrie messages imboldened
your maiesties enimies, to spoile your subiects, but also by his personall
presence, in secret m&eacute;etings, he gaue them such courage, as neither the roialtie of
your highnesse, nor the authoritie of your deputie, neither the force of your
lawes, nor the strength of your puissant armie, was able to quench the flame of
these hurlie burlies, that through his traitorous driffs were inkindled. These and
the like enormities through his priuie packing with rebels being dailie committed,
to bring me your maiesties gouernour in the hatred of the people, his adherents
both secretlie muttered, and openlie exclamed against me and my gouernment, as
though the redresse of all these harmes had wholie lien in mine hands.</p>

of Ireland, albeit I tooke it to be expedient, to point with my finger to the verie
sinke or headspring of all the treasons, that by secret conspiracies were pretended
and practised against your maiestie and your subiects, yet notwithstanding hauing
more regard to modestie, than to the deserts of the baron of Ophalie, I did but
glanse at his packing in such secret sort, as none or a verie few of the companie
could gesse, whome with my mistie speaches I did touch. And as commonlie the
gald horsse dooth soonest kicke, so this gentelman being prickt, as it should seeme
with the sting of his giltie conscience, brake out on a sudden, and forgetting his
allegiance to your highnesse, and his dutie to me your deputie, he tooke me vp so
roughlie, as though I had b&eacute;ene rather his vnderling than his gouernour. The
summe of which despitefull speaches I refer to the testimonie of the honorable audience
where they were deliuered. As for his manifold treasons, I am ashamed to
rehearse such things as he did not sticke to commit. And if it shall stand with
your maiesties pleasure, to adiourne the triall for a few daies, I will charge him with

anie one article that shall be booked against him." When Vescie had ended, the
baron of Ophalie prest himselfe somewhat forward, and in this wise spake.</p>
<p>"Most puissant prince and my dread souereigne, were maister Vescie his mouth
<note place="marg">The lord Giralds oration.</note>
so iust a measure, as what he spake, should be holden for gospell, this had b&eacute;ene no
fit place for so arrant a traitor, as he with his feigned glosing would gladlie prooue
me to be. But sith it pleased your maiestie, with so indifferent balance to ponder
both our tales, I am throughlie persuaded, that my loiall innocencie shall be able,
to ouerpoise his forged treacherie. Your maiestie hath heard manie words to small
purpose. And as his complaint hitherto hath beene generallie hudled vp, so mine
answer thereto may not particularlie be framed. Whereas therefore he termeth me
a supporter of th&eacute;eues, a packer with rebels, a conspirator with traitors, if I should
but with a bare word denie the premisses, all his gaie glose of glitring speaches
would suddenlie fade awaie. Yea, but he craueth respit for the booking of his
articles. Trulie so he hath need. For loitering and lingring is the onlie waie he
may deuise to cloke his feigning and forging. Wherin he sheweth himselfe as
craftie, as the philosopher was accounted wise that promised a tyrant vpon menacing
wordes, to schoole his asse in philosophie, so he had seuen yeares respit; bicause
that in that space he was persuaded, that either the tyrant, the asse, or he would
die. In likewise master Vescie, vpon respit granted him, would hang in hope, that
either the life of your maiestie (which God forbid) should be shortened; or that I,
in tract of time, would be disfauoured; or that he by one subtill pranke or other
should be of this heauie load disburdened.</p>
<p>"But if I haue b&eacute;ene as manie yeares a malefactor as he aduoucheth, how happeneth
it, that his toong was tied before this late dissention begun? Whie did he not
from time to time aduertise the councell of my treasons? Whereas now it may be
probablie coniectured, that he was egd to this seruice rather for the hatred he beareth
me, than for anie loue he oweth your roiall maiestie. Touching the words I
spake in Ireland, I purpose not, for ought I heard as yet, to eat them in England.
And when I shall be cald to testifie such speaches as I deliuered there, I will not be
found so raw in my matter, as to lose my errant in the carriage, as master Vescie
hath doone, or to craue further respit for the registring of his manifold treasons.
As for my secret m&eacute;etings with Irish rebels, where I persuaded master Vescie, that
you were able to prooue them, I would be found willing to acknowledge them.
For if my conscience were so deepelie stoong, as you pretend, I would take it for
better policie, by acknowledging my trespasse, to appeale to my king his mercie,
than by denieng my faults, to stand to the rigor of his iustice.</p>
<p>"And as for m&eacute;etings, I had neuer so manie in woods with rebels, as you master
Vescie, haue had in your chamber with cowes. For it hath beene manifestlie apparented,
that when the baron of Ophalie, and the best of the nobilitie of Ireland
haue b&eacute;ene imbard from entring your chamber, an Irish cow should haue at all times
accesse vnto you. No, master Vescie: a cow, an horsse, an hauke, and a siluer
cup haue beene the occasion of your slacknesse. When the subiects were preided,
you would be content to winke at their miserie, so that your mouth were stopt
with briberie. And when you had gathered your crums sufficientlie togither, you
held it for a pretie policie (and yet it was but a bare shift) to charge the nobilitie
with such packing, as you dailie did practise. But you must not thinke that we
are babes, or that with anie such stale deuise, or grosse iuggling tricke, you may
so easilie duske or dazell our eies. Can anie man that is but slenderlie witted, so far
be caried, as to beleeue, that master Vescie, being the kings deputie in Ireland,
hauing his maiesties treasure, hauing the nobilitie at his becke, the kings armie
at his commandement; but that, if he were disposed to besturre himselfe, he were
able to ferret out such barebr&eacute;ech brats as swarme in the English pale? If he said

he could not, we must smile at his simplicitie; if he could and would not, how may
he colour his disloialtie?</p>
<p>"Yea, but I beare such stroke with the Irish, as that vpon anie priuat quarrell I
am able to annoie them. What then? Bicause the baron of Ophalie can reuenge
his priuat iniuries without the assistance of the deputie; therefore the deputie may
not vanquish weake and naked rebels without the furtherance of the baron of
Ophalie: whereas the contrarie ought to be inferd, that if a priuat person can tame
the Irish, what may then the publike magistrat doo, that hath the princes paie?
But in d&eacute;ed it is hard to take hares with foxes. You must not thinke, master
Vescie, that you were sent gouernour into Ireland to dandle your truls, to pen your
selfe vp within a towne or citie to giue rebels the gaze, to pill the subiects, to
animat tratiors, to fill your coffers, to make your selfe by marring true men, to
gather the birds whilest other beat the bushes, and after to impeach the nobilitie
of such treasons, as you onelie haue committed.</p>
<p>"But for so much as our mutuall complaints stand vpon the one his yea, and the
other his naie, and that you would be taken for a champion, &amp; I am knowne to be
no coward: let vs, in Gods name, leaue lieng for varlets, berding for ruffians,
facing for crakers, chatting for twatlers, scolding for callets, booking for scriueners,

<p>Now in good faith, quoth Vescie, with a right good will. Wherevpon both the
parties being dismist vntill the kings pleasure were further knowne, it was agr&eacute;ed
at length by the councell, that the fittest triall should haue b&eacute;ene by battell.
Wherefore the parties being as well thereof aduertised, as the daie by the king
appointed, no small prouision was made for so eager a combat, as that was presupposed
to haue beene. But when the prefixed daie approched n&eacute;ere, Vescie turning

English gentlemen, and worthie seruitors in all ages. Theobald Butler lord of
Carrike and Iohn Cogan were lord iustices of Ireland. This Butler died in the
castell of Arckelow, in the yeare 1285. This lord Theobald Butler the yoonger,
and son to the elder Theobald, was sent for by Edward the first, to serue against
the Scots. This noble man deceased at Turuie, and his bodie was conueighed to
Weneie, a towne in the countie of Limerike. Sir Edmund Butler a wise and valiant
noble man was dubbed knight at London by Edward the second.</p>
<p>This man being appointed lieutenant of Ireland, vpon the repaire of Iohn Wogan

were it not that they submitted themselues to the king and the lieutenants mercie,
they had not b&eacute;ene onelie for a season vanquished, but also vtterlie by him extirped.
This noble man was in his gouernement such an incourager and furtherer of
seruitors, as that he dubd on saint Michaell the archangels daie thirtie knights in
<note place="marg"><date>1313</date></note>
the castell of Dublin. He was a scourge vnto the Scots that inuaded Ireland, when
he was lieutenant. He discomfited Omourgh a notorious rebell, neare a towne

named Balie lethan. After diuerse victorious exploits by him atchiued, he sailed

Butler, in recompense of the death of Thomas of Canturburie their kinsman. His

excell, a greie frier profest, verie well s&eacute;ene in logike, deepelie grounded in
philosophie, both morall &amp; naturall, learned in the metaphysiks, in diuinitie p&eacute;erelesse.
Scantlie maie I tell with how great courtesie &amp; vertue he was indued. When
he had professed at Padua the liberall arts manie yeares with no small renowme; he
was created by Iulius the second, not onelie for his profound knowledge, but also
for the sinceritie of his life, archbishop of Tuen. When he was trauelling thitherward,
being departed fr&omacr; Italic, by reason of the vprores that were there daily incresing,
he ended his life to the great losse of learning, before he was full fiftie
yeares old. He had sundrie works in hand, which he could not haue finished by
reason of his vntimelie death. How d&eacute;ere and entier friends he and I were one to
the other during his life, the letters he addressed me from time to time, to the
number of six hundred, thwackt with loue and kindnesse, doo manifestlie declare.
And by perusing of them after his death (such is the force of friendship) I am
greatlie comforted. Thus farre Camertes. This Mauricius wrote "Commentarios

Bononiensis vnderstanding that he being an Irishman, was so hot in the controuersie,
was egerly bent against Obuge, because he assured himselfe to haue

Giraldines his kinsmen were planted, and therevpon he was banished Italic. This
storme in processe of time being appeased, the outcast Carmelite was made the
generall gardian of all his fraternitie in Ireland: which countrie by his continuall
teaching and preaching was greatlie edified. Ouer this he was so politike a councellor,
that the nobilitie and estates in causes of weight, would haue recourse to
him as to an oracle. He was in philosophie an Aristotle, in eloquence a Tullie, in

adorning his d&eacute;epe knowledge therein with sinceritie of life. Being sent into
Ireland by the appointment of Colestinus the first, accompanied with Segetius a
priest, he conuerted the Iland from idolatrie and paganisme to christianitie. He

<p>BEFORE I attempt the vnfolding of the maners of the meere Irish, I thinke
it expedient, to forewarne th&eacute;e reader, not to impute anie barbarous custome that

shall be here laid downe, to the citizens, townesmen, and inhabitants of the English
pale, in that they differ litle or nothing from the ancient customes and dispositions
of their progenitors, the English and Welsh men, being therefore as mortallie
behated of the Irish, as those that are borne in England. For the Irish man
<note place="marg">Irish gentilitie.</note>
standeth so much vpon his gentilitie, that he termeth anie one of the English sept,
and planted in Ireland, Bobdeagh Galteagh, that is, English churle: but if he be an
Englishman borne, then he nameth him, Bobdeagh Saxonnegh, that is, a Saxon
churle: so that both are churles, and he the onelie gentleman. And therevpon if
the basest pezzant of them name himselfe with his superior, he will be sure to place
himselfe first, as I and Oneile, I and you, I and he, I and my master, whereas
the courtesie of the English language is cleane contrarie.</p>

<note place="marg">The inclination of the people.</note>
<p>The people are thus inclined, religious, franke, amorous, irefull, sufferable
infinit paines, verie glorious, manie sorcerers, excellent horssemen, delighted with
wars, great almesgiuers, passing in hospitalitie. The lewder sort, both clearkes and
laie men are sensuall and ouer loose in liuing. The same being vertuouslie bred vp
or reformed, are such mirrors of holinesse and austeritie, that other nations reteine
but a shadow of deuotion in comparison of them. As for abstinence and fasting,
it is to them a familiar kind of chastisement. They follow the dead corpse to the
graue with howling and barbarous outcries, pitifull in apparance: whereof grew,
as I suppose, the prouerbe, To w&eacute;epe Irish.</p>

<note place="marg">To w&eacute;epe Irish.</note>
<p>Gr&eacute;edie of praise they be, &amp; fearefull of dishonor, and to this end they est&eacute;eme
their poets, who write Irish learnedlie, and pen their sonets heroicall, for the which
<note place="marg">Poets est&eacute;emed.</note>
they are bountifullie rewarded; if not, they send out libels in dispraise, whereof
the lords and gentlemen stand in great awe. They loue tenderlie their foster children,
<note place="marg">Foster children.</note>
and bequeath to them a childes portion, whereby they nourish sure friendship:
so beneficiall euerie waie, that commonlie fiue hundred cowes and better, are giuen,
in reward to win a noble mans child to foster, they loue &amp; trust their foster brethren
more than their owne. The men are cleane of skin and hew, of stature tall.
<note place="marg">The stature of the people.</note>
The women are well fauoured, cleane coloured, faire handed, big &amp; large, suffered
from their infancie to grow at will, nothing curious of their feature and proportion
of bodie.</p>
<p>Their infants, they of meaner sort, are neither swadled nor lapped in linnen,
<note place="marg">Infants.</note>
but folded vp starke naked in a blanket till they can go. Proud they are of long
crisped bushes of heare which they terme glibs, and the same they nourish with all
<note place="marg">Glibs.</note>
their cunning, to crop the front thereof they take it for a notable p&eacute;ece of villanie.
Water cresses, which they tearme shamrocks, roots and other herbs they f&eacute;ed vpon,
<note place="marg">Their diet.</note>
otemeale and butter they cram togither, they drinke wheie, milke, and beefebroth.
Flesh they deuoure without bread, and that halfe raw: the rest boileth in
their stomachs with <emph>Aqua vit&oelig;,</emph> which they swill in after such a surfet by quarts and
pottels: they let their cowes bloud, which growne to a gellie, they bake and ouerspread
with butter, and so eate it in lumps. No meat they fansie so much as
porke, and the fatter the better. One of Iohn Onels houshold demanded of his fellow
<note place="marg">Porke.</note>
whether b&eacute;efe were better than porke? That (quoth the other) is as intricat a
question, as to aske whether thou art better than Onele.</p>
<p>Their noble men, and noble mens tenants, now and then make a set feast, which
they call coshering, wherto flocke all their reteiners, whom they name followers,
<note place="marg">Coshering.</note>

<note place="marg">Followers.</note>
their rithmours, their bards, their harpers that f&eacute;ed them with musike: and when
the harper twangeth or singeth a song, all the companie must be whist, or else he
chafeth like a cutpursse, by reason his harmonie is not had in better price. In
their coshering they sit on straw, they are serued on straw, and lie vpon mattresses
and pallets of straw. The antiquitie of this kind of feasting is set foorth by Virgil,
<note place="marg"><emph>Lib. pri. Aen circa finem.</emph></note>
where Dido interteineth the Troian prince and his companie. They obserue di

uerse degr&eacute;es, according to which each man is regarded The basest sort among
them are little yoong wags, called Daltins, these are lackies, and are seruiceable
<note place="marg">Daltin.</note>
to the groomes or horssebotes, who are a degr&eacute;e aboue the Daltins. Of the third
<note place="marg">Groome.</note>
degr&eacute;e is the kerne, who is an ordinarie souldior, vsing for weapon his sword and
<note place="marg">Kerne.</note>
target, and sometimes his peece, being commonlie so good markemen as they will
come within a score of a great castell. Kerne signifieth (as noble men of deepe
<note place="marg">Kigheiren.</note>
udgement informed me) a shower of hell, because they are taken for no better
than for rakehels, or the diuels blacke gard, by reason of the stinking sturre they
k&eacute;epe, wheresoeuer they be.</p>
<p>The fourth degr&eacute;e is a galloglasse, vsing a kind of pollar for his weapon. These
<note place="marg">Galloglasse.</note>
men are commonlie weieward rather by profession than by nature, grim of countenance,
tall of stature, big of lim, burlie of bodie, well and stronglie timbered.
chieflie f&eacute;eding on b&eacute;efe, porke &amp; butter. The fift degr&eacute;e is to be an horsseman,
which is the chiefest next the lord and capteine. These horssemen, when
<note place="marg">Horsseman.</note>
they haue no staie of their owne, gad &amp; range from house to house like arrant
knights of the round table, and they neuer dismount vntil they ride into the hall,
and as farre as the table. There is among them a brotherhood of karrowes, that
<note place="marg">Karrow.</note>
proffer to plaie at cards all the yeare long, and make it their onelie occupation.
They plaie awaie mantle and all to the bare skin, and then trusse themselues in
straw or leaues, they wait for passengers in the high waie, inuite them to game
vpon the gr&eacute;ene, and aske no more but companions to make them sport. For default
of other stuffe, they pawne their glibs, the nailes of their fingers and toes,
their dimissaries, which they l&eacute;ese or red&eacute;eme at the courtesie of the winner.</p>
<p>One office in the house of noble men is a taleteller, who bringeth his lord asl&eacute;epe
<note place="marg">A taleteller.</note>
with tales vaine and firiuolous, wherevnto the number giue sooth and credit. Without
either precepts or obseruations of congruitie, they speake Latine like a vulgar
<note place="marg">Latin spoken as a vulgar language</note>
language, learned in their common schooles of leachcraft and law, whereat they
begin children, and hold on sixt&eacute;ene or twentie yeares, conning by rote the aphorismes
of Hippocrates, and the ciuill institutes, with a few other parings of those
faculties. In their schooles they groouell vpon couches of straw, their bookes at
their noses, themselues lie flat prostrate, and so they chant out with a lowd voice
their lessons by p&eacute;ecemeale, repeating two or three words thirtie or fortie times togither.
Other lawyers they haue liable to certeine families, which after the custome
of the countrie determine and iudge causes. These consider of wrongs offered
and receiued among their neighbors: be it murther, felonie, or trespasse, all
is remedied by composition (except the grudge of parties s&eacute;eke reuenge) and the
time they haue to spare from spoiling and preiding, they lightlie bestow in parling
about such matters. The Breighon (so they call this kind of lawyers) sitteth on a
<note place="marg">Breighon.</note>
banke, the lords and gentlemen at variance round about him, and then they proc&eacute;ed.
To rob and spoile their enimies they d&eacute;eme it none offense, nor seeke anie
meanes to recouer their losse, but euen to watch them the like turne. But if
neighbors &amp; friends send their purueiors to purloine one another, such actions are
iudged by the Breighons aforesaid. They honour and reuerence friers and pilgrims,
<note place="marg">R&egrave;igious fauoured.</note>
by suffering them to passe quietlie, and by sparing their mansions, whatsoeuer outrage
they shew to the countrie besides them. The like fauor doo they extend to
their poets &amp; rithmours.</p>
<p>In old time they much abused the honorable state of mariage, either in contracts
<note place="marg">Matrimonie abused.</note>
vnlawfull, m&eacute;eting the degr&eacute;es of prohibition, or in diuorsements at pleasure, or
in reteining concubines or harlots for wiues: yea euen at this daie, where the clergie
is faint, they can be content to marrie for a yeare and a daie of probation: and
at the years end, or anie time after, to returne hir home with hir mariage goods,
or as much in valure, vpon light quareis, if the gentlewomans friends be vnabie

to renenge the iniurie. In like maner maie she forsake hir husband. In some
<note place="marg">Superstition in baptisme.</note>
corner of the land they vsed a damnable superstition, leauing the right armes of
their infants vnchristened as they tearme it) to the intent it might giue &amp; more
vngratious and deadlie blow. Others write that gentlemens children were baptised
<note place="marg"><emph>Iohn Cai. li.</emph> 2. <emph>Cant. ant.</emph></note>
in milke, and the infants of poore folke in water, who had the better or rather the
onelie choise. Diuerse other vaine and execrable superstitious hey obserue, that
for a complet recitall would require a seuerall volume. Whereto they are the more
<note place="marg">Ireland why superstitious.</note>
stiffelie wedded, bicause such single preachers as they haue, reprooue not in their
sermons the p&eacute;euishnesse and fondnesse of these friuolous dreamers. But these and
the like enormities haue taken so d&eacute;epe root in that people, as commonlie a preacher
is sooner by their naughtie liues corrupted, than their naughtie liues by his preaching
amended.</p>
<p>Againe, the verie English of birth, conuersant with the sauage sort of that people
become degenerat, and as though they had tasted of Circes poisoned cup, are quite
altered. Such force hath education to make or mar. God with the beams of his grace
clarifie the eies of that rude people, that at length they maie see their miserable estate:
and also that such as are deputed to the gouernement thereof, bend their industrie
with conscionable policie to reduce them from rudenes to knowledge, from rebellion
to obedience, from trecherie to honestie, from sauagenesse to ciuilitie, from idlenesse
to labour, from wickednesse to godlinesse, whereby they maie the sooner
espie their blindnesse, acknowledge their loosenes, amend their liues, frame themselues
pliable to the lawes and ordinances of hir maiestie, whome God with his gratious
assistance preserue, aswell to the prosperous gouernment of hir realme of
England, as to the happie reformation of hir realme of Ireland.</p>
