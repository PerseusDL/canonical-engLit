<p>AS from the time of <emph>Giraldus Cambrensis</emph> (the best deserued
and exact writer of the conquest and state of Ireland in his
time, few or none haue followed and continued any perfect
course of that historie vntill the death of king Henrie the
eight, and the beginning of king Edward the sixt 1546; and
therefore no certeine knowledge nor assurance can be yelded,
nor set downe either of the quiet gouernement in time of
peace, or of the troublesome state in time of warres and rebellions;
but that which is collected either out of the records,
which were verie slenderlie &amp; disorderlie kept, or out of some
priuat mens collections and pamphlets, remaining in some od
and obscure places: euen so the like from that time vnto these
presents hath happened and is fallen out, euerie gouernour
neglecting, and verie few others for want of due obseruations
willing, to commit vnto writing what was doone, and woorthie
the memoriall; sauing the things so latelie doone are not
altogither out of remembrance, and some yet liuing that can

remember some things doone in their times. And yet that
is so vncerteine, and euerie man so varieth one from the others
reports, that no man can well therevpon set downe a perfect
and so exact a course as the nature of an historie requireth,
and as it ought to be doone. He therefore that vpon such
vncerteinties shall intermedle and vndertake the penning,
much more the printing of such an vncerteine, confused, and
intricate discourse, must looke and be assured to be subiect
to manie cauils and reproches: which thing discouraged me
the writer hereof to intermedle at all in this historie. Neuerthelesse,
this worke requiring a supplie, and my selfe being
earnestlie required to doo something herein, haue aduentured
the matter, and by all the meanes I could, haue searched
and collected to set downe in this short discourse and rhapsodie,
what by writings or reports I could learne and find to
be true, and worthie the memoriall: which albeit, it be not
so full as the worke requireth, nor so sufficient as to the satisfaction
of the reader, nor yet so answerable to the nature of
an historie as is necessarie and requisit: yet let the good will
of the writer be his discharge from reproch, and be an occasion
to the learned to amend the thing thus in a good affection
begun, and to reduce it to a more full measure in matter
and truth: that this historie may haue his perfection, the
reader satisfied, and this writer acquited.</p>

<p>AFTER the death of king Henrie the eight, sir Anthonie Sentleger knight, was
<note place="marg">Sir Anthonie Sentleger reuoked.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1547</date></note>

<note place="marg">Sir Edward Bellingham made lord deputie.</note>
reuoked; who deliuered vp the sword at his departure vnto sir William Brabston
knight; and he was lord iustice, vntill such time as sir Edward Bellingham was sent
ouer to be deputie. This man was seruant to king Edward the sixt, and of his
priuie chamber: a man verie well learned, graue and wise, and therewith stout &amp;
valiant, and did verie worthilie direct his gouernment. In his time there was a mint
<note place="marg">A mint in Dublin.</note>
kept in the castell of Dublin, which being at his commandement, he was the better
able to doo good seruice to the king his maiestie, and to the benefit of that realme.
In the ciuill gouernment he was carefull to place learned and wise magistrats, vnto
<note place="marg">Sir Edward Bellinghams carefulnesse in gouernement.</note>
whome he had a speciall eie for the dooing of their offices; as he had the like care
for good and expert capteins, to serue in the martiall affaires. And for the more
sp&eacute;edie seruice to be doone therein at all times needfull, he kept sundrie stables of
<note place="marg">Sundrie stables of horsses kept.</note>
horsses: one at Leighlin, one at Lex, and some in one place and some in another,
as he thought most m&eacute;et for seruice. And whatsoeuer he had to doo, or what
seruice soeuer he meant to take in hand, he was so secret, and kept the same so
<note place="marg">His secrecie in his seruice.</note>
priuie, as none should haue anie vnderstanding thereof, before the verie instant of
the seruice to be doone; and for the most part, whensoeuer he tooke anie iournie in
hand, his owne men knew not whither, or to what place he would ride, or what he
would doo. It happened that vpon some occasion he sent for the earle of Desmond,
who refused to come vnto him. Wherevpon calling vnto him his companie as he
thought good, and without making them acquainted what he minded to doo, tooke
horsse &amp; rode to Leighlin bridge. The abbeie there (being suppressed) he caused
<note place="marg">Leighlin abbeie inclosed with a wall and made a fort.</note>
to be inclosed with a wall, and made there a fort. In that house he had a stable of
twentie or thirtie horsses, and there he furnished himselfe and all his men with
horsses and other furniture, and foorthwith rode into Mounster, vnto the house of the

earle, being then Christmas; and being vnlooked and vnthought of, he went in to
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond taken in his house.</note>
the earle, whome he found sitting by the fire, and there tooke him, and caried him
with him to Dublin.</p>
<p>This earle was verie rude both in gesture and in apparell, hauing for want of good
<note place="marg">The earle is rude without nurture.</note>

<note place="marg">The earle instructed in ciuilitie.</note>
nurture as much good maners as his Kerns and his followers could teach him.
The deputie hauing him at Dublin, did so instruct, schoole, and informe him, that
he made a new man of him, and reduced him to a conformitie in maners, apparell,
and behauiours apperteining to his estate and degree; as also to the knowledge of his
dutie and obedience to his souereigne &amp; prince; and made him to kn&eacute;ele vpon his
kn&eacute;es sometimes an houre togither, before he knew his dutie. This though it were
verie strange to the earle, who hauing not b&eacute;ene trained vp in anie ciuilitie, knew
not what apperteined to his dutie and caning: neither yet of what autheritie and
maiestie the king his souereigne was; yet when he had well digested and considered
of the matter, he thought himselfe most happie that euer he was acquainted with
the said deputie, and did for euer after so much honor him, as that continuallie all
his life time at euerie dinner and supper, he would praie for the good sir Edward
<note place="marg">The earle praieth for sir Edward Bellingham.</note>
Bellingham: and at all callings he was so obedient and dutifull, as none more in that
land.</p>
<p>This sir Edward lord deputie, when and where soeuer he trauelled, he would be
<note place="marg">The lord deputie would be chargeable to none.</note>
chargeable to no man; but would be at his owne charge. It happened that trauelling
the countrie, he was lodged on a night in vicount Baltinglasses house, where all
things were verie plentifullie prouided for him: which the vicount thought to haue
giuen and bestowed vpon his lordship: but at his departure, he commanded his
steward to paie &amp; discharge all things, thanking the vicount for his courtesie, but
refused his interteinement; saieng: "The king my maister hath placed me here to
serue him, and alloweth me therein for my charges and expenses: wherefore, I
neither maie nor will be burdenous nor chargable to anie other man." He was verie
exquisit &amp; carefull in the gouernement, as few before him the like; aswell in matters
martiall, as politike, magnanimous and couragious: in the one, to the appalling of
<note place="marg">The good gouernement of this deputie.</note>
the enimie; and as seuere &amp; vpright in the other, to the benefit of the commonwelth.
For neither by flatterie could he be gained, nor by briberie be corrupted; he was
feared for his seueritie, and beloued for his integritie; and no gouernor for the most
<note place="marg">Sir Edward Bellingham well beloued.</note>
vniuersallie better reported of than was he. But as vertue hath the contrarie to
enimie, so he found it true: for he was so enuied at, and that rebellious nation not
brooking so woorthie a man, who trauelled all the waies he could to reduce them to
the knowledge of themselues, and of their duties; and also to reforme that corrupt
state of gouernement, that great practises and deuises were made for his reuocation;
and matters of great importance informed and inforced against him. Wherevpon,
before two yeares ended of his gouernement, he was reuoked, and sir Francis Brian
<note place="marg"><date>1548</date></note>

<note place="marg">Sir Francis Brian lord iustice.</note>
made lord iustice. At his comming into England, great matters were laid vnto his
charge: but he so effectuallie did answer the same, that his maiesties doubtfulnesse
was resolued; &amp; he not onelie cl&eacute;ered, but also better liked than euer he was before,
&amp; should haue b&eacute;ne sent backe againe, had he not alleged his infirmitie; the which
was a fistula, and other good reasons, which were accepted for his excuse. Sir
<note place="marg">Sir Francis Brian maried the countes of Ormond, died and was buried at Waterford.</note>

<note place="marg">Sir William Brabston lord iustice.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1550</date></note>

<note place="marg">Sir Anthonie Sentleger lord deputie the second time.</note>
Francis Brian had maried the countesse of Ormond, and by that meanes he was a
dweller in that land: where he died &amp; was buried in the citie of Waterford. His
time of iusticeship was but short, &amp; no great matters could in so short a time
be doone by him. After his death, sir William Brabston had the sword deliuered
vnto him, and he continued lord iustice, vntill that sir Anthonie Sentleger came
ouer, who was now lord deputie the second time: who notwithstanding by his
knowledge &amp; experience he had good skill and did well gouerne: yet there remained

<note place="marg">Sir Iames Crofts lord deputie.</note>
than thought of, he was reuoked: and sir Iames Crofts was sent ouer to supplie
the place; his euill successes in good attempts did not answer his valour and good
deserts.</p>
<p>And albeit the time of his gouernement were not long, yet it continued vntill the
death of king Edward the sixt, and then he was called home, and sir Thomas
Cusacke and sir Gerard Elmer were appointed lords iustices, who iointlie gouerned

the estate, vntill qu&eacute;ene Marie sent ouer sir Anthonie Sentleger; who now the third
time was lord deputie. This man ruled and gouerned verie iustlie and vprightlie in
a good conscience, and being well acquainted in the courses of that land, knew how
to meete with the enimies, and how to staie all magistrates and others in their duties
and offices: for which though he deserued well, and ought to be beloued and commended:
yet the old practises were renewed, and manie slanderous informations
were made and inueighed against him: which is a fatall destinie, and ineuitable to
<note place="marg">A fatall destinie to euerie good gouernor to be slandered.</note>
euerie good gouernor in that land. For the more paines they take in tillage, the
worse is their haruest; and the better be their seruices, the greater is the malice and
enuie against them; being not vnlike to a fruitefull apple tr&eacute;e, which the more
apples he beareth, the more cudgels be hurled at him. Well, this man is called
<note place="marg"><date>1555</date></note>

<note place="marg">The lord Fitzwaters made lord deputie.</note>
home, and the lord Thomas Fitzwaters was made lord deputie. At sir Anthonies
comming ouer, great matters were laid to his charge, and manie heauie aduersaries
he had, which verie eagerlie pursued the same against him: wherein he so answered,
that he was not onelie acquited; but also gained his discharge for euer to passe
ouer anie more into so vnthankefull a land.</p>
<p>The lord Fitzwaters being lord deputie, after a short time of his being there, was
<note place="marg"><date>1555</date></note>

<note place="marg">Sir Henrie Sidneie and Corwen lords iustices.</note>
sent for into England. And in his absence, sir Henrie Sidneie then treasuror at
warres, and doctor Corwen, were for a time ioint lords iustices: but verie shortlie
after, a commission was sent to sir Henrie Sidneie to be sole lord iustice, and so
continued alone vntill the lord Fitzwaters, now earle of Sussex, came againe and
resumed his former office of deputie. After that he was come ouer, he had somewhat
to doo with the Oneile. For the whole north part of Ireland began to be
<note place="marg">The Oneile and all the north be vnquiet.</note>
vnquieted, and for preuenting of sundrie inconueniences, which might grow by the
Scotish Ilanders in aiding the said Oneile, the lord deputie made a iourneie and
voiage into the said Iles, to ioine them into his friendship. In his absence, he constituted
sir Henrie Sidneie lord iustice; but after that he had doone his businesse,
he returned againe to Dublin, where he remained and continued in his office vntill

the death of qu&eacute;ene Marie, and then he passed ouer into England, and left sir Henrie
Sidneie to be lord iustice now the fourth time. And after some time spent there,
and qu&eacute;ene Elisabeth now setled in the imperiall crowne of England, she sent ouer
the said earle as lieutenant of Ireland to performe those seruices, which before he
had taken in hand: who did verie great good seruice against the Irishrie, and by
meanes he tooke the Oneile, and kept him prisoner in the castell of Dublin: but yet
before he could or did bring the same to perfection, he was reuoked into England,
and left the land in a verie broken state; which was committed to sir Nicholas
Arnold, &amp; he was made lord iustice. But his gouernement being not well liked,
choise was made by hir maiestie and the councell of sir Henrie Sidneie, now knight
of the honorable order of the garter, to supplie that place, who then was lord president
of Wales.</p>
<p>This man had b&eacute;ene before a long seruitour to that realme, hauing for sundrie
yeares b&eacute;ene treasuror at warres, which is the second office vnder the lord deputie in
that land; as also had b&eacute;ene lord iustice solie and iointlie foure times. Great was
his knowledge, wisedome, and experience both of that land, and of the nature,

manners, and disposition of the people: wherein the more he excelled anie others
in those daies, the more apt and fit was he to haue the gouernement of them. He
was therefore called from out of Wales, where he then resided in his gouernement
<note place="marg">Sir Henrie Sidneie lord president of Wales.</note>
vnto the court: and there after conference had with hir highnesse, and with the
councell; he was appointed to be lord deputie of Ireland, being the seuenth yeare
of hir maiesties reigne, in the yeare of our Lord 1565. And then he receiued of
hir maiestie a booke of instructions signed with hir owne hand, dated the fift of
<note place="marg">A booke of articles deliuered to sir Henrie Sidneie for his gouernement.</note>
October 1565, the seuenth yeare of hir reigne aforesaid, concerning the principall
articles for his gouernement &amp; direction, which chieflie consisted in these points.</p>

<p>First, that there should be a bodie of a councell established, to assist him being
<note place="marg">A councell to be established.</note>
lord deputie, in the gouernement of the same realme in times of peace and of warre;
and whose names were then particularlie set downe: and order giuen, that euerie of
them should before their admission be sworne by the said lord deputie, according to
<note place="marg">Euerie councellor to be sworne.</note>
the accustomed manner: with an exhortation, that for somuch as hir maiestie had
reposed a speciall trust and confidence in their wisedomes, aduises, good counsels,
and seruices: he the lord deputie should vse their aduises, assistance, and counsels
in all matters of treatie and consultation, concerning the state of that realme.</p>
<p>And they likewise, considering the place and authoritie wherevnto hir maiestie
had called the said sir Henrie Sidneie, to hold hir place in that realme: they should
y&eacute;eld that obedience and reuerence vnto him, as to such a principall officer dooth
apperteine. And then they both togither, to haue a speciall care and regard to the
gouernement, which was comprised in foure articles that doo orderlie hereafter
follow.</p>

<p>
<list type="ordered">
<head>The said foure articles were these.</head>

<item n="1">FIRST, that they should faithfullie and earnestlie regard the due and reuerend
<note place="marg">Gods lawes to be kept, and christian religion to be vsed.</note>
obseruation of all Gods lawes and ordinances, made and established for the maintenance
of the true christian faith and religion among hir people; and that all
meanes should be vsed, aswell by doctrine and by teaching, as by good examples,
that deuotion and godlinesse might increase, and contempt of religion might be
restreined, punished, and suppressed. That learning in the scriptures might be
<note place="marg">Learning of the scriptures to be mainteined.</note>
mainteined and increased among the cleargie, and that for the reliefe of the ecclesiasticall
state, no alienations nor wasts of the lands perteining to anie church or college,
<note place="marg">The church lands not to be alienated.</note>
should be alienated: neither anie impropriations of benefices be put in vre:
besides sundrie other articles incident to this effect.</item>

<item n="2">The second was, that the administration of law and iustice should dulie and
<note place="marg">The lawes to be dulie administred.</note>
vprightlie be executed, without respect of persons: that inquirie be made what
notable faults are in anie of the iudges, or other ministers of the law: that vnfit
persons maie be remoued from their places, and some sufficient persons of English
birth be chosen to supplie the same. That shiriffes be appointed and renewed in
<note place="marg">Shiriffes to be appointed in euerie shire.</note>
euerie countie, and to execute their offices vprightlie, according to the lawes of
England.</item>

<item n="3">The third, that the garrisons and men of warre be well ordered to the benefit
<note place="marg">The garisons to be looked vnto.</note>
of the realme, and repressing of disordered subiects and rebels: that they doo line
according to the orders appointed, without oppression of the good and true
subiects. That there shall be once within a moneth at the least a muster made
<note place="marg">A muster to be kept euerie moneth.</note>
either by the lord deputie, or by such commissioners as he shall appoint m&eacute;ete and
indifferent for that purpose; who shall make inquirie of the number of the souldiors
vnder euerie capteine; for the sufficiencie of their persons, their horsses, armors,

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"and"</fw>-->


<pb n="327"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"327"</fw>-->


and weapons, and other their necessaries: and how they were paied of their wages,
and whether they were Englishmen or not.</item>

<item n="4"> The fourth article was, whether there had b&eacute;ene had a due care &amp; regard to the
<note place="marg">A due regard to be had of hir maiesties reuenues.</note>
preseruation of the reuenues of the crowne, &amp; for the recouerie of that which is
withdrawne. And whether euerie of the officers appointed for the receiuing of
anie part of the said reuenues, as namelie the receiuers of rents, shiriffes, exchetors,
<note place="marg">That euerie officer of receipts doo yearelie make his account.</note>
collectors of the subsidies, customors, clerks of the crowne, of the hamper, and of
the first fruits, and the farmers of customes and such others, did yearelie make and
answer their accounts; and besides sundrie other articles incident to euerie of these
principals.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>After that he had receiued this booke, and his commission, he prepared himselfe
<note place="marg">Sir Henrie Sidneie taketh his leaue of the qu&eacute;ene and councell.</note>
with all the expedition he could, to follow the great charge committed vnto him:
which being doone, he repaired to hir maiestie and tooke his leaue: and to his farewell,
she gaue him most comfortable sp&eacute;eches and good counsels, promising hir
fauor and countenance to all his well dooings, and a consideration for the same
when as time should serue. The like leaue he tooke also of the lords of the councell,
who in like order gaue him the like farewell: and these things doone, he
departed towards the sea side, where after he had taried a long time for a good wind
and passage, he tooke ship, and arriued in Ireland the thirt&eacute;enth of lanuarie, about
fiue miles from Dublin, and from thense he trauelled to Dublin; where he was most
<note place="marg">Sir Henrie Sidneie loifullie receiued into Dublin.</note>
honorablie receiued by sir Nicholas Arnold then lord iustice, and the whole councell;
togither with the maior and his brethren of that citie. And the people in great
troops came and saluted him, clapping and shooting with all the ioie that they could
deuise.</p>
<p>The next sundaie then next following, being the seuenth daie of his arriuall, and
the twentith of the moneth, he accompanied with the lord iustice and councell,
repaired to the high church in the citie named Christes church; where after that the
diuine seruice was doone, he tooke his oth, receiued the sword, and assumed vpon
him the gouernement: and wherwith he made a most pithie, wise, and eloquent
oration, which consisted vpon these speciall points. The first, what a pretious thing
<note place="marg">The benefit of good gouernement.</note>
is good gouernement, and how all realmes, commonwealths, cities, and countries
doo flourish and prosper, where the same is orderlie, in equitie, iustice, and wisedome,
directed &amp; gouerned. Secondlie, what a continuall care the queenes highnesse
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;enes maiesties continuall care for Ireland.</note>
hath had, and yet hath, not onelie for the good guiding &amp; ruling of the realme
of England, but also of Ireland; which she so earnestlie desireth, and wisheth to be
preserued, as well in peace as in warre: that she hath made great choise from time
to time of the most graue, wise, and expert councellors for the one; and the most
valiant, skilfull, and expert men of armes for the other: that both in peace and
warres, the publike state of the commonwealth, and euerie particular member
therein might be conserued, defended, and kept in safetie vnder hir gouernement.
And for the performance thereof, hir maiestie ouer and besides the reuenues of the
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;enes maiestie expendeth yearelie out of hir owne cofers for Ireland sundrie thousands of pounds.</note>
crowne of Ireland, did yearelie far aboue anie of hir progenitors, expend of hir
owne cofers out of England, great masses of monie, amounting to manie thousand
pounds. All which hir excessiue expenses and continuall cares she made the lesse
account of; so that hir realme and subiects of Ireland might bepreserued, defended,
and gouerned.</p>
<p>Lastlie, notwithstanding hir maiestie might haue made better choise of manie
others, who were better able to hold hir place in this realme, both for honor, wisedome,
and experience: yet hir pleasure was now to cast this heauie charge and
burden vpon him. Which he was the more vnwilling to take vpon him, because the
greater the charge was, the more vnable &amp; weake he was to susteine the same.

Neuerthelesse, being in good hope, and well promised of hir highnesse fauor and
countenance in his well dooings, and hauing his confidence in them hir highnesse
councellors associated vnto him, to ioine, aid, and assist him in this gouernement:
he was and is the more readie to take the sword in hand: in hope that this his gouernement
shall be to the glorie of God, the honor of hir maiestie, the benefit of the
commonwelth, and the preseruation of the whole realme and people of the same.
And so making his earnest request to the said lords present, for their conioining with
him, and the aiding and assisting of him in this hir maiesties seruice, he made an
end of his speeches.</p>
<p>The said councellors, hauing well considered the great value and weight of this his
graue and wise oration, did most humblie thanke his lordship for the same, and promised
in all dutifulnesse, faith, and obedience to performe and attend whatsoener to
them in anie wise should apperteine. These things doone, they all conducted the said
lord deputie in all honorable manner vnto the castell of Dublin: the common people
<note place="marg">The congratulation of the people.</note>
in euerie street and corner meeting him, and with great acclamations and ioie did
congratulat vnto his lordship his comming among them in that office. Immediatlie
after the performance of all the solemnities, perteining to these actions, he called
and assembled all those persons which hir highnesse had appointed, admitted, and
allowed to be of hir maiesties priuie councell for that realme, and did sweare them
according to the accustomed manner. Then from time to time they assembled and
met, consulting and deliberating what waie and order were best to be taken for reparing
of that broken commonweale and ruinous state, being as it were a man altogither
<note place="marg">The broken state of Ireland.</note>
infected with sores and biles, and in whose bodie from the crowne of the
head to the sole of the foot there is no health. And surelie if the state of that land
was euer miserable and in perill to be ouerthrowne: it was neuer more like than at
these presents; for as for the English pale, it was ouerwhelmed with infinite numbers
<note place="marg">The English pale wasted and spoiled.</note>
of caterpillers, who dailie by spoiles and robberies haue deuoured and wasted the
same: whereby the people vniuersallie were so poore, and the commons in such
extreame penurie, that they had not horsses, armor nor weapons to defend them, nor
apparell, vittels, nor anie other necessaries to rel&eacute;eue them; the soldiors so beggerlie
<note place="marg">soldiors oeggerlie and out of order.</note>
that they were most intolerable to the people, and so rooted in insolencie, loosenesse
and idlenesse, that vnlesse the remedie were the more speedie, they would b&eacute;e past
correction: and so much the worsse, bicause manie of them were alied in mariage,
and companies of the Irish: who the more they were affected to them, their truth
and seruice more doubtfull to hir maiestie. The prouince of Leinster and they altogither
<note place="marg">The miserable state of Leinster.</note>
most miserable, the Tools, Obrines, Kinsbelaghes, Odoiles, Omoroughs,

to spoiles and all mischiefs, no place of anie safetie remaining for the good subiect:
especiallie in the countie of Kilkennie, which being sometimes a fertile rich soile, and
<note place="marg">The fertile soile of the countie of Kilkennie made wast.</note>
well manured and inhabited, became of all others most desart and beggerlie, verie
few being left to inhabit the same.</p>
<p>Mounster, the inhabitants there likewise for the most part being followers to the

earle of Desmond, and following his wars against the erle of Ormond, made that
prouince, and especiallie the counties of Tipporarie and Kirrie, being wealthie and
rich, to become bare and beggerlie; and verie few of whom hir maiestie was or
could be assured. Notwithstanding experience had taught them, and they assured,
that no waie was for their recouerie and safetie so good and assured, as to humble
themselues, and to become hir highnesse loiall and obedient subiects: yet as swine
delighting in their dirt and puddles, contented themselues rather with a beggerlie
life to be miserable, than in dutifull obedience to be at peace and assured. The

betw&eacute;ene the erle of Clanrichard and Mac William Enter: the Irish countries all

conferences with the rebelles, and partlie by the particular discords among themselues.
Finallie, all the gentlemen throughout, woont in times past to be k&eacute;epers
<note place="marg">The gentlemen all impouerished.</note>
of hospitalitie, were by the dailie preies made vpon them and their tenants so impouerished
&amp; distressed, that they were not able to mainteine and rel&eacute;eue themselues
nor their families. The prouince of Vlster for wealth and plentie was well stored,
<note place="marg">Vister wealthie and rich.</note>
not onlie of themselues, but by reason that it was the receptacle and place of receipt
of all the preies and spoiles from out of the other prouinces: but as for loialtie,
dutifulnesse, and obedience to hir maiestie, they were most disloiall, rebellious, and
disordered. For after that Shane Oneile by blood and murther had gotten the maisterie,
<note place="marg">Shane Oneile.</note>
he alone then ruled the rost, who in pride exceeded all the men vpon the
earth, abiding no superior, nor allowing anie equall. And h&eacute;ere it were not amisse,
<note place="marg">The cause of Shane Oneiles rebellion.</note>
but verie expedient to set downe the first origin and cause whie the said Shane did
first breake out from his due obedience, and did shake off the gouernement of hir
maiestie, which (as farre as the writer hereof hath gathered and collected) is as here
followeth.</p>
<p>Con Oneile, the first earle of Tiron, had two sonnes, Matthew and this Shane or
Iohn. And king Henrie the eight hauing good liking of this Con Oneile, and to
reteine and keepe him a good subiect, he being a mightie man, and of great power
in his countrie, he made and created him earle of Tiron, and his eldest son Matthew
<note place="marg">Con Oneile made earle of Tiron.</note>
he made baron of Dunganon, and the remainder of the said earledome to the said
Matthew, and to the heirs male of his bodie. This Shane being the second brother,
and of an aspiring mind, enuied his elder brother, and in no wise could he brooke
him, but from time to time s&eacute;eketh occasions to quarell and fall out with him, and in
the end most traitorouslie and vnnaturallie murthered him: their father yet liuing,
who did not so much lament and bewaile the same, but began much more to distrust
of his owne safetie. Neuerthelesse, it is not knowen that the said Shane did offer
him anie violence, but when he was dead, although he had no right to succ&eacute;ed into
the earledome, by reason that Matthew his elder brother had left sons behind him,
who by the letters patents and course of the common law were to succeed the grandfather:
yet Shane vsurped the name of Oneile, and entred into his fathers inheritance
<note place="marg">Shane vsurpeth the name of Oneile.</note>

<note place="marg">The Irish custome in succession.</note>
according to the Irish manner, among whome the custome is, that the eldest in
years of the name of anie house or familie dooth succ&eacute;ed his ancestor, vnlesse at
the time of his death he had a son of the full age of one and twentie y&eacute;ers. And thus
hauing perforce entred into his fathers inheritance, he scorneth at the English
gouernement, and after the Irish manner proclaimeth himselfe Oneile, and the capteine
of his countrie, refuseth likewise all obedience to hir maiestie, and breaketh out
<note place="marg">Shane Oneile breaketh into rebellion.</note>
into open rebellion.</p>
<p>Sir Henrie Sidneie then lord iustice, in the absence of the erle of Sussex, being
aduertised of these stirs, taketh aduise of the councell what was best to be doone.
And then it was agreed, that the said lord iustice should take his iorneie towards
Dundalke, for the fortifieng of the English pale, and should send a messenger to
Shane Oneile, who then laie at a lordship of his about six miles from Dundalke, and
to will him come to Dundalke to his lordship: which was doone. But Shane
returned his answer, praieng pardon, and also most humblie requested his lordship

that it would please him to christen a son of his, &amp; be his gossip, &amp; then he would
<note place="marg">Shane Oneile praieth sir Henrie Sidneie tobe his gossip.</note>
come to his lordship to doo all things in seruice for hir maiestie, as his lordship should
command and appoint. This answere at the first was not thought good, nor yet
honorable to the lord iustice so to doo, vntill the said Shane had first come and submitted
himself. But when it was considered what great inconueniences might insue,
if his request were denied; it was agr&eacute;ed that the said lord iustice should condescend
vnto his request. And accordinglie vpon the last of Ianuarie, one thousand fiue
<note place="marg"><date>1558</date></note>
hundred fiftie and eight, he went vnto the said Shanes house, and there his lordship and
Iaques Wingfield were godfathers, and hauing performed the baptising of the child,
they both had conference of the matter: where the said Shane, to excuse his dooings,
<note place="marg">Shane excuseth himselfe whie h&eacute;e came not to the lord iustice.</note>
did allege for his defense sundrie articles as foloweth.</p>
<p>First, he said that Matthew baron of Dungannon was the sonne of one Kellaie of
Dundalke, a smith by occupation, begotten and borne during the spousals of the
<note place="marg">Matthew was Kellaies sonne.</note>
said Kellaie, and one Alson his wife, and that the said Matthew was alwaies taken and
reputed to be the sonne of the said Kellaie, vntill he was of the age of sixt&eacute;ene
<note place="marg">The obiections of Shane Oneil against the title of Matthew to be Oneile.</note>
yeares or thereabouts: at which time Con Oneile his father, vpon the saieng of the
said Alson, that he was the father of the said Matthew, did accept and take the said
Matthew to be his sonne, &amp; gaue him the name of Fardarough. And here vnderstand
you the wickednesse of this countrie; which is, that if anie woman doo mislike
<note place="marg">The wicked custome of the Irishrie.</note>
hir husband, and will depart from him, he shall haue all such children as were borne
of hir bodie during their abode togither, except such as she shall name to be begotten
by anie other man: which man so named shall by their custome haue the
said child: and so it should s&eacute;eme to be meant of this point. Also the said Matthew
<note place="marg">Matthew seeketh the seigniorie of Oneile.</note>
did vpon this the affirmation of his mother s&eacute;eke to vsurpe the name of a segniorie of
the Oneiles, and the dominions apperteining to that segniorie and surname. Also that
there be aboue a hundred of that name, which will not in anie wise y&eacute;eld to this the
clame of Matthew, although he for his owne part would be contented therewith. Also
he saith that the letters patents (if anie such be) that should intitle the sonne of the
said baron to the said lands are vtterlie void, because that Con Oneile father to the
said Shane had no other right nor interest to that countrie, but during his owne life:
and therefore without the consent of the lords and inhabitants of that countrie, could
make no surrender nor conueiance, wherby he might be inabled to take and haue
the said lands by force of letters patents.</p>
<p>Also he saith, that by the lawes in the English pale of Ireland, no letters patents,
made to anie person, be of anie force or value, vntill that an inquisition be taken of the
lands so giuen before that the letters patents doo passe: which in this case neither was,
nor could be doone, sith the countrie of Tiron is no shire ground. Also if the said
lands should according to the qu&eacute;ens lawes descend to the right heire, then in right
it ought to descend to him, as next heire being mulierlie borne; and the other not so
borne. Also he saith, that vpon the death of his father lord of the countrie, the
whole countrie according to the custome of the countrie did assemble themselues
togither, and by a common consent did elect and choose (without anie contradiction)
him the said Shane to be Oneile, as the most worthie and ablest of that countrie. Which
election by the custome of the countrie hath beene alwaies vsed without anie confirmation,
asked of the kings and qu&eacute;enes of England. Also he saith that as Oneile
he clameth such authorities, iurisdictions, and duties vpon his men &amp; countrie, as are due
time out of mind to his predecessors, and which duties for the most part are recorded,
and remaine in writing. When the lord iustice had at full heard these articles, and
considered well of them togither with the councell, made answer vnto Shane that the
matter was of great weight and importance, &amp; which neither he nor the councell cold
determine of themselues, before hir maiestie were made priuie and acquainted there

with; and therefore in the meane time willed and required him to be quiet, and to
shew himselfe a dutifull subiect vnto hir maiestie, nothing doubting but that he should
haue and receiue at hir hands, what should be found m&eacute;et, right, and iust.</p>
<p>And so hauing vsed manie good and freendlie sp&eacute;eches and exhortations vnto him,
<note place="marg">Shane Oneile promiseth to be quiet.</note>
the said Shane promised to vse and behaue himselfe well and honestlie, &amp; as to his
dutie should apperteine: they departed in verie freendlie manner. And thus in such
wisedome and politike manner the lord iustice handled the matter, that by temporising
and gaining of time all matters were pacitied, and so continued vntill the comming
ouer of the earle of Sussex lord deputie: who then of a new tooke the matter in
hand, and he did so streictlie and seuerelie follow the same, that he ouermatched
Sliane Oneile. But it so greeued the said Shane, that notwithstading and ing he dissembled
and gaue a good countenance, &amp; promised well, yet in the end being once at libertie,
he performed nothing: but as the woolfe which often casteth his haires but neuer
changeth his conditions, was one and the same man or rather worse, and thenseforth
<note place="marg">Shane Oneile is become a tyrant and a rebell.</note>
tyrannized and vsed most crueltie, and of all others most disloiall and disobedient;
to the deputie would he not come, nor would he in anie wise confer with him, but at
his owne pleasure.</p>
<p>The qu&eacute;enes maiestie in some termes he would honor, but in d&eacute;eds he denied all
obedience, subtill and craftie he was especiallie in the morning: but in the residue
of the daie verie vncerteine and vnstable, and much giuen to excessiue gulping
and surfetting. And albeit he had most commonlie two hundred tunnes of wines in
<note place="marg">Shane Oneil a drunkard and a surfetter.</note>
his cellar at Dundrun, and had his full fill therof, yet was he neuer satisfied, till he
had swallowed vp maruellous great quantities of Vskebagh or Aqua vite of that
countrie: wherof so vnmeasurablie he would drinke and bouse, that for the quenching
of the heat of the bodie, which by that meanes was most extremelie inflamed and
distempered, he was eftsoones conueied (as the common report was) into a d&eacute;epe
<note place="marg">Shane Oneil buried in the ground after his drunkennesse.</note>
pit, and standing vpright in the same, the earth was cast round about him vp to
the hard chin, and there he did remaine vntill such time as his bodie was recouered
to some temperature : by which meanes though he came after in some better plight
for the time, yet his manners and conditions dailie worse. And in the end his
pride ioined with wealth, drunkennesse, and insolencie, he began to be a tyrant, and
to tyrannize ouer the whole countrie; greatlie it was feared that his intent was to
haue made a conquest over the whole land. He pretended to be king of Vlster, euen
as he said his aucestors were, and affecting the maner of the great Turke, was continnallie
<note place="marg">Shane Oneils force.</note>
garded with six hundred armed men, as it were his Ianisaries about him,
and had in readinesse to bring into the fields a thousand horssemen, and foure thousand
footmen. Ile furnished all the pesants and husbandmen of his countrie with
<note place="marg">The pesants in Vlster trained vp in warre.</note>
armour and weapons, and trained them vp in the knowledge of the wars: and as a lion
hath in awe the beasts of the field, so had he all the people to his becke and commandement,
being feared and not beloued.</p>
<p>Diuerse meanes and waies were practised and vsed by the lord deputie and councell
for the pacifieug and recoueric of him, and commissioners from time to time
sent vnto him; for and about the same, who sometimes would be verie flexible, but
foorthwith as backwards and vntoward. Of all the residue of Ireland there was the lesse
doubt to recouer them, by reason that they by their owne ciuill wars had consumed and
spoiled the one and the other: but of this man, small or no hope at all, vnlesse he might
be chastised, and with force be reduced to conformities. Which in the end it pleased
the Lord God to take the matter in hand, and to performe the same by taking of him
awaie. And bicause in these trouble sometimes, it were m&eacute;et aduertisements should go to
and from hir maiestie and councell to the lord deputie, &amp; so likewise from his lordship

should be set posts appointed betw&eacute;ene London and Ireland. This was then the present
<note place="marg">The miserable state of Ireland.</note>
state of all Ireland, altogethers deuoured with robberies, murders, riots, treasons,
ciuill and intestine warres, and few or none assured and faithfull to hir highnesse
out of the English pale, and out of cities and townes: and yet the one being gentlemen
and liuing by their lands, by continuall spoiles and robberies were decaied;
the other by the losse of their traffike being merchants impouerished, and brought
to such extremities, as not able to relieue and mainteine themselues.</p>
<p>And among all other the most intollerable miseries vniuersallie reigning, this one
<note place="marg">No God nor religion in Ireland.</note>
exc&eacute;eded all the rest, that there was scarse a God knowen; and if knowen, not all
honored in the land, for the churches for the most part were all destroied &amp; vncouered,
the clergie scattered, the people vntaught, and as sh&eacute;epe without their pastour wandering
without knowledge and instruction. Then where neither God is knowen, the
prince obeied, no lawes currant, no gouernement accepted, and all things infolded
in most extreme miserie; how lamentable and dolefull is that state and kingdome?
Wherfore sir Henrie Sidneie now lord deputie, &amp; the councell pondering this
distressed state, and the great burden which laie them vpon to helpe and redresse the
same, dailie assembled themselues; &amp; deuised the best waie what might be to be taken
herein. Wherin his lordships cause so much was the weaker, as that such as were
chiefest of the councell, then ioined to assist him in councell and seruice, were for
the most part spent and decaied men; and the lord deputie himselfe driuen to deuise,
to inuent, to dispose, and in the end to execute all himselfe. Well, neuerthelesse it
was concluded and agr&eacute;ed, that the English pale should be fortified and defended
from the inuasion of the Oneile and all his complices; and that the deuises
set downe for the staic and recouerie of the rest of the land should be followed from
time to time, as matter, time, and oportunitie would serue therevnto.</p>
<p>At this present time the earles of Ormond and Desmond were in England, and the
quarrels and controuersies growen betweene them were dailie examined before the
lords of the councell, and their allegations produced in writing by the one against
the other. And bicause their assertions were so contrarious and vncerteine in denieng
and affirming, as no proc&eacute;eding could be had for a finall end and order, it was
thought good and necessarie that their complaints and answers should be examined in
the realme of Ireland, where their dooings were best knowen, and where their misorders
were committed. And then by the aduise of the councell both the said earles
submitted themselues to the qu&eacute;enes maiesties order &amp; determination: and for performance
<note place="marg">The earles of Ormond and Desmond submit themselues to the queens order.</note>
thereof, they both by waie of recognisance in the chancerie were bound ech
of them in twentie thousand pounds. And then a commission vnder hir highnesse
broad seale of England was sent to the lord deputie for taking of the forsaid examinations.
But in the meane time whilest these things were in dooing in England,
sir Iohn of Desmond in verie outragious and disordered manner, fired &amp; spoiled
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn of Desmond spoileth the earle of Ormonds lands.</note>
the tenements of the earle of Ormond, which things were verie shortlie after appeased.
In these troublesome daies Mac Artimore an ancient gentleman of the
Irish race, the principall man of his sept in Mounster, hauing verie great possessions,
and laie still in peace and did nothing at all, neither tooke he partie with one
whom he liked not, neither holpe he the other whom he feared not, but to the outward
app&eacute;erance misliked both their dooings.</p>
<p>This man made his humble sute to hir maiestie, that he might surrender all his

lands, possessions and territories vnto hir maiesties highnesse, and to recognise his
dutie and allegiance to hir, and so to resume and haue a new estate therof from hir
againe, according to the orders and laws of England. Which hir maiestie did accept,
and foorthwith made him a new estate of inheritance: and for the better his staie in
all obedience and dutie to hir crowne, did for the worthinesse of his bloud &amp; stocke,

&amp; for the greatnesse of his gouernement make him a baron of the parlement in
that relme; &amp; for his further aduancement created him an earle vnder hir
<note place="marg">Mac Artimore made earle of Clancare.</note>
letters patents by the name of the earle of Clancare. These newes being reported
to Shane Oneile, he scoffed at it, nothing liking the choise of hir highnesse
<note place="marg">Shane Oneile scoffeth at the earle of Clancare.</note>
in aduansing such a one to that honour, and enuied and maligned him that
he was so honored. And therefore not long after, when the commissioners were
sent to intreat with him vpon sundrie points, they found him most arrogant &amp; out of
all good order, braieng out sp&eacute;eches not m&eacute;et nor s&eacute;emelie. "For (saith he)
you haue made a wise earle of Mac Artimore, I k&eacute;epe as good a man as is he.
And albeit I confesse the qu&eacute;ene is my souereigne ladie, yet I neuer made peace
with hir, but at hir s&eacute;eking." And where he had required to haue his parlement
<note place="marg">The proud taunts of Shane Oneile.</note>
robes sent vnto him as earle of Tiron, which title he claimed and required (which if it
were denied him, then he required a triall to be made in parlement) yet now he
cared not for so meane an honour as to be an earle, except he might be better and
higher than an erle. "For I am (saith he) in bloud and power better than the
best, and I will giue place to none of them; for mine ancestors were kings of Vlster.
And as Vlster was theirs, so now Vlster is mine and shall be mine: with the sword
I wan it, and with the sword I will k&eacute;epe it." Which his words fell out true,
<note place="marg">Shane Oneile for his pride and tyrannie becometh hatefull before God &amp; man.</note>
though long he inioied not the same: and foorthwith he fell into most horrible
tyrannies and cruelties, wherby he became execrable and hatefull vnto all his people
and countrie who were wearie of him.</p>
<p>Now hir maiestie, being gr&eacute;eued and annoied with his treasons and rebellions of
long time, was fullie minded either to haue him clearelie rooted out, or chastised:
but therein she was staied, being borne in hand that the best waie to bring him
to reformation, was to y&eacute;eld to him in sundrie things of him desired. But now
she seeing him to haue manifested himselfe a notorious traitor, and past all grace;
she gaue commandement to the lord deputie to imploie his whole care, consideration:
and wisedome, how such a cankred and dangerous rebell might be vtterlie extirped.
And s&eacute;eing the matter also to haue so manie accidents and circumstances belonging
vnto it, as which by letters to and fro could not b&eacute;e well concluded: therefore
she sent ouer sir Francis Knolles vicechamberleine, to conferre with the lord

matters of warre, as the whole state and gouernment of this realme. Who when he
was arriued, and hauing at large conferred with him about the same, the time betw&eacute;ene
them was concluded and appointed, that the seruice should be in the winter;
&amp; accordinglie things necessarie, as well monie, men, munitions, and vittels were
sent ouer, and Edward Randolph colonell of the footmen, and sundrie other capteius
arriued with their souldiers from out of England, and all things were disposed both
for the garrison and the campe, as it was conuenient to be.</p>
<p>Likewise the archtraitor knowing what preparation was made against him, he
dooth the like also on his part against hir maiestie; and at a lordship or manour
of his, about six miles out of Dundalke, he mustreth all his whole armie, which
was of foure thousand footmen, and seuen hundred horssemen. And glorieng
much in himselfe of such his great force and puissance, which he thought to suffice
to haue conquered all Ireland withall, and that no man durst to aduenture
vpon him: he marcheth vnto the towne of Dundalke, where he incampeth himselfe,
<note place="marg">Shane Oneile besiegeth Dundalke, &amp; is repelled.</note>
&amp; beseegeth the same. He was no more busie to giue sundrie attempts of inuasion,
and to enter the towne, but the souldiers within were as valiant to resist and
defend: which in the end turned to his reproch, and h&eacute;e had the repulse, being with
shame driuen to raise his siege, and to depart with the losse.</p>

yeare of the deputation of sir Heurie Sidneie, Edward Randolph, a verie expert and
<note place="marg">Coronell Randolph arriueth at the Dirrie where he intrencheth himselfe.</note>
a valiant soldier, was sent ouer out of England, and arriued at the Dirrie with seuen
hundred men vnder his regiment, and he himselfe by the councell in England appointed
to be the coronell. This man as soone as he was landed, intrenched himselfe
at the Dirrie, where he remained in garrison without dooing of anie thing, vntill
the comming of the lord deputie from Dublin, with the residue of hir maiesties forces,
appointed to be ioined with the said coronell, for the better seruice against the arrogant
traitour Shane Oneile.</p>
<p>And after that the said lord deputie was come, and had staid there about six daies,
<note place="marg">The lord deputie c&omacr;meth to the Dirrie and setteth all things in order for the seruice.</note>
and had set all things in such good order as that seruice required; he returned backe to
Dublin through Odonels countrie, and so thorough Connagh, leauing the coronell
accompanied with one band of fiftie horssemen vnder the leading of capteine George
Ileruie the elder, and with seuen companies or hundreds of footmen vnder the
charges of capteine Robert Cornewall, and capteine Iohn Ward, and others; all well
furnished, both with munitions, vittels, and all other necessaries meet and requisit.
Shane Oneile who knew well of the garrisons, of their forces &amp; numbers, and
<note place="marg">Oneil incampeth n&eacute;ere the Dirrie and offereth skirmish.</note>
he not minding that they should there rest in peace, but standing now vpon his honor
and reputation, incamped himselfe about two miles from the garrison, hauing
then in his armie two thousand fiue hundred footmen, &amp; thr&eacute;e hundred horsmen.
And fr&omacr; daie to daie he would continuallie with his horssemen houer and range the
fields, and shew himselfe readie to trie the matter if the Englishmen durst to aduenture
the same.</p>
<p>The coronell not liking these dailie offers, and thinking it to be a verie great dishonour
vnto him, and all the English nation, which were come ouer to serue against
him, and now would doo nothing, but were dailie bearded by the enimie: notwithstanding
that his forces when they were at the best, were but small in respect of
the enimie; and by reason of the sicknesse in the campe, that his small companie
was much weakened and vnable to serue: yet he was determined with a full resolution
to take the offer of the enimie, and either he would lose his life, or remooue
him from his so neere a seat. Wherevpon he drew out of his companie to the number
of three hundred men, whome he thought most m&eacute;et to serue, and being accompanied
<note place="marg">The coronell prepareth to fight with Oneile.</note>
with fiftie horssemen vnder capteine George Ileruie, marched toward Oueils
campe, who pretending a great ioy to s&eacute;e the forwardnesse of the Englishmen, he
with all his forces issued out, and with sp&eacute;ed prepared to incounter with them;
persuading himselfe that he should that daie be maister of the field, and haue a conquest
to his hearts desire.</p>
<p>The coronell made choise of the ground to fight in, and prepared himselfe to stand
and abide their charge. Oneile in great furie, and with a great multitude charged
the coronels footmen, and his maine battell; but he was so receiued with the English
shot and so galled, that he made some staie. Wherevpon capteine Hernie taking his
<note place="marg">The valiant seruice of capteine George Heruie.</note>
oportunitie, most valiantlie with his small band of horssemen brake in to the battell
of Oneile. Likewise coronell Randolph with his few horssemen gaue the charge vpon
the left wing of them. The one of them being well followed and accompanied with his
band, did the seruice which he desired: but the coronell verie valiantlie making
<note place="marg">The coronell Randolph is slaine.</note>
waie through the enimies, and no man following him, was in fighting wounded to
death, and whereof immediatlie he died. The rebels being astonied and amazed
at the valour of the Englishmen, fled and turned their backs, whome the souldiers
<note place="marg">Oneile and his companie flie, and are pursued, killed &amp; hurt about 800.</note>
followed, and had the slaughter of them so long as their weapons lasted in this con

flict. The rebels were slaine that daie in this chase aboue foure hundred persons, besides
the like number of such as were hurt and wounded. The coronell onelie was
slaine, but capteine Heruie and diuerse of the horssemen were verie sore hurt and
wounded.</p>
<p>After the death of this valiant coronell, whose funerall the lord deputie did afterwards
<note place="marg">The lord deputie k&eacute;epeth the coronell Randolphs funerals.</note>
celebrate with great honour at Dublin, Edward Sentlow was made coronell:
vnder whose gouernement the garrison liued verie quietlie. For this last ouerthrow
so quailed the spirits and courages of Oneile and his companie, that they had
no desire of anie further incountering with the Englishmen. And thus all the
winter following little was doone: and being determined in the spring to aduenture
some peece of seruice, but the lord otherwise appointed it. For about the foure and
twentith of Aprill, by a misfortune neuer yet knowne by what means, the fort and
<note place="marg">The Dirrie and all the vittels and munitions are burned.</note>
towne of the Dirrie was all burned, and the storehouses where the munitions and
vittels laie were blowne vp with the gunpowder, and twentie men killed with the
same: and so manie of the souldiers as laie sicke there were burned in their beds.
Wherevpon the coronell calling all his capteins togither, and considering the distresse
which they now were in, by the losse of their vittels and munitions, and not knowing
where to be furnished otherwise, they all concluded and determined to abandon that
<note place="marg">The coronell abandoneth Dirrie, and returneth to Dublin by seas.</note>

<note place="marg">Capteine George Heruie returneth by land in great danger.</note>
place, and to imbarke themselues for Dublin, which immediatlie they all did, sauing
capteine George Heruie: for he rather did choose to hazard his life to returne by land,
than to impouerish his souldiers by killing their horsses (which perforce they must
needs haue doone) for want of shipping. And therefore euen almost against all hope
he returned towards Dublin through the enimies countrie, who followed and chased
him foure daies togither without intermission, both with horssemen and footmen:
but at length he recouered Dublin, not without great woonder and admiration. The
lord deputie he wanted not his espials, both about Oneile, and in all places throughout
Vlster: and thereby knew the forces, bent, and determinations of euerie of them,
whereby he knew how to meet with them euerie waie for the best seruice of hir maiestie.
And yet considering the great importance of the seruice, he could not be satisfied
herein, but that he would make a iournie into Vlster himselfe. And being accompanied
<note place="marg">The lord deputie maketh a iournie into Vlster.</note>
with the earle of Kildare, and certeine of the councell, and with such cap,
teins and souldiers as he thought good: he aduanced &amp; set foorth out of Drogheda the
seuenteenth of September 1566, and incamped that night at Rosse Keagh, &amp; so from
<note place="marg"><date>1566</date></note>
thense he trauelled throughout Vlster, and passed thense vnto Athlon in Connagh,
where he came the six and twentith of October.</p>
<p>In this iournie the rebell neuer durst (for all his brags) once to shew his
<note place="marg">The pusillanimitie of the Oneile.</note>
face, nor to offer anie fight at all: sauing once at and n&eacute;ere a wood not far from
Glogher, where he offered a skirmish, and gaue the charge with horssemen, footmen,
and certeine Scotish shot: which continued a good space, and sundrie hurt on both
sides, but none died of his lordships men. He shewed himselfe also once with a great
multitude of horssemen and footmen, not farre from the castell of Tirlough Lenough,
called the Salmon, but tooke his ease and durst not to giue the aduenture. In this
iournie the lord deputie restored Odonell to the possession of his lands and castels,
<note place="marg">Odonell restored vnto his possessions.</note>

<note place="marg">The lord deputie recouereth a great countrie in Vlster vnto the crowne.</note>
kept by Oneile from him; &amp; sundrie lords and men of the best sort submitted themselues.
By which this his lordships iournie he recouered to hir highnesse a countrie
of foure score miles in length, and eight and fortie miles in bredth, without losse of
anie man sauing Mac Gwier, who being sicke died in this iournie; and sauing a few
persons which by the waie vpon an occasion would aduenture the winning of a certeine
Iland in the middle of a lough, wherein was supposed to be great store of wealth
and vittels of the enimies, and in assailing of it they were drowned.</p>

all the frontiers of the English pale with garrisons sufficient for the same. And as
concerning the troublesome state of Mounster, the earle of Desmond was in the field
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond is in campe and doth no hurt.</note>
with two thousand men, and incamped himselfe in places indifferent to annoie at his
pleasure the earle of Ormond, the lord Barrie, the lord Roch, and sir Moris Fitzgirald
of the Decies; but he did not hurt anie man at all: sauing one Mac Donogh a rebell
and a disloiall sauage man. The lord deputie being ouerlaied with the continuall cares
to resist Oneile, could not in person trauell into Mounster, nor yet without great
perill diuide his armie: wherefore he sent capteine Herne constable of Leighlin vnto
the said earle, whereby he might be aduertised of his intendement and meaning:
which appeared to be but a m&eacute;ere insolencie and an outrage to be reuenged vpon
the earle of Ormond, although the rumor was, that he would conioine with Oneile.
Which report when it came to his eares, and being aduertised that the lord deputie
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond maketh his repaire to the lord deputie.</note>
was offended with him that he had gathered such a force, and was in the fields. He
for his purgation herein, without further delaie, tooke his horsse, and hauing in
his companie onelie the baron of Dunboine, and capteine Herne, with their companies,
made hast to present himselfe before the lord deputie: where and before whome
for purging of himselfe, and to declare his dutie, he offered himselfe to his lordships
denotion, either to go and attend him vnto Vlster in that sort as he then was, or else
to follow him with all such force as he could get; the lord deputie finding him vittels:
and then to abide &amp; serue in Vlster in despite of Shane Oneile; or else that he
would in his lordships absence remaine vpon the borders there, with such a number
of horssemen, as should be appointed vnto him; shewing also and pretending such
dutifulnesse to hir maiestie, as was m&eacute;et for a subiect to shew to his souereigne.
The deputie hauing some liking of his offers, and considering the fickle state of
these presents, accepteth his last offer, willing him to go backe againe, and
to prepare a crew of one hundred horssemen, at the least, and so to returne againe
within fouret&eacute;ene daies: which he did, and with him came sir Iohn Desmond, his
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond serueth in the English pale.</note>
vncle the baron of Dunboine, the lord Powre and others: who accompanied
with the baron of Deluin, sir Warham Sentleger, and capteine Herne, did
remaine vpon the borders, vntill his lordships returne from out of his iournie in
Vlster.</p>
<p>And as the realme at large was much infested with the cruell warres of Oneile
and the troubles in Mounster; so also there wanted no daily complaints of griefs vnto
the lord deputie of sundrie persons one against an other. For Oliuer Sutton, a
<note place="marg">Oliuer Sutton complaineth against the earle of Kildare.</note>
gentleman dwelling in the English pale, did exhibit a certeine booke in writing, conteining
an information of sundrie notorious disorders in that realme, hurtfull to the
good policie of the same, and contrarie to sundrie good lawes and acts of parlement,
whereof a great part did touch the earle of Kildare. The matter was referred by hir
maiesties order to the hearing of the lord deputie and councell. Likewise sir Edmund
<note place="marg">The ladie of Dunboine complaineth against the Butlers.</note>
Butler and Piers his brother were greeuouslie complained vpon by the ladie of
Dunboine, Mac Brian Arra, Oliuer Fitzgirald, sir William Occarell, and others; for
their dailie outrages, robberies, murthers, preies, and spoiles taken. For the hearing
and appeasing of such matters, and for the better ministration of iustice, the lord
deputie had b&eacute;ene a long sutor to hir maiestie and councell for a chancellor to be
sent ouer, who at length were resolued vpon doctor Weston, deane of the
arches, who arriued at Dublin in Iulie 1567, a notable and a singular man, by profession

same: and so much good in the end insued of his vpright, diligent, and dutifull seruice,
as that the whole realme found themselues most happie and blessed to haue

plaints, both eased the lord deputie of a great burthen, and did most good to the
countrie, and acquited himselfe against hir maiestie.</p>
<p>But to returne to the lord deputie, who immediatlie vpon the dismissing of the
armie at Athlon, he tooke order (as is aforesaid) for placing of his garrisons in such
conuenient places vpon the frontiers, as then apperteined and was most m&eacute;et &amp; conuenient.
The rebell on his part leaueth nothing vndoon, which might be for the furtherance
of his enterprises: and being in great iollitie of himselfe deuised manie
things; and to make some shew of his abilitie, entered into the English pale, with
<note place="marg">The Oneile entereth the English pale with sword and fire.</note>

<note place="marg">The Oneile besiegeth Dundalke the second time, and departed with great dishonor.</note>

<note place="marg">The Oneile forsaken of friends.</note>

<note place="marg">Mac Gwier forsaketh Oneile, and so doo the Scots.</note>
sword and fire wasted the countrie, slue manie of hir maiesties subiects, and in the
end besieged hir highnesse towne of Dundalke: where his pride and treason were
iustlie scourged, who came not with so much glorie to besiege it, as he did
returne with shame to leaue and loose it. The lord deputie not abiding the same
nor sleeping his matters, determined to make a new rode vpon him: and in the meane
time, he so handled the matter, that he had vnfethered him of his best friends, aids,
and helps. For besides the whole countrie, as is before said, gained from him the
last iournie, Mac Gwier, a mightie man in his countrie forsooke him, and submitted
himselfe to hir maiestie, offering all loiall obedience and faithfull seruice, and to
receiue his lands and countrie at hir highnesse hands.</p>
<p>Alexander Og and Mac Donell offer to serue hir maiestie, with all the Scots vnder
them against the rebell. Con Odonell late deliuered from the rebell, offereth sernice
against him. Tirlogh Lenough with the helps of his neighbours dailie backed
the said Oneile, that his force was quailed that waie. The lord deputie had continuallie
four regiments residing neere the English pale, who continuallie as
it were by turnes were occupied in persecuting of the rebell: &amp; his lordship being
<note place="marg">The lord deputie taketh a great preie vpon the Oneile.</note>
at Drogheda did also issue out, and in one morning tooke a preie of two
thousand kine, 500 garrons, and innumerable other small beasts and cattell.
The rebell seeing himselfe thus distressed of his goods, and forsaken of his helps and
followers, his men, some by Odonell, and some by others to the number of thr&eacute;e or
foure thousand persons at times slaine, himselfe discomfited, his passages stopped, and
<note place="marg">The Oneile distressed of all comfort is in doubt what to doo.</note>
all places of his refuge preuented, and now but one poore castell left wherein he
trusted to commit himselfe vnto; he being thus weakened, and beholding his declination
and fall towards, was fullie bent and determined to disguise himselfe, and so
as not knowne to come with a collar or halter about his necke to the presence of
the lord deputie, and in all humble and lowlie maner to submit himselfe: hoping
<note place="marg">Oneile his owne conscience condemneth him to s&eacute;eke submission.</note>
that by this kind of humilitie to find mercie at hir maiesties hands. But his conscience
was so cauterised, and his hands so imbrued with infinit and most horrible murthers,
bloudsheds, treasons, whoredomes, drunkennesse, robberies, burnings, spoiles,
oppressions, and with all kinds ofwickednesse, that his heart was ouerlaied and ouerladen
with an vtter despaire to obteine anie grace or fauor: and therefore was the
more easilie persuaded by those whome he tooke to be his friends, to trie first and
to intreat the Scots for friendship, and that they would ioine and aid him in his
most wicked rebellion. Wherevpon he tooke his iournie towards Clandeboie, where
<note place="marg">Oneile s&eacute;eketh for helpe of the Scots.</note>
Alexander Og and his companie, to the number of six hundred persons, were then
incamped: and for the better gaining of his purpose, he had a little before inlarged

<p>The Scots disguised the matter with him, pretending and promising him aid and
<note place="marg">The Scots doo disguise with Oneile.</note>
assistance: which they ment not. For assoone as Oneile togither with Odonels wife,
whom he kept, &amp; the small companie which he brought with him were come into the
tent, and they assured of him; they called to remembrance the manifold iniuries which
they had receiued at his hands, and namelie the murthering of one Iames Mac Conell,

<note place="marg">Shane Oneil slaine by the Scots by a draught made by capteine Piers.</note>
and with their slaughter swords hewed him to peeces, and slue all those of his companie
that were with him: his bodie they wrapped in a Kernes shirt, and so without
all honor was carried to a ruinous church not farre off, and there interred; but after
a few daies he was taken vp againe by capteine Piers, by whose deuise this stratagem
or rather tragedie was practised, and his head was sundred from the bodie, and sent to
<note place="marg">Shane Oneils head set vpon the top of the castell of Dublin.</note>
the lord deptie, who caused the same to be set vpon a stake or pole on the top of
the castle of Dublin. A fit end for such a beginning, and a iust reward for such a
wicked traitor and sacrileger: who began his tyrannie in bloud, did continue it with
bloud, and ended it with blond. The lord deputie being then at Drogheda, and aduertised
of the death of this Shane, and of the iust iudgements of God laid vpon him;
for the same prostrated himselfe before the high and eternall God, and gaue his most
humble and hartie thanks for the deliuerie of that land from so wicked a tyrant, sacriliger
and traitor; and with all the conuenient sp&eacute;ed that might be, he dispatched the
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;ene aduertised of Shane Oneils death.</note>
messengers to hir maiestie and conncell, aduertising this hap and good successe.
Which doone, his lordship with all sp&eacute;ed made his repaire into Vlster, and incamped
himselfe in the middle and heart of the countrie, vnto whome all the noblemen and
gentlemen of Tiron, being glad that they were deliuered from the tyrant, made their
repaire vnto his lordship: and especiallie all they which were competitors of the capteinrie
<note place="marg">The noblemen of Vlster, being glad of Oneils death do submit themselues.</note>
of Tiron, who most humblie and obedientlie presented and submitted themselues
vnto hir highuesse. And when his lordship had set all things in such order as
the time required, he assembled all the gentlemen of the countrie, and most pithilie
and effectuallie instructed and persuaded them to obedience, teaching them the great
blessings of God which commeth thereby, as also putteth them in mind what inconueniences,
miseries and calamities they had felt by the contrarie: and for their greater
quietnesse and peace, he promised shortlie to send commissioners amongst them, who
should haue authoritie to decide all controuersies betweene partie and partie (title of
land and death of man excepted.)</p>
<p>Also he proclamed and commanded hir maiesties peace to be kept, and commanded
<note place="marg">Orders giuen by the lord deputie to the noble men of Vlster.</note>
all churchmen and husbandmen to returne to their accustomed exercises: and that
all men of warre should liue vpon their owne, or vpon that which their fr&eacute;ends with
a good will would giue them: and so publishing peace uniuersallie, enerie man departed
home ioifillie. The lord deputie likewise returned to Dublin, and commanded
<note place="marg">Oneils sonne is c&omacr;mitted to safe custodie.</note>
the sonne of the late rebell, who laie for an hostage of his father, to be safelie kept in
the castell of Dublin, according to hir maiesties letters of commandement in that
behalfe, dated the sixt of Iulie 1567. The qu&eacute;enes maiestie being deliuered from this
traitorous rebell, and hauing all Vlster at hir commandement and disposition, was
verie desirous to haue a true plot of the whole land, wherby she might in some sort
see the same, &amp; did send ouer into Ireland one Robert L&eacute;eth, skilfull in that art, and
<note place="marg">Robert L&eacute;eth sent into Ireland to draw a true plot of the whole land.</note>
that he should make the perfect descriptions of the same. Likewise also she being
auertised of the outragious dealings of the earle of Desmond, in mainteining proclamed
rebels, and continuing of warres against the earle of Ormond (whose insolencie
to s&eacute;eke to be reuenged vpon the said earle, was the disturbance of the whole
realme, the spoile of the whole countrie, and the onelie cause of great murthers,

were descended vnto him: he made the qu&eacute;ens maiestie and councell acquainted
therewith, and praied that with their fauor and furtherance he might haue
libertie to follow, and by order of law to recouer the same. Which was granted
vnto him, as also he had hir highnesse and their lordships seueral letters to them,
then lords iustices and officers there to that effect: and willing them to aid and

assist him with all such hir maiesties euidences remaining in the records of the
castell of Dublin, or else where in that land; and by all such other good meanes
they might. Wherevpon he sent the writer hereof to be his agent: who hauing by
search found his title to be good, and confirmed by sundrie records and presidents,
found in hir maiesties treasurie and castell of Dublin, answering and agr&eacute;eing
with the euidences of sir Peter Carew: then the said sir Peter passed in person
<note place="marg">Sir Peter Carew passeth into Ireland.</note>
into Ireland, and made title and claime to the lordship of Maston, then in the possession
of sir Christopher Chiuers knight, and to the baronie of Odron, then in the
occupation of the Cauenaughs.</p>
<p>The first, when it was found good in law, and sir Christopher Chiuers y&eacute;elded, and
compounded for it: the other was trauersed before the lord deputie and councell, and
vpon good and substantiall euidences, records, and proofes; a decr&eacute;e passed by the
lords of the councell, in the behalfe of sir Peter Carew, and the same confirmed by the

lord deputie, and by that meanes he recouered the possession of the baronie, which
was before taken from his ancestors; as the records doo impart, about the eighteenth
yeare of king Richard the second. But as for the marqueship of Corke, being a
matter of great weight and importance, and the prouince of Mounster then not
setled in anie quietnesse: he would not as then nor yet thought it good to deale

therein. Sir Henrie Sidneie, hauing spent a long time in England, was commanded
to returne to his charge in Ireland, where he arriued at Crag Fergus, in September
1568: and tooke the sword of gouernement vpon him, and so discharged the
lords iustices. And then he and the councell by their letters of the fourth of
Nouember 1568, did aduertise hir maiestie of the state that the said realme of
Ireland then stood in. Which in briefe consisted in these points immediatlie
following.</p>
<p>That sir Edmund Butler had made a preie in Shilelagh vpon Oliuer Fitzgarret,
<note place="marg">The state that Ireland stood in.</note>
and doone sundrie murders, burnings, and great spoiles vpon his countrie: who was
forthwith sent for, and refuseth to come, excusing that he had businesse about the
execution of certeine seruices in the counties of Kilkennie, and Tiporarie, and that
the residue of all Leinster was quiet. That Connagh was in indifferent good order,
<note place="marg">Connagh in reasonable peace.</note>
sauing some contention betw&eacute;ene the earle of Clanricard, and Mac William Enter;
and an old controuersie renewed betw&eacute;ene Odonell and Oconner Sligo for the title
of a rent in Enter, Connaghs countrie. In Thomond great complaints made against
the earle thereof, by Oshaghnes, who by reason of the oppression of the said earle, he
was compelled with his followers to forsake his countries. As for Mounster, it was all in
<note place="marg">Mounster out of order.</note>
disorder by the warres of Iames Fitzmoris of Desmond, against Fitzmoris baron of
Lixenew: and of the earle of Clancart, against the baron of Roch: and also by the
disorders of Edward Butler, who being combined with Piers Grace and certeine outlawes,
did disorderlie spoile and preie the countries to f&eacute;ed their bellies.</p>
<p>The present state of Vlster the lord deputie being desirous to know the certeintie
thereof, immediatlie vpon his landing in Ireland he made a iourneie throughout the
same, and found the Irishrie to stand in wauering terms: wherevpon he sent
for Turlogh Lenogh Oneile, who y&eacute;elding himselfe somewhat guiltie, because he
somewhat swarued from his dutie, and differed from the articles in his lordships absence
<note place="marg">Turlogh Lenogh breaketh the peace, but submitteth himself.</note>
before, concluded with him in making a iourneie vpon Ferneie, and in combining
with the Scots, of whome he had in retinue about one thousand; he desired
pardon: which it was long and verie hardlie obteined, and not vntil his lordship had
caused the pledges to be executed, which the Scots had put in for their loialtie.
Odoneile quietlie possessed the countrie of Trireconell, and continued a dutifull subiect
to hir maiestie; sauing the old grudge betw&eacute;ene him and Turlogh did rather
increase than decaie. Ochan lord of the land betw&eacute;ene Loghfoile and the Ban,

being for the same sometime molested by Turlogh Lenogh, did beare with all iniuries,
and desired to be exempted from Turlogh, and to hold the same of the queenes
maiestie. The like did the two principall men, eligible for the capteinrie of Tiron,
desire for their parts all the residue of Vlster in good staie and quietnesse.</p>
<p>The lord deputie after this iourneie returned to Dublin, and there, when by the
aduise of the councell he had disposed all things in good order concerning the gouernement;
he caused the writs for summons of the parlement to be awarded out
vnto euerie noble man for his app&eacute;erance; &amp; to euerie shiriffe for choosing of
knights and burgesses for their like app&eacute;erance at Dublin the seuent&eacute;enth of Ianuarie,
in the eleuenth yeare of hir maiesties reigne; at which time and daie app&eacute;erance
<note place="marg">A parlement summoned at Dublin.</note>
was then and there made accordinglie. On the first daie of which parlement, the
lord deputie, representing hir maiesties person, was conducted and attended in most
honorable manner vnto Christes church, and from thense vnto the parlement house:
where he sat vnder the cloth of estate, being apparelled in the princelie robes of
crimson veluet doubled or lined with ermin. And then &amp; there the lord chancellor
made a verie eloquent oration, declaring what law was, of what great effect and
value, how the common societie of men was thereby mainteined, and each man in his
<note place="marg">The lord chancellor his oration.</note>
degr&eacute;e conserued; as well the inferior as the superior, the subiect as the prince:
and how carefull all good common-wealths in the elder ages haue b&eacute;ene in this
respect: who considering the time, state, and necessitie of the common-wealth, did
from time to time ordeine and establish most holsome lawes, either of their deuises,
or drawen from some other good common-wealth: and by these meanes haue prospered
and continued.</p>
<p>And likewise, how the qu&eacute;enes most excellent maiestie, as a most naturall mother
ouer hir children, and as a most vigilant prince ouer hir subiects, hath b&eacute;ene alwaies,
&amp; now presentlie is verie carefull, studious, &amp; diligent in this behalfe: hauing caused
this present parlement to be assembled, that by the councell and aduise of you hir
nobilitie, &amp; you hir knights and burgesses, such good lawes, orders, and ordinances
maie be decr&eacute;ed, as maie be to the honor of almightie God, the preseruation of hir
maiestie, and of hir imperiall crowne of this realme, and the safetie of the commonwealth
of the whole realme: for which they were not onelie to be most thankefull;
but also most carefull to doo their duties in this behalfe. And then he the lord speaker
directing his speeches to the knights and burgesses, who were there in the behalfe
of the whole commons of the realme, willed them that for the auoiding of confusion,
and for an orderlie proc&eacute;eding in this action: they should assemble themselues at
and in the house appointed for that assemblie; and there to make choise of some
wise and sufficient man to be their mouth &amp; speaker. And then concluding with
an exhortation of obedience and dutifulnesse, he ended, and the court adiourned
vntill thursdaie next, the twentith of Ianuarie. In the meane time, the knights and
burgesses met in the lower house, and appointed for their speaker one Stanihurst,
recorder of the citie of Dublin, a verie graue, wise, and learned man; who vpon
<note place="marg">Stanihurst chosen to be speaker of the lower house.</note>
thursdaie aforesaid was presented to the lord deputie, and to the lords of the higher
house: &amp; then he hauing doone most humblie his obedience and dutie, made his
oration and speech; first abasing himselfe, being not a man sufficientlie adorned and
furnished with such gifts of knowledge and learning, as to such an office and calling
dooth apperteine: wherein he was so much the more vnfit, as the cause he had in
<note place="marg">Stanihursts oraion.</note>
hand was of great weight and importance. And therefore he wished, if it might so
s&eacute;eme good to his lordship, some man of more grauitie, and of better experience,
knowledge, and learning might supplie the place. Neuerthelesse, for somuch as he
might not refuse it, he was the more willing, because he did well hope his seruice being

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"doone"</fw>-->


<pb n="342"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"342"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>-->


doone with his best good will, and in all dutifulnesse, it would be accepted. And
againe his comfort was the more, because he had to deale in such a cause, as was for
the establishing of some good and holsome lawes, whereof he was a professor.</p>
<p>And herevpon he tooke an occasion, according to the argument that was before
handled by the lord chancellor, speaker in the higher house, to discourse of the
nature and good effect of lawes, and what good successe there insueth to all such
realmes, countries, and common-wealths, as by lawes are well ruled &amp; gouerned.
And when he had spoken at large hereof, there he declared what great causes that
realme of Ireland had, to giue for euer most hartie thanks and praises to God for his
goodnesse, in sending such a vertuous, noble, and a most godlie prince, as was hir
maiestie; who not onlie was carefull by the sword to stand in their defense against all
enimies, traitors, and rebels, in times of wars and rebellions: but also for their conseruation
in times of peace would haue such lawes, statutes, and ordinances to be
made in a parlement of themselues, as should be most expedient for the commonwealth
of the same land. When he had at large discoursed of this matter, then he
concluded with an humble petition, that it might please hir maiestie to grant vnto
them their liberties and fr&eacute;edoms of old belonging to euerie assemblie of a parlement.
The first was, that euerie man being a member of the lower house, should and might
<note place="marg">The requests of the speaker for allowance of the liberties of the parlement house.</note>
haue fr&eacute;e comming and going to and from the parlement: and during their abode at
the same without molestation or impeachment of anie person or persons, or for anie
matter then to be laid against anie of them. The second, that they and euerie of
them might haue libertie to speake their minds fr&eacute;elie to anie bill to be read, &amp;
matter to be proposed in that parlement. Thirdlie, that if anie of the said house
shuld misorder and misbehaue himselfe in anie vndecent manner, or if anie other
person should euill intreat or abuse anie of the said house, that the correction and
punishment of euerie such offendor should rest and remaine in the order of the said
house. When he had ended his sp&eacute;ech, and in most humble maner doone his obeisance;
the lord deputie hauing paused vpon the matter, made answer to euerie
<note place="marg">The lord deputie answereth Stanihursts oration.</note>
particular point in most eloquent and effectuall manner, which consisted in these
points: Nothing misliking with the speaker for so much abasing of himselfe, because
he knew him to be both graue, wise, and learned, and verie sufficient for that
place, doubting nothing but that he would performe the same in all dutifulnesse,
as to him apperteined. And concerning the benefit which groweth to all nations
and common-wealths by the vse of the lawes; besides that dailie experience did
confirme the same generallie, so no one nation particularlie could better auouch
it than this realme of Ireland: and therefore he did well hope that they would
accordinglie frame themselues to liue accordinglie, and also to praie for hir maiesties
safetie and long life, whereby vnder hir they might inioie a peaceable and a quiet
life in all prosperitie. And concerning the priuileges, which they requested to
be allowed, forsomuch as the same at the first were granted to the end that they
might the better and more quietlie serue hir highnesse in that assemblie, to hir
honor, and to the benefit of the common-wealth, it pleased hir maiestie so long as
the were not impeached, nor hir imperiall state derogated, that they should inioie
the same. And so after a long time spent in this oration the court was adiourned.</p>
<p>The next daie following being fridaie the lower house met; and contrarie to the
order of that house, and dutie of that companie, in st&eacute;ed of vnitie there began a
diuision, and for concord discord was receiued. For all, or the most part of the
knights and burgesses of the English pale, especiallie they who dwelled within the
counties of Meth and Dublin, who seeing a great number of Englishmen to haue place
in that house began to except against that assemblie as not good, nor warranted by
<note place="marg">A mutinie in the lower house.</note>

law. Their vantparler was sir Christopher Barnwell knight, who being somewhat
<note place="marg">Sir Christopher Barnwell excepteth against the choise of the burgesses.</note>
learned, his credit was so much the more, and by them thought most m&eacute;etest and
worthie to haue b&eacute;ene the speaker for that house. And he being the spokesman
alleged three speciall causes, whie he and his complices would not y&eacute;eld their consents.
The first was, because that there were certeine burgesses returned for sundrie
townes, which were not corporat, and had no voice in the parlement. The second
was, that certeine shiriffes, and certeine maiors of townes corporat had returned
themselues. The third and ch&eacute;efest was that a number of Englishmen were returned
to be burgesses of such towns and corporations, as which some of them neuer knew,
and none at all were resiant &amp; dwelling in the same, according as by the lawes is
required.</p>
<p>These matters were questioned among themselues in the lower house for foure
daies togither, and no agreement: but the more words, the more choler; and the
more sp&eacute;eches, the greater broiles; vntill in the end, for appeasing the matter, the
same was referred to the lord deputie and iudges of the realme: vnto whom the said
speaker was sent to declare the whole matter, and to know their resolutions. And
they hauing at large discoursed and conferred of this matter, returned their answer;
that concerning the first and second exceptions, that the burgesses returned for
<note place="marg">The resolution of the iudges.</note>
townes not corporat, and for such shiriffes, maiors, and souereignes as haue returned
themselues, shall be dismissed out of the same: but as for such others as the shiriffes
and maiors had returned, they should remaine, and the penaltie to rest vpon the
shiriffes for their wrong returnes. The messenger of this answer, howsoeuer he
were liked, his message could not be receiued nor allowed: which being aduertised
<note place="marg">The disliking of the iudges opinions.</note>

<note place="marg">The selfewill and frowardnesse of the burgesse of the English pale.</note>
vnto the lord deputie and the iudges, then Lucas Dillon hir maiesties attorneie
generall was sent vnto them, to ratifie and confirme their resolutions: and yet could
not he be credited, neither would they be satisfied, vnlesse the iudges themselues would
come in persons and set downe this to be their resolutions. Vpon this answer the
speaker commanded a bill to be read, but the foresaid persons would not suffer nor
abide the reading thereof: but rose vp in verie disordered manner, farre differing
from their duties in that place, and as contrarie to that grauitie and wisedome,
which was or should be in them. Wherefore, for pacifieng of the same, the ch&eacute;efe
iustices of the qu&eacute;enes bench, and the ch&eacute;efe iustices of the common pl&eacute;es: the
queenes sergeant, attornie generall, and sollicitor, the next daie following came to
the lower house, and there did affirme their former resolutions, which thought it
might haue sufficed. Yet certeine lawiers who had place in that house, did not
altogither like thereof.</p>
<p>And albeit this matter were orderlie compassed, and sufficient to haue contented
euerie man: yet the same was so stomached, that the placing of the Englishmen
to be knights and burgesses, could not be digested, as did app&eacute;ere in the
sequele of that assemblie, where euerie bill furthered by the English gentlemen
was stopped and hindered by them. And especiallie sir Edmund Butler, who in all
<note place="marg">Sir Edmund Butler misliketh with the parlement.</note>
things which tended to the qu&eacute;enes maiesties profit or common-wealth, he was a
principall against it: fearing that their capteinries should be taken awaie, and coine,
and liuerie be abolished, and such other like disorders redressed, which he and his
complices misliking, it did euen open it selfe of a rebellion then a brewing and
towards. Which in d&eacute;ed followed. For immediatlie after the parlement, he returned
home with a discontented mind, and gathered his forces, and followed his
purpose. But to the purpose.</p>
<p>There were two billes put in of moment &amp; great consequence. The one was
concerning the repeale of an act for that sessions, onelie made in the time of sir
<note place="marg">The repeale of Poinings act.</note>
Edward Poinings lord deputie, in the tenth yere of king Henrie the seuenth, which

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"though"</fw>-->


<pb n="344"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"344"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>-->


though it were meant most for their owne benefit and common-wealth of that realme:
yet so gelous they were, that they would not in long time enter into the consideration
thereof. The other was for the granting of the impost for wines then first read.
<note place="marg">The act for imposts of wines.</note>
And in this matter they shewed themselues verie froward &amp; so vnquiet, that it was
more like a bearebaiting of disordered persons, than a parlement of wise and graue
men. Wherewith a certeine English gentleman (the writer hereof) being a burgesse
of the towne of Athenrie in Connagh, who had before kept silence, and still so meant
to haue doone; when he saw these foule misorders and ouerthwarting, being gr&eacute;eued,
stood vp, and praied libertie to speake to the bill, who made a preamble, saieng,
that it was an vsage in Pithagoras schooles, that no scholers of his should for certeine
yeares reason, dispute, or determine, but giue eare and keepe silence: meaning
that when a man is once well instructed, learned, and aduised, and hath well deliberated
of the things he hath to do, he should with more discretion and wisdome,
speake, order, and direct the same. Notwithstanding, now he being but a man of
small experience, and of lesse knowledge in matters of importance, and therefore
once minded to haue beene altogither silent, is inforced euen of a verie zeale and
conscience, and for the discharge of his dutie, to praie their patience, and to beare
with his speeches. And then vpon occasion of the bill read, and matter offered, he
entred into the discourse what was the office &amp; authoritie of a prince, and what was
the dutie of a subiect: and lastlie, how the queenes maiestie had most honorablie
and carefullie performed the one, and how vndutifullie they had considered the
other: for that she neither found that obedience in that land, which still liued in
rebellion against hir; neither that beneuolence of the better sort, which for hir great
expenses spent for their defenses and safeties they ought to haue y&eacute;elded vnto hir.
It appeered manifest in sundrie things, and speciallie in this present assemblie,
namelie one bill concerning the repeale of Poinings act, for this time onelie meant
for your owne benefit, and for the common-wealth of this realme: and the other
concerning the bill now in question, the one by you denied, and the other liketh
you not. And yet hir maiestie, of hir owne roiall authoritie, might and may establish
the same without anie of your consents, as she hath alreadie doone the like in England;
sauing of hir courtesie it pleaseth hir to haue it passe with your owne consents
by order of law, that she might thereby haue the better triall and assurance of your
dutifulnesse and goodwill towards hir. But as she hath and dooth find your bent
farre otherwise, so dooth the right honorable the lord deputie find the like. For
notwithstanding his long seruices in times past, his continuall and dailie trauels,
iorneies, and hostings, with the great perill of his life against the rebels for your
sake and safetie; and his endlesse turmoiles and troubles in ciuill matters and priuat
sutes for your quietnesse, and to you well known, he hath deserued more than well
at your hands: yet as the vnthankfull Israelites against Moses, the vnkind Romans
against Camillus, Scipio, and others: and as the vngratefull Atheniens against Socrates,
Themistocles, Meltiades, and others; you haue and doo most vngratfullie
requite and recompense this your noble gouernor: against whome and his dooings
you doo kicke and spurne what in you lieth. But in the end it will fall vpon you,
as it hath doone vnto others to your owne shame, ouerthrow, and confusion. And
when he had spent a long time in this matter, and prooued the same by sundrie
histories of other nations, he proc&eacute;eded to the bill, which by sundrie reasons and
arguments he prooued to be most necessarie, and m&eacute;et to be liked, allowed, and
consented vnto.</p>
<p>Now when he had thus ended his sp&eacute;eches, he sat downe, the most part of the
house verie well liking and allowing both of the person and of the matter; sauing
the persons before named, who did not heare the same so attentiuelie as they did

digest it most vnquietlie, supposing themselues to be touched herein. And therfore
some one of them rose vp and would haue answered the partie, but the time and
daie was so far spent aboue the ordinarie houre, being well n&eacute;ere two of the clocke
in the afternoone, that the speker and the court rose vp and departed. Howbeit
such was the present murmurings and threatnings breathed out, that the said gentleman
for his safetie was by some of the best of that assemblie conducted to the house
of sir Peter Carew, where the said gentleman then laie and resided. The lord deputie
in the meane time, hearing that the lower house were so close, and continued
togither so long aboue the ordinarie time, he doubted that it had b&eacute;ene concerning
the questions before proponed, and therefore did secretlie send to the house to learne
and know the cause of their long sitting. But by commandement of the speaker,
order was giuen to the doore-k&eacute;epers, that the doores should be close kept, &amp; none
to be suffered to come in or out, so long as the gentleman was in deliuerie of his
speeches; and after the court was ended, it was aduertised to the said lord deputie,
who thanked God that had raised vp vnknowen fr&eacute;ends vnto him in that place.</p>
<p>The next daie following being fridaie, assoone as the court of the lower house was
set, sir Christopher Barnewell, and the lawiers of the English pale, who had conferred
togither of the former daies sp&eacute;eches, stood vp and desired hearing: who leauing the
matter in question, did in most disorderlie manner inueigh against the said gentleman,
affirming, auouching, and protesting, that if the words spoken had b&eacute;ene
spoken in anie other place than in the said house, they would rather haue died than
haue borne withall. Wherevpon the speaker by consent of the residue of the house
commanded them to silence, and willed that if they had anie matter against the said
gentleman, they should present and bring it in writing against mondaie then next
following. And for somuch as their dealings then were altogither disordered, being
more like to a bearebaiting of lose persons than an assemblie of wise and graue men
in parlement; motion and request was made to the speaker, that he should reforme
those abuses and disordered behauiours; who not onelie promised so to doo, but also
praied assistance, aduise, and counsell for his dooings therein, of such as were acquainted
with the orders of the parlements in England. Which was promised vnto
<note place="marg">A booke of the orders of a parlement house imprinted for Ireland.</note>
him and performed, and also promised that a booke of the orders of the parlements
vsed in England should in time be set forth in print, which the said gentleman did,

king, hauing this authoritie, ought not to summon his parlement but for weightie
and great causes, and in which he of necessitie ought to haue the aduise and counsell
of all the estates of his realme, which be these and such like as foloweth.</p>
<p>First for religion, forsomuch as by the lawes of God and this realme, the king
next and immediatlie vnder God is his deputie and vicar in earth, and the chiefest
ruler within his realms and dominions: his office, function, and dutie is, aboue all
things to seeke and s&eacute;e that God be honored in true religion and vertue, and that
he and his people doo both in profession and life liue according to the same.</p>
<p>Also that all idolatries, false religions, heresies, schismes, errors, superstitions, &amp;
whatsoeuer is contrarie to true religion, all disorders and abuses, either among the
cleargie or laitie, be reformed, ordered, and redressed.</p>
<p>Also the assurance of the kings and queenes persons, and of their children, their
aduancement &amp; preferment in mariages, the establishing of succession, the suppression
of traitors, the auoiding or eschewing of warres, the attempting or moouing of
wars, the subduing of rebels, and pacifieng of ciuill wars and commotions, the leuieng
or hauing anie aid or subsidie for the preseruation of the king and publike estate:
also the making and establishing of good and wholesome lawes, or the repealing and
debarring of former lawes, as whose execution may be hurtfull or preiudiciall to the
estates of the prince or commonwealth.</p>
<p>For these and such like causes, being of great weight, charge and importance, the
king (by the aduise of his councell) may call and summon his high court of parlement,
and by the authoritie therof establish and order such good lawes and orders as then
shall be thought most expedient and necessarie.</p>
</div>

<div n="2" type="chapter">
<head>The order and maner how to summon the parlement.</head>
<p>The king ought to send out his writs of summons to all the estates of his reamd
at least fortie daies before the beginning of the parlement; first to all his lords an
barons, that is to wit, archbishops, bishops, dukes, marquesses, earls, vicounts and
barons; and euerie of these must haue a speciall writ. Then to the clergie, and the
writ of their summons must be addressed to euerie particular bishop for the clergie of
his diocesse. All these writs which are for the clergie, the king alwaies sendeth to
the archbishops of Canturburie and Yorke, and by them they are sent and dispersed
abroad to euerie particular bishop within their seuerall prouinces, and so the bishops
giue summons to the clergie.</p>
<p>Lastlie, for the summoning of the commons, he sendeth his writ to the lord
warden of the fiue ports, for the election of the barons thereof, and to euerie seuerall
shiriffe for the choise and election of knights, citizens, and burgesses within his
countie.</p>
</div>
<div n="3" type="chapter">
<head>How and what persons ought to be chosen for the clergie, and of their allowances.</head>
<p>The bishop ought vpon the receipt of the writ sent vnto him for the summoning
of his clergie, foorthwith to summon and warne all deanes and archdeacons
within his diocesse to app&eacute;ere in proper person at the parlement, vnlesse they haue
some sufficient and reasonable cause of absence, in which case he may app&eacute;ere by
his proctor, hauing a warrant or proxie for the same.</p>
<p>Then must he also send the like summons to the deane and chapter of his cathedrall
church, who shall foorthwith assemble their chapter, and make choise of some
one of themselues to app&eacute;ere in their behalfe, and this man thus chosen must haue
their commission or proxie.</p>

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"He"</fw>-->


<pb n="347"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"347"</fw>-->


<p>He must also send out his summons to euerie archdeaconrie and peculiar, requiring
that the whole clergie doo appeere before him, his chancellor or officer,
at a certeine daie, time, and place: who being so assembled, shall make choise and
election of two men of the said clergie to app&eacute;ere for them, and these shall haue
their commission or proxie for the same.</p>
<p>These proctors thus to be chosen ought to be graue, wise, and learned men, being
professors either of diuinitie or of the ecclesiasticall lawes; and that can, will, and
be able to dispute in cause of controuersie, conuincing of heresies, appeasing of
schismes, and deuising of good and godlie constitutions concerning true religion
and orders of the church.</p>
<p>These proctors (thus elected) ought to haue reasonable allowances for their
charges, according to the state, qualitie, or condition of the person, as also a respect
had to the time. The proctors of the deane and chapter are to be paid out of
the excheker of the cathedrall church. The proctors of the clergie are to be paid
of the clergie, among whom a collection is to be leuied for the same, according to
an old order vsed among them.</p>
</div>
<div n="4" type="chapter">
<head>How and what maner of knights, citizens, and burgesses ought to be chosen, and of their
allowances.</head>
<p>The shiriffe of euerie countie, hauing receiued his writs, ought foorthwith to
send his precepts and summons to the maiors, bailiffes, and head officers of euerie
citie, towne corporate, borough, and such places as haue b&eacute;ene accustomed to send
burgesses within his countie, that they doo choose and elect among themselues two
citizens for euerie citie, and two burgesses for euerie borough, according to their old
custome and vsage. And these head officers ought then to assemble themselues &amp;
the aldermen and common councell of euerie citie or towne, and to make choise
among themselues of two able and sufficient men of euerie citie or towne, to serue
for and in the said parlement.</p>
<p>Likewise at the next countie daie to be holden in the said countie after the receipt
of this writ, the shiriffe ought openlie in the court of his shire or countie,
betw&eacute;ene the houres of eight and nine of the forenoone, make proclamation; that
euerie freeholder shall come into the court, and choose two sufficient men to be
knights for the parlement; &amp; then he must cause the writ to be openlie &amp; distinctlie
read. Wherevpon the said freeholders, then and there present, ought to choose two
knights accordinglie, but he himselfe cannot giue anie voice, neither be chosen.</p>
<p>These elections aforesaid so past and doone, there ought to be seuerall indentures
made betw&eacute;ene the shiriffe &amp; the fr&eacute;eholders of the choise of the knights, and betw&eacute;ene
the maior and the head officers of euerie particular citie &amp; towne of the choise
of their citizens &amp; burgesses &amp; of their names, &amp; of their mainperners and suerties.
Of these indentures, the one part being sealed by the shiriffe, ought to be returned to
the clerke of the parlement; and the other part of the indentures, sealed by such as
made choise of the knights, &amp; such as made choise of the citizens &amp; burgesses vnder
the seuerall common seales of their cities and townes, ought to remaine with the
shiriffe, or rather with the parties so elected and chosen.</p>
<p>The charges of euerie knight and citizen was woont to be a like, which was thirteene
shillings and foure pence by the daie: but now by the statute it is but eight
shillings, that is, to euerie knight and euerie citizen foure shillings, and to euerie burgesse
the old vsage to haue fiue shillings: but now it is but thr&eacute;e shillings and foure
pence limited by the statute, which allowance is to be giuen from the first daie of their

that euerie such person shall be allowed for so manie daies as by iourneieng six and
twentie miles euerie daie in the winter, and thirtie miles in the summer, he may come
&amp; returne to and from the parlement.</p>
<p>In choise of these knights, citizens, and burgesses, good regard is to be had that the
lawes and customs of the realme be herein kept and obserued: for none ought to be
chosen, vnlesse he be resiant and dwelling within the shire, citie, or towne for
which he is chosen. And he ought to be graue, wise, learned, skilfull, and of great
experience in causes of policie, and of such audacitie as both can and will boldlie vtter
and speake his mind according to dutie, and as occasion shall serue; for no man
ought to be silent or dum in that house, but according to his talent he must and
ought to speake in the furtherance of the king and commonwealth.</p>
<p>And the knights also ought to be skilfull in martiall affaires, and therfore the
words of the writs are that such should be chosen for knights as be <emph>Cincti gladio:</emph>
not bicause they shall come into the parlement house in armour, or with their
swords: but bicause they should be such as haue good experience and knowledge in
feats of warre and martiall affaires, whereby they may in such cases giue the king and
relme good aduise and counsell. Likewise they ought to be laie men, and of good
fame, honestie, and credit, being not outlawed, excommunicated, or periured, or otherwise
infamous: for such persons ought not to haue place or be admitted into the parlement
house.</p>

<p>In the first sitteth the king, and his lords spirituall and temporall, called by the

</div>

<div n="7" type="chapter">
<head>Of the higher house.</head>
<p>The higher house (as is said) is where the king and his barons doo sit in parlement,
where the king sitteth highest, and the lords &amp; barons beneath him, each
man in his degr&eacute;e: the order is this. The house is much more in length than
in breadth, and the higher end thereof in the middle is the kings seat or throne
hanged richlie with cloth of estate, and there the king sitteth alwaies alone. On
his right hand there is a long bench next to the wall of the house, which reacheth
not so farre vp as the kings seat, and vpon this sit the archbishops and bishops,
euerie one in his degr&eacute;e. On his left hand there are two like benches, vpon the
inner sit the dukes, marquesses, earles and vicounts. On the other, which is
the hindermost &amp; next to the wall, sit all the barons euerie man in his degree.
In the middle of the house, betw&eacute;ene the archbishops seat and the dukes seat,
sitteth the speaker, who commonlie is lord chancellor, or keeper of the great seale
of England, or the lord chiefe iustice of England, as pleaseth the king, who dooth
appoint him: and he hath before him his two clerks sitting at a table before them,
vpon which they doo write and laie their bookes. In the middle roome beneath
them sit the chiefe iustices and iudges of the realme, the barons of the excheker, the
kings sergeants, and all such as be of the kings learned councell, either in the common
lawes of the realme, or of the ecclesiasticall laws, and all these sit vpon great wooll
sacks, couered with red cloth.</p>
<p>At the lower end of all these seats is a barre or raile, betw&eacute;ene which &amp; the
lower end of the house is a void roome seruing for the lower house, and for all
sutors that shall haue cause and occasion to repaire to the king or to the lords. This
house as it is distinct from the others, so there be distinct officers to the same belonging
and apperteining, which all be assigned and appointed by the king, and
all haue allowances for their charges at the kings hands, of which officers what they
are, what is euerie of their offices, and what allowances they haue, shall be written in

<p>Likewise he must make the like on the last daie of the parlement. And you shall

choise of two of the kings learned councell there being, to be the messengers
thereof.</p>
<p>If any bill or message be sent from the lower house, he must come from
his place to the bar, and there receiue the same; and being returned to his

as in times past haue apperteined, and b&eacute;ene vsed in that house.</p>
<p>Then, that cuerie one of that house maie haue libertie of sp&eacute;ech, and fr&eacute;elie to
vtter, speake, and declare his mind and opinion to anie bill or question to be
proponed.</p>
<p>Also, that cuerie knight, citizen, and burgesse, and their seruants, maie haue
free comming and going to and from the said parlement, as also during the said time
of parlement; &amp; that they, nor anie of their seruants or retinue to be arrested, molested,

<p>And lastlie, that if he or anie other of that companie, b&eacute;eing sent or come to him of
anie message, and doo mistake himselfe in dooing thereof, that his maiestie will not
take the aduantage thereof, but gratiouslie pardon the same.</p>
<p>He must haue good regard, and s&eacute;e that the clearke doo enter and make
true records, and safelio to keepe the same, and all such bils as be deliuered into
that house.</p>
<p>He must on the first and third daie, and when soeuer he else will, call the house by
name, and record their defaults.</p>
<p>All bils, to be brought and to be presented into that house, he must receiue &amp; deliuer
to the clearke.</p>
<p>He ought to cause and command the clearke to reade the bils brought in,
plainelie, and sensiblie; which doone, he must br&eacute;eflie recite and repeat the effect
and meaning thereof.</p>
<p>Of the bils brought in he hath choise, which and when they shall be read: vnlesse
order by the whole house be taken in that behalfe.</p>
<p>Euerie bill must haue thr&eacute;e readings, and after the second reading he must cause
the clearke to ingrosse the same, vnlesse the same be reiected and dashed.</p>
<p>If anie bill or message be sent from the lords, he ought to cause the messengers
to bring the same vnto him, and he to receiue the same openlie; and they being departed
and gone, he ought to disclose and open the same to the house.</p>
<p>If when a bill is read, diuerse doo rise at one instant to speake to the same, and
it cannot be discerned who rose first; then shall he appoint who shall speake:
neuerthelesse, euerie one shall haue his course to speake if he list.</p>
<p>If anie speake to a bill and be out of the matter, he shall put him in remembrance,
and will him to come to the matter.</p>
<p>If anie bill be read thr&eacute;e times, and cuerie man haue spoken his mind; then shall
he aske the house whether the bill shall passe or not? saieng thus: As manie as
will haue this bill passe in maner &amp; forme as hath b&eacute;ene read; saie Yea: then
the affirmatiue part saie Yea. As manie as will not haue this bill passe in maner
and forme as hath beene read, saie No. If vpon this question the whole house, or
the more part, doo affirme and allow the bill: then the same is to be sent to the
higher house to the lords. But if the whole house, or the more part doo denie the
bill; then the same is to be dashed out, and to be reiected: but if it be doubtfull
vpon giuing voices, whether side is the greater; then must a diuision be made
of the house, and the affirmatiue part must arise and depart into the vtter roome,
which (by the sergeant) is voided before hand of all persons that were there.
And then the speaker must assigne two or foure to number them first which sit
within, and then the other which be without, as they doo come in, one by one:
and as vpon the triall the bill shall be allowed or disallowed by the greater number:
so to be accepted as is before said.</p>

<p>But as the barons and lords of the parlement haue their house seuerall and distinct
from the commons: euen so the archbishops and bishops doo sequester themselues,
and haue a house seuerall from the residue of the clergie. And this their house is
called the higher conuocation house, the other being named the lower conuocation
house. Both these houses haue their seuerall officers, orders, and vsages; and each
officer hath his peculiar charge and function; as also certeine allowances, euen as
is vsed in the parlement houses of the lords and commons.</p>
<p>The archbishops and bishops doo sit all at a table, and doo discourse all such causes

Of the king, his office and authoritie.</head>
<p>HAUING declared of all the estates, degrees, and personages of the parlement, it
resteth now to speake also of the king, and of his office, who is all in all, the beginning
and ending, and vpon whome resteth and dependeth the effect &amp; substance of the
whole parlement. For without him and his authoritie nothing can be doone, and with
it all things take effect. Neuerthelesse, when he calleth &amp; assembleth his parlement,
there are sundrie orders which of him are to be obserued, and which he ought to see
to be kept and executed; or else the parlement ceasseth to be a parlement, and taketh
not his effect, of which orders these be the ch&eacute;efe which doo insue.</p>
<p>First, the king ought to send out his summons to all the estates of his realme, of
a parlement, assigning and appointing the time, daie, and place.</p>
<p>Also his summons must be at the least fortie daies before the beginning of his parlement.</p>
<p>Also he must appoint and prouide all such officers as ought to attend the parlement,
who must be found at his charges.</p>
<p>Also the king ought not to make anie choise, or cause anie choise to be made of
any knight, citizens, burgesses, proctors of the clergie, speaker of the common house,
or proloquutor of the conuocation house: but they must be elected and chosen by the
lawes, orders, and customs of the realme, as they were woont and ought to be, and
the kings good aduise yet not to be contemned.</p>
<p>Also the king ought to grant, permit, and allow to all and euerie of the estates,
and to euerie particular man lawfullie elected, and come to the parlement, all and
euerie the ancient freedoms, priuileges, immunities, and customs, during the parlement;
as also during the times and daies, comming and going to and from the parlement:
but yet the same humblie to be requested of his highnesse by the speaker in
his oration at the beginning of the parlement.</p>
<p>Also the king in person ought to be present in the parlement thr&eacute;e daies at the
least, during the time of the parlement; that is to saie, the first daie, when the whole
estates according to the summons make their appearance, which is called the first
daie of the parlement. On the second daie, when the speaker of the common house
is presented, which is counted the beginning of the parlement. And the third daie,
which is the last day, when the parlement is proroged or dissolued: for vpon these
daies he must be present, vnlesse in case of sicknes, or absence out of the realme, for
in these cases the king may summon his parlement by commission, and the same is of
as good effect as if he were present in person: and as for anie other daies, he is at his
choise and libertie to come or not to come to the parlement.</p>
<p>Also the king ought to propone to the parlement house in writing all such things
&amp; matters of charge, as for which he calleth the said parlement. And accordinglie
as the same shall then by the consent of all estates be aduised, concluded, and
agr&eacute;ed: so the king either hath to allow or disallow the same, for he can (of himselfe)
neither adde nor diminish anie bill; but accept the same as it is presented vnto
him from the estates of the parlement, or else altogither reiect it.</p>
<p>Also the king as he dooth prefix and assigne the daie and time when the parlement
shall begin; so also he must assigne &amp; appoint the time when the same shall be proroged
or dissolued: which ought not to be as long as anie matters of charge, weight,
or importance be in question, and the same not decided nor determined.

Of the dignitie, power, and authoritie of the parlement, and of the orders of the same.</head>
<p>THE parlement is the highest, cheefest, and greatest court that is or can be within
the reahne: for it consisteth of the whole realme, which is dinided into thr&eacute;e estates;
that is to wit, the king, the nobles, and the commons, euerie of which estates are subiect
to all such orders as are concluded and established in parlement.</p>
<p>These thr&eacute;e estates may iointlie and with one consent or agreement establish and
enact anie lawes, orders, and statutes for the common wealth: but being diuided, and
one swaruing from the other, they can doo nothing. For the king, though he be the
head, yet alone can not make anie law; nor yet the king and his lords onelie, nor yet
the king and his commons alone; neither yet can the lords and the commons without
the king doo anie thing of anaile. And yet neuerthelesse, if the king in due order
haue summoned all his lords and barons, and they will not come, or if they come
they will not yet app&eacute;ere; or if they come and appeere, yet will not doo or y&eacute;eld to
any thing, then the king with the consent of his commons (who are represented by
the knights, citizens, and burgesses) may ordeine and establish anie act or law, which
are as good, sufficient, and effectuall, as if the lords had giuen their consents.</p>
<p>But of the contrarie, if the commons be summoned and will not come, or comming
will not app&eacute;ere, or app&eacute;ering will not consent to doo anie thing, alleging some iust,
weightie, and great cause; the king (in these cases) cannot with his lords deuise,
make, or establish anie law, the reasons are these. When parlements were first began
&amp; ordeined, there were no prelats or barons of the parlement, and the temporall lords
were verie few or none, and then the king and his commons did make a full parlement,
which authoritie was hitherto neuer abridged. Againe, euerie baron in parlement
dooth represent but his owne person, and speaketh in the behalfe of himselfe alone.</p>
<p>But in the knights, citizens, and burgesses are represented the commons of the
whole realme; and euerie of these giueth not consent onlie for himselfe, but for all
those also for whome he is sent. And the king with the consent of his commons had
euer a sufficient and full authoritie to make, ordeine, and establish good and wholesome
lawes for the commonwealth of his realme. Wherfore the lords being lawfullie
summoned, and yet refusing to come, sit, or consent in parlement, can not
by their follie abridge the king and the commons of their lawfull proc&eacute;eding in parlement.</p>
<p>The
lords and commons in times past did sit all in one house, but for the auoiding
of confusion they be now dinided into two seuerall houses, and yet neuerthelesse they
are of like and equall authoritie, euerie person of either of the said houses being
named and counted a p&eacute;ere of the realme (for the time of the parlement) that is to
saie, equall: for <emph>Par</emph> is equall. And therefore the opinion, censure, and iudgement
of a meane burgesse, is of as great auaile as is the best lords, no regard being
had to the partie who speaketh, but the matter that is spoken.</p>
<p>They be also called p&eacute;ers, as it were fathers, for <emph>Pier</emph> is a father, by which is meant
that all such as be of the parlement should be ancient, graue, wise, lerned, and expert
men of the land: for such were the senators of Rome, and called <emph>Patres conscript,</emph>
for the wisedome and care that was in them in gouerning of the commonwealth.
They are also called counsellors, because they are assembled and called
to the parlement for their aduise and good councell, in making and deuising of such
good orders and lawes as may be for the commonwealth.</p>
<p>They therefore which make choise of knights, citizens and burgesses, ought to be well

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"aduised"</fw>-->


<pb n="359"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"359"</fw>-->


aduised that they doo elect and choose such as being to be of that assemblie, and
thereby equall with the great estates, should be graue, ancient, wise, learned, expert
and carefull men for their commonwealth, and who (as faithfull and trustie councellors)
should doo that which should turne and be for the best commoditie of
the commonwealth, otherwise they doo great iniurie to their prince and commonwealth.</p>
<p>Also
cuerie person of the parlement, during the times of the parlement, and at
his comming and going from the same, is fr&eacute;e from all troubles, arrests and molestations:
no action or sute taking effect which during that time is begun, entred, or
commensed against him, in what court so euer the same be, except in causes of treason,
murther, and fellonie, and except also executions in law, awarded and granted before
the beginning of the parlement.</p>
<p>Also euerie person hauing voices in parlement, hath free libertie of speach to
speake his mind, opinion, and iudgement, to anie matter proponed; or of himselfe
to propone anie matter for the commoditie of the prince and of the commonwealth:
but hauing once spoken to anie bill, he may speake no more for that
time.</p>
<p>Also euerie person once elected &amp; chosen a knight, citizen or burgesse, and returned,
cannot be disnissed out of that house; but being admitted, shall haue his
place and voice there, if he be a laieman. But if by errour a man of the cleargie be
chosen, then he ought and shall be dismissed; also if he be excommunicated, outlawed,
or infamous.</p>
<p>Also euerie one of these houses ought to be incorrupt, no briber nor taker of anie
rewards, gifts, or inonie, either for denising of anie bill, or for speaking of his mind;
but to doo all things vprightlie, and in such sort as best is for the king and
commonwealth.</p>
<p>Also euerie one ought to be of a quiet, honest and gentle behauiour; none taunting,
checking, or misusing an other in anie vns&eacute;einelie words or deeds: but all affections
set apart, to doo and indecuour in wisedome, sobrietie and knowledge, that which
that place requireth.</p>
<p>Also if anie one doo offend or misbehaue himselfe, he is to be corrected and punished
by the aduise and order of the residue of the house.</p>
<p>Also all the prisons, wards, gailes, within the realme and the k&eacute;epers of the same
are at the commandement of the parlement, for the custodie and safekeeping or punishment
of all and euerie such prisoners, as shall be sent to anie of them by the said
parlement houses, or anie of them: howbeit most commonlie the tower of London
is the prison which is most used.</p>
<p>Also if anie one of the parlement house is serued, sued, arrested, or attached
by anie writ, attachment, or minister of the Kings bench, Common plees, Chancerie,
or what court so euer within this realme: the partie so troubled and making complaint
thereof to the parlement house: then foorthwith a sargeant at armes is sent
to the said court, not onelie aduertising that the partie so molested is one of the parlement
house; but also inhibiting and commanding the officers of the said court to call
in the said processe, and not to deale anie further against the said partie: for the parlement
being the hiest court, all other courts as inferior y&eacute;eld and giue place to the same.</p>
<p>Also as euerie one of the parlement house is free for his owne person, for all manner
of sutes to be commensed against him: so are also his seruants fr&eacute;e, and not to
be troubled nor molested; but being troubled, haue the like remedie as the maister
hath or may haue.</p>
<p>Also no manner of person, being not one of the parlement house, ought to
enter or come within the house, as long as the sitting is there, vpon paine of

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"imprisonment,"</fw>-->


<pb n="360"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"360"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>-->


imprisonment, or such other punishment as by the house shall be ordered and
adiudged.</p>
<p>Also euerie person of the parlement ought to k&eacute;epe secret, and not to disclose
the secrets and things spoken and doone in the parlement house, to anie manner of
person, vnlesse he be one of the same house, vpon paine to be sequestred out
of the house, or otherwise punished, as by the order of the house shall be appointed.</p>
<p>Also
none of the parlement house oaght to depart from the parlement, without
speciall leaue obteined of the speaker of the house, and the same his licence be also
recorded.</p>
<p>Also no person, being not of the parlement house, ought to come into the same,
during the time of the sitting: so euerie one comming into the same oweth a dutie
and a reuerence, to be giuen when he entreth and commeth in.</p>
<p>If a baron or a lord come and enter into the higher house, he ought to doo his
obeisance before the cloth of estate, and so to take his place.</p>
<p>Also when he speaketh, he must stand bareheaded, and speake his mind plainlie,
sensiblie, &amp; in decent order.</p>
<p>If anie come in message or be sent for to the higher house, they must staie at the
inner doore vntill they be called in, and then being entred, must first make their
obeisance; which doone, to go to the lower end of the house, and there to staie vntill
they be called: and being called, they must first make one lowe courtesie and obeisance,
and going forwards must in the middle waie make one other lowe courtesie;
and then being come foorth to the barre, must make the third courtesie; the like must
be doone at the departure.</p>
<p>Also when anie knight, citizen or burgesse dooth enter and come into the lower
house, he must make his dutifull and humble obeisance at his entrie in: and then
take his place. And you shall vnderstand, that as euerie such person ought to be
graue, wise, and expert; so ought he to shew himselfe in his apparell. For in time
past, none of the councellors of the parlement came otherwise than in his gowne, and
not armed nor girded with weapon. For the parlement house is a place for wise,
graue, and good men; to consult, debate, and aduise, how to make lawes and orders
for the commonwealth, and not to be armed as men readie to fight, or to trie matters
by the sword. And albeit the writ for the election of the knights haue expresse words
to choose such for knights as be girded with the sword; yet it is not meant thereby that
they should come and sit armed: but be such as be skilful in feats of armes, and besides
their good aduises can well serve in martiall affaires. And thus the Romane
senators vsed, who being men of great knowledge and experience, as well in martiall
affaires, as in politike causes, sat alwaies in the senat house and places of councell in
their gownes and long robes. The like also was alwaies and hath b&eacute;ene the order in
the parlements of this realme, as long as the ancient lawes, the old customes, and
good orders thereof were kept and obserued.</p>
<p>Also if anie other person or persons, either in message or being sent for, doo
come: he ought to be brought in by the sergeant, and at the first entring must
(following the sergeant) make one lowe obeisance, and being past in the middle waie,
must make one other; and when he is come before the speaker, he must make the
third, and then do his message; the like order he must k&eacute;epe in his returne. But
if he doo come alone, or with his learned councell, to plead anie matter, or to answer
to auie obiection: he shall enter, and go no further than to the bar within the
doore, and there to doo his three obeisances.</p>
<p>Also when anie bill is committed, the committ&eacute;es haue not authoritie to conclude,
but onelie to order, reforme, examine, and amend the thing committed vnto them,

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"and"</fw>-->


<pb n="361"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"361"</fw>-->


and of their dooings they must giue report to the house againe, by whome the bill is
to be considered.</p>
<p>Also euerie bill, which is brought into the house, must be read three seuerall
times, and vpon thr&eacute;e seuerall daies.</p>
<p>Also euerie bill, which vpon anie reading is committed and returned againe, ought
to haue his thr&eacute;e readings, vnles the committ&eacute;es haue not altered the bill in anie
substance or forme, but onelie in certeine words.</p>
<p>Also when anie bill vpon reading is altogither by one consent reiected, or by voices
after the third reading ouerthrown, it ought not to be brought anie more to be read,
during the sessions of parlement.</p>
<p>Also if anie man doo speake vnto a bill, and be out of his matter; he ought to be
put in remembrance of the matter by the speaker onelie and by none other, and be
willed to come to the matter.</p>
<p>Also whensoeuer anie person dooth speake to anie bill, he ought to stand vp, and
to be bareheaded, and then with all reuerence, grauitie, and s&eacute;emelie sp&eacute;ech to
declare his mind. But whensoeuer anie bill shall be tried either for allowances, or to
be reiected: then euerie one ought to sit, bicause he is then as a iudge.</p>
<p>Also euerie knight, citizen, and burgesse, before he doo enter into the parlement,
and take his place there, ought to be sworne and to take his oth, acknowledging
the king to be the supreme and onelie gouernour of all the estates within this realme,
as also to renounce all forren potentates.</p>

and baron (in his degr&eacute;e) ought to take his place.</p>
<p>This doone, the lord chancellor, or he whom the king appointeth to be the speaker
of that house, maketh his oration to the whole assemblie, declaring the causes whie
and wherefore that parlement is called and summoned, exhorting and persuading
euerie man to doo his best indeuour in all such matters as shall be in the said parlement
proponed, as shall be most expedient for the glorie of God, the honor of the
king, and the commonwealth of the whole realme. Then he directeth his talke
vnto the knights, citizens, and burgesses, aduertising them that the kings pleasure is,
that they doo repaire to their house; and there according to the old and ancient
custome, doo choose and elect some one, wise, graue, and learned man among themselues
to be speaker for them, and giueth them a daie when they shall present him to
the king. And these things thus doone, the king ariseth, and euerie man departeth.
This is accounted for the first daie of the parlement.</p>
<p>The second or third daie after, when the speaker is to be presented: the king
with all his nobles (in like order as before) doo assemble againe in the higher house,
and then come vp all the commons of the lower house, and then and there doo present
their speaker vnto the king. The speaker foorthwith maketh his dutifull obeisances;
beginneth and maketh his oration before the king, and prosecuteth such
matters as occasion serueth, and as is before recited in the office of the speaker; and

this doone, euerie man departeth. And this is accounted for the beginning of the parlement,
for before the speaker be presented, and these things orderlie doone, there
can no bils be put in, nor matters be intreated of.</p>
<p>Lastlie when all matters of weight be discussed, ended, and determined, the king
commandeth an end to be made. And that daie the king, his nobles, and commons
doo againe assemble in the higher house in their robes, and in like order as is before
recited, where the speaker maketh hic oration, and is answered by the lord chancellor
or speaker of the higher house. Then all the bils concluded and past in both houses,
that is to saie, in the higher house of the lords, and in the lower house of the commons,
are there read by the titles: and then the king giueth his consent or dissent to euerie
of them as he thinketh good. And when the titles of all the bils are read, the lord
chancellor or lord speaker, by the kings commandement, pronounceth the parlement
to be proroged or cleane dissolued. And this is called the last daie or the end of
the parlement, and euerie man is at libertie to depart homewards.</p>

<p>The mondaie following, sir Christopher Barnewell and his complices, hauing better
considered of themselues, were quiet and contented, and the parlement begun with
some troubles had his continuance and end with better successe. In the time
of this parlement, and after the same, sundrie grieuous complaints were exhibited
to the lord deputie and councell by the late wife of the deceased baron of Dunboin,
Mac Brian Arra, Oliuer Fitzgirald, sir William Ocarell, and diuerse others the qu&eacute;enes
good subiects, against sir Edmund Butler and his brethren, for sundrie routs and
riots, spoiles and outrages which they were charged to haue doone vpon hir maiesties
<note place="marg">Commissioners sent to heare the c&omacr;plaints made against the Butlers.</note>
subiects. Wherevpon first letters and then commissioners were sent in to the counties
of Kilkennie and Tiporarie for the hearing and redressing thereof: but they
returned without dooing of anie thing. For sir Edmund, conceiuing some hard dealings
to be meant toward him by the lord deputie, and minding to stand vpon his
defense and gard, did not app&eacute;ere before the said commissioners, but both he
and his brethren combined themselues with Iames Fitzmoris Odesmond, Mac Artie
<note place="marg">The noblemen and gentlemen in Mounster sent their messengers to the pope.</note>
More, Mac Donagh, and the seneschall of Imokilie and others of Mounster, who
before (and vnwitting the Butlers) had sent the vsurped bishops of Cashell and
Emelie togither with the yoongest brother of the erle of Desmond vnto the pope &amp;
to the king of Spaine, for reformation of the popish religion, &amp; for fr&eacute;eing the land
from the possession of hir maiestie and of the imperiall crowne. Which mater
in the end brake out into an open and actuall rebellion, and the lord deputie by proclamation
<note place="marg">The noblemen &amp; gentlemen in Mounster proclamed traitors.</note>

<note place="marg">Sir Peter Carew is c&omacr;manded to serue against the Butlers.</note>
published them all to be traitors, and against whom he prepared an hosting.
But before the same was fullie prepared, he sent his letters and commandement
vnto sir Peter Carew knight then being at Leighlin, to enter into the action
of warres against sir Edmund Butler, who being accompanied with capteine Gilbert,
capteine Malbie, capteine Basenet, and others, latelie sent vnto him from the lord
deputie, followed his commandement, and first assaulted the castell of Cloughgriman
<note place="marg">Cloughgriman taken.</note>
in the Dullogh belonging to sir Edmund Butler, and tooke it, and gaue the spoile
vnto the souldiers.</p>
<p>From thense they remooued to Kilkennie towne, where they laie for a time, where
a man of the earle of Ormonds, espieng vpon a certeine daie sir Peter Carew to be
walking in the garden of the castell of Kilkennie alone, he charged his peece, and
leueled the same vnto the said Peter Carew, and minded to haue discharged it vpon
<note place="marg">Sir Peter Carew in danger to haue b&eacute;ene killed.</note>
him out of a window in the castell. At which verie instant a chapleine of the said
earls &amp; his steward, comming by him, &amp; suspecting some euill thing towards, turned
vp the mouth of the p&eacute;ece, which therewith was discharged, and so no bodie hurt;
and vnderstanding the thing was meant against sir Peter Carew, blamed the fellow,

and for a time thrust him out of the house. Whilest these capteins laie at Kilkennie,
it was aduertised vnto them, that a great companie of the rebels were incamped about
thr&eacute;e miles out of the towne, &amp; were there marching in verie good order. Wherevpon
sir Peter Carew, being then the generall, assembled all the capteins, and taking
their aduise what was best to be doone, they concluded that Henrie Dauels a verie
<note place="marg">Henrie Dauels sent to discouer the enimie.</note>
honest and a valiant English gentleman, who had serued long in that countrie, and
was verie well acquainted, especiallie in those parts, for he had maried his wife out
of that towne, and him they sent out to discouer the matter, who about thr&eacute;e miles
off had the view, and espied a great companie of about two thousand, resting vpon a
little hill in the middle of a plaine, being all armed and marching in battell araie.
When he returned with this report, then sir Peter Carew appointed the voward to capteine
Gilbert, who togither with Henrie Dauels and twelue other persons of his companie
galloped before the rest, and finding as it was before aduertised, gaue the charge.
The residue of the companie followed with the like hast vnder sir Peter Carew, and then
<note place="marg">Sir Peter Carew and the English capteins giueth charge vpon the rebels &amp; haue the victorie.</note>
capteine Malbie, and capteine Basenet, s&eacute;eing and assured that all things were cleere
behind them, followed so n&eacute;ere, that all the companie euen as it were at one instant
gaue the like charge, where they slue foure hundred Gallowglasses at the least, besides
others. The residue of the companie were fled into the mounteins fast by, and
none or few escaped but the horsemen and Kerns. And of hir maiesties side no one
man slaine, but a man of capteine Malbies was hurt.</p>
<p>Sir Peter Carew, hauing had and obteined this victorie, and marching in good
order, did returne with all his companie to the towne of Kilkennie, euerie capteine
and souldier carieng two Gallowglasses axes in his hand, but left the spoile to their
followers. Sir Edmund Butler at this instant was not in the campe, but was at his
vncles house at dinner. The townesmen of Kilkennie were verie sorie for this the
slaughter of so manie men. And yet neuerthelesse not long after, Iames Fitzmoris
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris besiegeth Kilkennie.</note>
came to this towne, and besieged it; but the towne being well garonised with certeine
soldiers, &amp; they themselues well appointed, did so carefullie and narowlie looke to themselues,
that they defended and kept the towne, notwithstanding all his force. But
yet the countrie and other small townes did not so escape, for the countie of Waterford,
and the lord Powre, the countie of Dublin, and all the countrie were spoiled, preied,
and ouerrun; and among all others the old Fulco Quimerford a gentleman, of long
<note place="marg">Fulco Quimerford spoiled &amp; robbed.</note>
time seruant to thr&eacute;e earles of Ormond, was robbed in his house at Callon of two
thousand pounds, in monie, plate, and houshold stuffe, besides his corne and cattell.
When they had taken their pleasure in this countrie, they went to the countie of
Wexford, which thing had not lightlie b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene before, and at a faire kept then
at Enescorth, there the souldiers committed most horrible outrages, lamentable slaughters,
<note place="marg">A wicked masacre at Enescorth.</note>
filthie rapes, and deflourings of yoong women, abusing mens wiues, speiling the
towne, &amp; slaughtering of the men, and such as did escape the sword were caried captiues
<note place="marg">A wicked conspiracie and combining of the traitors.</note>
&amp; prisoners. From hense they went into Osserie and into the qu&eacute;enes countie,
and spoiled the countrie, burned townes and villages, murthered the people: and
then they met with the earle of Clancare, and Iames Fitzmoris Odesmond, with whom
they then combined; and agreed to cause Tirlough Lennough to procure in the
Scots, they sent new messengers to the pope, and to the king of Spaine. Finallie,
nothing was left vndoone, which might anie waies tend to the subuersion of hir maiesties
imperiall crowne of Ireland, and to discharge that land from all Englishmen
and English gouernement, and by these means (the English pale and the good cities
&amp; townes excepted) the most part, if not the whole land, was imbrued &amp; infected with
this rebellion.</p>
<p>The earle of Ormond himselfe, a man of great honour and nobilitie, was all this

time in England: but from time to time was aduertised of the troublesome state in
that land: and whereof no little detriment redounded to his lordship, by reason that a
great and most part of all his lordships throughout that land were spoiled and wasted,
<note place="marg">The earle of Ormonds lands spoiled.</note>
which did not so much gr&eacute;ene him as the follies of his brethren. For great were his
griefs, &amp; verie much was he vnquieted therewith: for when he bethought himselfe of
his brethren, nature mooued him, and reason persuaded him, that no such outragious
<note place="marg">The good affection of the earle of Ormond to his brethren.</note>
parts could proceed from them, which in anie waies should either concerne hir maiestie,
or the dishonour of him and his house, which hitherto hath be&eacute;ne alwaies found
sound and true. Wherefore, when he heard of anie matter against them herein, he
would plead their innocencies, and defend their causes, vntill such time as by credible
letters, aduertisements, and reports, he saw apparant matter and manifest proofes of
the contrarie. Which reports albeit they grecued him verie much, yet (as I said)
nothing gr&eacute;eued him more, than their disloialtie and breach of dutie against hir maiestie,
<note place="marg">The earle of Ormond offereth to serue against his brethren.</note>
and the dishonour of his owne house. Wherefore to acquite himselfe and his
dutie towards hir highnes: he offereth to serne against them &amp; others, by the sword,
or by some other means, to recouer and reclaime them.</p>
<p>Wherevpon hir maiestie, standing assured of his fidelitie, and hauing a speciall trust
in him, sent him ouer into Ireland, who arriued at Wexford the fouret&eacute;enth of August
1569, at that verie time when that wicked massaker was committed and doone at
<note place="marg">The earle of Ormond arriueth at Wexford.</note>

<note place="marg">The earle repaireth to the lord deputie.</note>
the faire at Innescorth. Immediatlie vpon his landing, he aduertiseth vnto the lord
deputie his comming, and with all conuenient sp&eacute;ed maketh his repaire vnto him, who
then was incamped and laie n&eacute;ere Limerike: and then and there offereth his seruice
with all his best power, and brought with him his brother Edmund Butler, who
in the open view and sight of the whole campe did y&eacute;eld and submit himselfe simplie
<note place="marg">Edmund Butler submitteth himfelfe.</note>
to hir maiesties mercie, confessing his follie and craning pardon. And then was he
deliuered to the earle his brother vpon his bonds, to b&eacute;e foorth comming before the
said lord deputie at his comming to Dublin: and also promised to doo the like with
his two other brothers, which he did vpon the sixt&eacute;enth of October 1569. At which
time when they all appeared before the lord deputie and councell, they were charged
with manie and sundrie things: but sir Edmund Butler for himselfe alledged, that
others were the causers whie he did that which he did. And for himselfe he alledged,
<note place="marg">Sir Edmund Butlers excuses.</note>
first that the lord deputie did not brooke nor like him, for he could haue no iustice at his
hands, nor against sir Peter Carew, who claimed and had entered vpon some part of
his lands, nor yet against any other person. Then that the said lord deputie had threatned
him that he would lie in his skirts, and would pull downe his loftie lookes.
Thirdlie, that the said lord deputie should go about to kill all the Butlers in Ireland,
and would then go into England, and there would doo manie things.</p>
<p>When all these things were heard at full, and nothing in proofe falling out as was
auouched, the thr&eacute;e brethren were committed to ward into the castell of Dublin, out
of which sir Edmund escaped, and made breach: neuerthelesse the earle brought him
againe. And vpon the last of Februarie 1569 he brought also his two other brethren,
<note place="marg"><date>1569</date></note>
for whome he had vndertaken, and presented them before the lord deputie and councell,
where the matter being heard at large, the councell conferred hereof among
themselues, and in the end they all the thr&eacute;e brethren were againe called before
the lord deputie and councell, and then and there kn&eacute;eling vpon their kn&eacute;es,
did confesse their follies, and submitted themselues in all dutifulnesse and simplicitie
to the qu&eacute;ens mercie: where the earle not onlie naturallie as a brother
made humble petition for them: but grauelie as a father recited their errors, reprooued
<note place="marg">The loue and grauitie of the earle of Ormond to his brethren.</note>
them of their outrages, and counselled them to their duties: and in the end condescended
in the due consideration of hir maiesties roiall estate. And therevpon they

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"were"</fw>-->


<pb n="365"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"365"</fw>-->


were committed to safe k&eacute;eping within hir maiesties castell of Dublin, at hir highnesse
disposition; and not long after vpon hope of amendment were pardoned. But to
the matter againe.</p>
<p>The lord deputie followed his first begun hosting, who when he was incamped neere
Clomnell, where it was thought he should haue b&eacute;ene fought withall, he wrote to the
maior and his brethren of the citie of Waterford, to send vnto him the assistance of a
<note place="marg">The citie of Waterford standing vpon their liberties refuse to send aid to the lord deputie.</note>
few souldiers onelie for thr&eacute;e daies; who did verie insolentlie and arrogantlie returne
an answer by waie of disputing their liberties with hir maiesties prerogatiue, and so
sent him no aid at all. Wherein the more they shewed their affection to the rebels;
the more was their ingratitude &amp; disloialtie to hir highnesse, the reward whereof
they felt in the end. The camp at this time being within half a mile of Clomnell, the
<note place="marg">The lord deputie went into Clomnell &amp; vseth verie good sp&eacute;eches vnto them.</note>
lord deputie before his dislodging from thense went into the towne, where the souereigne
and his brethren receiued him with all the honour they could, and gaue him
a banket in their towne-house, where, vnto them &amp; the whole multitude then present,
he made a verie eloquent speach, teaching them the dutifulnesse and obedience of a
subiect, and the great inconuenience which groweth by the contrarie to all commonwealths,
and each member of the same: and therefore laieng before them their present
estate for example, did mooue and persuade them to hold fast the dutie &amp; obedience
which they owght to hir maiestie, and not to be dismaid at the dooings of the
rebels and disobedient: who though for a time they had their will and pleasure, yet
God, in whose hand is the heart of the prince, and vnder whome all kings and princes
doo rule, hath b&eacute;ene alwaies, is, and will be, a swift reuenger against them for the
same: euen as of the contrarie he sendeth his manifold blessings of peace, wealth
and prosperitie to the obedient and dutifull subiect. And so hauing vsed sundrie and
notable sentences and examples to this effect, he left them and returned to his campe.</p>
<p>And from thense he remooued and marched towards Cashell, which lieth in the
countie of Tipporarie, n&eacute;ere vnto which place Edmund Butler had warded a castell:
who when he saw the armie approching, he set all the out houses on fire, and prepared
themselues to defend the pile. The lord deputie taking the same as a defiance, approched
therevnto and besieged it: and whilest the assault was in preparing, it was
y&eacute;elded by composition, and after restored to one Cantrell the owner thereof. From
thense by iourneies he marched and went to Corke, being met in the waie by the vicounties
of Roch and Barrie, and by sir Corman Mac Teege: and being aduertised
that Fitzedmund seneschall of Imokillie, a principall rebell, and combined with Iames
Fitzmoris, had spoiled and preied the whole countrie, and had also warded and vittelled
his castell of Balie martyr, which by his tenure he was of himselfe bound to mainteine
<note place="marg">Balie martyr a castell of the seneschals besieged and taken.</note>

<note place="marg">The seneschall escapeth out of his castell.</note>
and defend it, he marched thither and laid siege to the same, and in the end tooke it
full of vittels. But the seneschall in the dead of the night fled out through a hole of
the house in a bog, and there escaped.</p>
<p>The spoile was giuen to the souldiers, &amp; the castell with a gard of twentie men was
giuen to Iasper Horseie, &amp; so he returned to Corke, and from thense he tooke iourneie
to Kilmallocke, and finding that place most necessarie for a fort, he appointed and
named Humfreie Gilbert hir maiesties seruant to be coronell, and besides his owne
<note place="marg">Humfreie Gilbert made coronell of Mounster.</note>
band of an hundred horssemen he appointed foure hundred footmen, and certeine
Kernes there to remaine. And there he did knit and conioine vnto him by oth, and
vnder good pledges, the vicounties of Roch and Dessis, with the lord Powre, the lord
Courcie, sir Corman Mac T&eacute;ege, sir Donogh Clancartie, and Barrie Oge, and the
most part of the freeholders in the counties of Limerike and Corke. And this doone
he passed by iourneies to Limerike, and from thense he went to Gallewair, and there
established a president and a councell, and placed sir Edward Fitton to be lord president,

of that prouince y&eacute;elding to the same.</p>
<p>Thense he marched to Athlon, taking in the waie the castell of Rosocomen, whichhe
left with the ward of twentie horssemen, to Thomas le Strange, and there dismissed
the armie; but himselfe by iourneies trauelled and came to Dublin, and there remained.

<note place="marg">Capteine Gilberts good service.</note>
his valiancie and courage was such, and his good hap so well answering his woorthie
and forward attempts, that he in short time broke the hearts, and appalled the
courages of all the rebels in Mounster, and no rebell knowne left in effect, which dare
to withstand and make anie resistance against him. And to such an obedience he
brought that countrie, that none did or would refuse to come vnto him, if he were sent
for but by a horsse boy: for all y&eacute;elded vnto him, some by putting in recognisances,
&amp; some by giuing of pledges, and all in s&eacute;eking mercie and pardon.</p>
<p>And that proud earle of Clancare, which in his glorie not long before vsurped this
<note place="marg">The earle of Clancare submitteth himselfe to capteine Gilbert.</note>
name to be king of Mounster; euen he now, and Mac Donagh his chiefe follower,
went to Limerike vnto him, and there falling vpon their kn&eacute;es acknowledged their
tresons, and most humblie desired hir maiesties pardon: and offered to put in his
eldest sonne, and the sonnes of his chiefest fr&eacute;eholders for pledges and hostages.
Likewise the president of Connagh in such wisedome, courage, &amp; vprightnesse, directed
<note place="marg">The good seruice of sir Edward Fitton lord president of Connagh.</note>
his gouernement, that he was obeied of all the whole people in that prouince,

and by these meanes hauing rid awaie the most notable offendors and their fosterers,
the whole prouince rested in good quietnesse and in dutifull obedience to hir maiestie
and hir lawes.</p>

rebellion were conioined with the Butlers: these bordering vpon the frontiers appointed
to sir Peter Carew, were so by him chased and persecuted, that finding no
place of rest or quietnesse, he hath brought them to submit themselues simplie to
hir maiesties mercie, and haue put in their pledges to abide such orders and conditions
<note place="marg">Turlogh shot through with two bullets.</note>

out of a caliuer, by a ieaster or rimer of the Doniloghs. Wherevpon the Scots whome
he reteined were in a maze, and the countrie standing vpon the election of a new
capteine: howbeit, he was in hope of recouerie. And thus after long troubles was
the state of the whole realme recouered to quietnesse. Whervpon capteine Gilbert,
when he had setled Mounster in outward app&eacute;erance in a most perfect quietnesse, and
brought it to good conformitie: he made his repaire to Dublin to the lord deputie,
where he aduertised and recounted all his dooings at full.</p>
<p>And hauing matters of great importance in England, he desired licence to depart
ouer: whome the said deputie did not onelie most courtconslie receiue; but also most
thankefullie did accept his good seruice, and in some part of recompense, vpon Newyeares
daie in the church at Drogheda, he did bestow vpon him the order of knighthood;

personages, sir Peter Carew, and sir Humfreie Gilbert: both which were of one
countrie and birth, borne in the countie of Deuon, and of n&eacute;ere bloud, kinred, and
consanguinitie.</p>
<p>Sir Humfreie Gilbert, he was a second brother, and borne of a great parentage,
<note place="marg">The description of sir Humfreie Gilbert, and his descent.</note>
waase ancestors came and descended from the earle of Cornewall, a man of a higher
stature than of the common sort, &amp; of complexion cholerike; from his childhood of a
verie pregnant wit and good disposition: his father died leauing him verie yoong,
and he conceiuing some great good thing to come of his towardnesse, prouided some
portion of liuing to mainteine and k&eacute;epe him to schoole. And after his death, his
mother, being no lesse carefull of him, did cause him to be sent to schoole to Eton college:
from thense, after he had profited in the elements &amp; principall points of grammar,
he was sent to Oxford, &amp; did there prosper &amp; increase verie well in learning
and knowledge. And being (as his friends thought) verie well furnished, they would
haue put him to the ins of court. But an aunt of his, named mistres Katharine Ashleie,
who was attendant to the queenes maiestie, after that she saw the yoong gentleman,
and had had some conference with him, she fell in such liking with him, that she
preferred him vnto hir maiesties seruice: and such was his countenance, forwardnesse,
and behauiour, that hir maiestie had a speciall good liking of him; and verie
oftentimes would familiarlie discourse and conferre with him in matters of learning.
After a few yeares spent in the court, he passed ouer into Ireland, being commended
by hir highnesse to sir Henrie Sidneie then lord deputie: who gaue him interteinement,
and made him a capteine ouer an hundred horssemen: wherein he so well acquited
himselfe, that he was also made coronell of Mounster; and had appointed vnto him,
besides his owne band of one hundred horssemen, foure hundred footemen, besides
such Geraldines as Thomas of Desmond, brother to the erle of Desmond
had procured, &amp; vpon his oth of loialtie and pledges had promised his faithfull
seruice.</p>
<p>And albeit he were but yoong of yeares, which might s&eacute;eme to hinder his credit:
yet such was his deuout mind to serue hir maiestie, and so effectuallie to his great
praise he followed the same; that with manie good gifts and excellent vertues he
so supplied euen as much as manie men of elder yeares &amp; greater experience did
not commonlie atteine vnto. For in seruice vpon the enimie he was as valiant and
couragious as no man more; and so good was his hap to answer the same: for he
alwaies for the most part daunted the enimie, and appalled their courage; as did app&eacute;ere
in the ouerthrow giuen n&eacute;ere Kilkennie in the Butlers warres, when he with
twelue persons gaue the onset vpon a thousand men, of which six hundred were
armed Gallowglasses, who then were ouerthrowne: and likewise in Mounster, which
was altogither vp in rebellion; and he coronell, did not onelie in martiall affaires shew

the proudest of them to obedience, hauing vnder him but fiue hundred against sundrie
thousands; and inforced that proud earle of Clancart to follow him to Limerike,
and there humblie vpon his knees to aske pardon and mercie: but also, after that he
had subdued and ouercome them, did most vprightlie order and direct his gouernement,
and with all indifferencie would heare, decide, and determine the complaints
&amp; griefs, and compound all the causes of euerie sutor. Which was so rare a thing
in one of his yeares, as scarse was credible, had not eiewitnesses and dailie experience
prooued and iustified the same.</p>
<p>After that he had established peace and tranquillitie in that countrie, he went to
Dublin: where when he had recounted all his seruices, and the good successe thereof;
and in what quiet state he had left the countrie, he desired leaue to passe ouer into England,
for and about certeine matters of great importance, which he had to follow, which he

said) was honored and dubbed a knight; and with letters in his praise and commendation
to hir maiestie, and the lords of the councell, he departed. Assoone as he had
presented himselfe before hir highnesse, hir good countenance and fauour, in respect
of his good seruice to hir maiestie was increased and doubled; and he speciallie aboue
all others magnified and well accepted. Not long after, he was maried to a yoong
gentlewoman, and an inheritrix: and thensefoorth he gaue himselfe to studies perteining
to the state of gouernement, and to nauigations. He had an excellent and
readie wit, and therewith a toong at libertie to vtter what he thought. Which being
adorned with learning and knowledge, he both did and could notablie discourse anie
matter in question concerning either of these, as he made good proofe thereof, as well
in familiar conference with the noble, wise, and learned; as also in the open assemblies
of the parlements, both in England and in Ireland: in which he shewed the great
value of knowledge, wisedome, and learning which was in him, and the great zeale
he had to the commonwelth of his countrie. He had a great delight in the studie of
cosmographie, and especiallie in nauigations; and finding out by his studies, certeine
nations and vnknowne lands, which being found, might redound to the
great benefit of his countrie: he made hir maiestie acquainted therewith, and obteined
of hir a licence to make a nauigation, which he tooke in hand. But before he could

he of all his brethren had fiue sonnes and one daughter, children by their countenances

They heard no sooner of his comming, but as a sort of wasps they fling out, and revolting
<note place="marg">The rebelling of Mounster against the president.</note>
from their former feined obedience, became open rebelles and traitors vnder
Iames Fitzmoris an archtraitor, and as dogs they returne to their vomit, and as swine
to their durt and puddles.</p>
<p>And here may you see the nature and disposition of this wicked, effrenated, barbarous,
<note place="marg">The nature of the Irishmen.</note>
and vnfaithfull nation, who (as Cambrensis writeth of them) they are a
wicked and peruerse generation, constant alwaies in that they be alwaies inconstant,
faithfull in that they be alwaies vnfaithfull, and trustie in that they be alwaies
trecherous and vntrustie. They doo nothing but imagin mischeefe, &amp; haue no delite
in anie good thing. They are alwaies working wickednes against the good, and
such as be quiet in the land. Their mouths are full of vnrighteousnesse, and their
toongs speake nothing but curssednesse. Their feet swift to shed blood, &amp; their
hands imbrued in the blood of innocents. The waies of peace they know not, &amp; in
the paths of righteousnesse they walke not. God is not knowne in their land, neither
is his name called rightlie vpon among them. Their qu&eacute;ene and souereigne
they obeie not, and hir gouernment they allow not: but as much as in them lieth doo
resist hir imperiall estate, crowne, and dignitie. It was not much aboue a yeare
past, that capteine Gilbert with the sword so persecuted them, and in iustice so executed
them, that then they in all humblenesse submitted themselues, craued pardon,
and swore to be for euer true and obedient: which, so long as he maistered and kept
them vnder, so long they performed it; but the cat was no sooner gone, but the
mise were at plaie; and he no sooner departed from them, but foorthwith they
skipped out, and cast from themselues the obedience and dutifulnesse of true subiects.
For such a perverse nature they are of, that they will be no longer honest and obedient,
than that they cannot be suffered to be rebelles. Such is their stubbornesse
and pride, that with a continuall feare it must be brideled; and such is the hardnesse
of their hearts, that with the rod it must be still chastised and subdued: for no longer
feare, no longer obedience; and no longer than they be ruled with seueritie, no
longer will they be dutifull and in subiection; but will be as they were before, false,
trucebreakers &amp; traitorous. Being not much vnlike to Mercurie called quicke siluer,
<note place="marg">The nature of quicke siluer.</note>
which let it by art be neuer so much altered and transposed, yea and with fire consumed
to ashes; yet let it but rest a while vntouched nor medled with, it will returne
againe to his owne nature, and be the same as it was at the first. And euen so
dailie experience teacheth it to be true in these people. For withdraw the sword,
and forbeare correction, deale with them in courtesie, and intreat them gentlie, if they
can take anie aduantage, they will surelie skip out; and as the dog to his vomit, and
the sow to the durt &amp; puddle they will returne to their old and former insolencie,
rebellion, and disobedience. This is to be meant of the Irishrie and sauage people,
who the further they are from the prince and court, the further from dutie and obedience;
the more they are vnder their Obrian gouernment, the lesse dutifull to their
naturall souereigne and prince. But concerning the inhabitants in the English pale,
and all cities and towns, the contrarie (God be praised) is dailie seene.</p>
<p>Well, this worthie knight knowing that he should haue to doo with a sort of netles,
<note place="marg">The gouernment of sir Iohn Perot.</note>
whose nature is, that being handled gentlie, they will sting; but being hard crushed
togither, they will doo no harme: euen so he began with them. The sword and the
law he made to be the foundation of his gouernement, by the one he persecuted the
rebell and disobedient, and by the other he ruled and gouerned in iustice and iudgement.
<note place="marg">His seruise against the rebelles.</note>
Great troubles he had in both, but little he did preuaile in the latter, before he had
ouercome the first: and therefore minding to chastise the rebelles, and to bring them
to obedience, he followed and chased them from place to place: in the bogs he pursued
them, in the thickets he followed them, in the plaines he fought with them, and

in their castels and holds he beseeged them, and would neuer suffer them to be at rest
and quietnesse, vntill he had tired and wearied them out, and at length inforced Iames
Fitzmoris and his complices to come vnto Killmalocke vnto him, and there simplie to
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris seeketh for peace, and submitteth himselfe.</note>
submit himselfe, and vpon his knees in the open sight of all the people to confesse his
disloialties, and in all humble manner to craue mercie and pardon. Whome though
vntill hir maiesties pleasure knowne he did forbeare, yet the residue he spared not;
but after their deserts he executed in infinit numbers. And hauing thus rid the
garden from these w&eacute;eds, and rooted vp the fields from these thornes, he entreth into
the gouernement by order of law, and from place to place throughout all Mounster
<note place="marg">The ciuill governement of sir Iohn Perot.</note>
he trauelleth and k&eacute;epeth h&iuml;s sessions and courts, hearing euerie mans complaints,
and redresseth their gr&eacute;efs, and in short time brought the same to such a quietnesse
and peaceable estate, that whereas no man before could passe through the countrie,
but was in danger to be murdered and robbed, and no man durst to turn his cattell
into the fields without watch, and to keepe them in barnes in the night time:
now euerie man with a white sticke onelie in his hands, and with great treasures might

and did trauell without feare or danger where he would (as the writer hereof by triall
knew it to be true) and the white sh&eacute;epe did k&eacute;epe the blacke, and all the beasts laie
continuallie in the fields, without anie stealing or prcieng.</p>
<p>Now when he had thus quieted this prouince, and setled all things in good order,
then he beginneth to reforme their maners in life and common conuersation and
apparell, suffering no glibes nor like vsages of the Irishrie to be vsed among the men,
nor the Egyptiacall rolles vpon womens heads to be worne. Whereat though the ladies
and gentlewomen were somewhat greeued, yet they y&eacute;elded: and giuing the same ouer,
did weare hats after the English manner. In this his seruice he had two verie good
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn Perots assistants.</note>
&amp; notable assistants, the one concerning the martiall affaires, and the other for his
gouernement by the course and order of the law. Concerning the affaires martiall George
<note place="marg">George Burchier his birth and seruices.</note>
Bourchier esquier was ioined with him in commission, and did him notable good seruice,
he was the third sonne to Iohn earle of Bath, whose ancestors were descended
from out of the loines of kings, and men of great honor and nobilitie; and they were
no more noble of bloud than valiant, wise and prudent in all their actions, both in
the seruices of chiualrie and matters of policies, and whereof the histories of England
in manie places doo make mention and report. And this gentleman, hauing some
motion of the value and valiantnesse of his ancestors deriued and descended vpon
him, was affected and giuen to all feats of chiualrie, and especiallie to the seruice in
the warres, wherein he prooued a verie good souldior, and an expert capteine, both
as an horsseman, and as a footeman, both which waies he serued, as the seruice and time
required. If he serued vpon foot, he was apparelled in the manner of a Kerne and
a foot souldior, and was so light of foot as no Kerne swifter: for he would pursue
them in bogs, in thickets, in woods, in passes, and in streicts whatsoeuer; and neuer
leaue them, vntill he did performe the charge and seruice committed vnto him. If
he were to serue vpon his horssebacke, his dailie seruice can witnes sufficientlie how
much, and how often he preuailed against the enimie, and appalled their courages,
and with whome he would incounter if he might by anie meanes.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, as couragious and circumspect as he was, that he would not be
lightlie intrapped in the field, yet was he deceiued in the house. For vnder the colour
of a parl&eacute;e, and vpon a truce taken, he was inuited to a supper: and little thinking
that anie breach of the truce should be made, he went into the castell whereas he
<note place="marg">George Burchier taken prisoner.</note>
was bidden. But in his being there, he was taken prisoner, and handfasted, and so
kept for a space; but yet not long after he was restored and set at libertie. Concerning
his other assistant, his name was George Welsh borne in Waterford, and a gentleman
<note place="marg">George Welsh a lawier, well learned, and vpright.</note>
of an ancient familie, he was brought vp in learning, and was a student in the

innes of court at London, and prospered verie well therein: and albeit his yeares
were but yoong, yet his knowledge, grauitie, and sinceritie counteruailed the same
with an ouerplus. In deciding of all matters he was vpright and iust, being not
affectionated nor knowne to be corrupted for anie mans pleasure. In iudgement vpright,
in iustice seuere, and without respect of persons would minister what the law
had prescribed, he spared neither partie, nor would be affected to anie; by which
meanes he did maruellous much good in that seruice, and happie was that gouernor
that had so good a counsellor.</p>
<p>Immediatlie vpon the placing of this gouernement in Mounster, sir Henrie Sidneie
had libertie and licence to returne ouer into England, and receiued hir maiesties letters
dated the thirt&eacute;enth of December one thousand fiue hundred seuentie and one,
<note place="marg"><date>1571</date></note>

<note place="marg">Sir William Fitzwilliams made lord deputie.</note>
&amp; in the thirt&eacute;enth yeere of hir maiesties reigne, for the placing of sir William Fitzwilliams
to be lord deputie in his place. Which when he had doone, he passed ouer
the seas, and by iourneies came to the court. He was verie honorablie receiued, and
by hir highuesse well commended, there being sundrie noblemen and gentlemen
of the court, which met him before he came to Whitehall, where hir maiestie then
laie, who (as time conuenieut serued) did recounte vnto hir the whole estate in all
things of the realme of Ireland, which hir maiestie liked verie well.</p>
<p>But this sir John Perot president of Mounster continued still in his office, and
there remained for certeine yeares vntill he was reuoked, which was too soone for that
countrie. For neuer man was more fit gouernour for that effrenated and hardnecked
people than was he, nor was that countrie euer in better estate for wealth,
peace and obedience, than he in the time of his gouernement did reduce the same
vnto. Happie was that prouince, and happie were those people, which being eaten
out, consumed and deuoured with caterpillers, he had brought and reformed to a
most happie, peaceable, and quiet estate; and he left it euen in the same maner.
Which if it had b&eacute;ene continued by the like, to haue followed him in the gouernement,
the same would so haue continued: but the want of the one was in short time the
decaie of the other, and that reformed countrie brought to a most miserable estate,
as by the consequence may app&eacute;ere.</p>
<p>Sir William Fitzwiliams, hauing a speciall care and respect to his charge and office,
disposeth all things in the best order he could by the aduise of the councell,
and finding the state somewhat quiet, sauing Mounster, his care and studie was so
to keepe and mainteine it. And he being a wise and a graue man, and of so great
experience in that land, he draweth the plot of his gouernement into certeine speciall
points and articles. First, that the religion established according to Gods holie
<note place="marg">The points of sir William Fitzwilliams lord deputies gouernement.</note>

word, should haue a fr&eacute;e passage through the whole land, and by euerie man
aswell of the clergie as of the laitie to be receiued, imbraced and followed. Then
that the common peace and quietnesse throughout the whole land might and should
be conserued, and all occasions of the breach thereof, and of all mutinies and diuisions
to be cut off. Thirdlie, that hir maiesties great and excessiue charges to
the consuming of hir treasure might be shortened, and hir reuenues well husbanded
and looked vnto, according to hir sundrie commandements tofore giuen. Lastlie,
that the lawes and iustice might haue their due course and be current throughout
the whole land, and the iudges and officers should vprightlie minister iustice to each
man according to his desert, and that all the souldiers should be kept in that discipline
<note place="marg">Souldiers to be kept in their discipline.</note>
as to them apperteineth.</p>
<p>These considerations and such like, being ordered and established with the consent
and aduise of the whole councell, and well liked of euerie good subiect, bicause
the same was grounded vpon verie good reasons: yet it tooke not that effect
as it was meant and wished it should. For that wicked race of the Irishrie, in whom

was no zeale in religion, and lesse obedience to hir maiestie, and least care to liue
in an honest conuersation and common societie, but alwaies watching the best opportunitie
and time to breake out into their woonted outrages, robberies, and rebellions:
these (I saie) in sundrie places begin to plaie their pagents. The first was
Brian Mac Kahir of Knocking in the countie of Caterlough Cauenagh, who vpon
<note place="marg">Brian Mac Kahir his warres in Wexford.</note>
certeine wrongs which he complained he had receiued by one Robert Browne of
Malrenkam, he tyrannized ouer the whole countrie, committed manie outrages and
spoiles, preied the countrie, &amp; burned sundrie towns. Likewise the gentlemen of
the countie of Wexford, and namelie sir Nicholas Deuereux knight, being gr&eacute;eued
with the death of Robert Browne, who was his nephue, being his sisters sonne,
were as vnquiet on their parts, and all rose vp in armour against Brian Mac Kahir,
and each one with all the forces they could make did resist the other, so that all the
whole countrie was thereby in a verie troublesome state; and no end could be had
before they had tried it with the sword. For the Wexford men following their
matters verie egarlie, and being in a great companie well appointed, they sought
out Brian Mac Kahir, and gaue the onset vpon him; but he so watched the matter,
and tooke them at that aduantage, that although he and his companie were but
small in respect of the others, yet he gaue them the foile and ouerthrow, and killed
<note place="marg">Brian Mac Kahir hath the victorie of the Wexford men.</note>

<note place="marg">Thomas Masterson.</note>
the most principall gentlemen of that shire about or aboue thirtie persons.</p>
<p>In this companie was an English gentleman, who after was in great credit &amp; offiee
among them, and he in danger to haue drunken of the same cup, was driuen
to leape vp on horssebacke behind another man, and so escaped, or else he had
neuer b&eacute;ene seneschall of that prouince. After this fight, though the grudge
were not forgotten nor a reuenge vnsought, yet by little and little it quailed. About
two yeares after, Brian Mac Kahir made humble sutes to the lord deputie for his
<note place="marg">Brian Mac Kahir his submission.</note>
pardon, and submitted himselfe to his lordships deuotion, confessing in writing his
fowle disorders and outrages; and yet firmlie auouching that the quarell did not
begin by him nor by his meanes: his submission was such and in so humble sort,
as that he obteined the same. And according to his promise then made, he did
thenseforth vse and behaue himselfe most dutifullie, and liued in a verie good order.
This Brian was a Cauenaugh, and the sonne of Charels, the sonne of Arthur, which
<note place="marg">Brian Mac Kahir what he was.</note>
Arthur was by king Henrie the eight made a baron for terme of his life: for he was
a man of great power within the counties of Wexford &amp; Catherlough. And this
Brian Mac Kahir Mac Arthur was a yoonger sonne to Charels, but the chiefest for
valiantnesse, magnanimitie and wisedome; and none of all the sept of the Cauenaughs,
though they were manie and valiant men, to be compared vnto him euerie

to be a follower vnto sir Peter Carew, with whom he neuer brake his promise, but
stood him in great st&eacute;ed aswell in matters of counsell, as of anie seruice to be doone
in those parts. A man (which is rare among these people) verie constant of his

was altogither in actual rebellion by the earle Clanricard sonnes, and they for their
aid had called &amp; waged a thousand Scots. And though they and the Irishrie were
of diuerse nations, yet of one and of the same dispositions and conditions, being
altogither giuen to all sinne and wickednes, and their harts were altogither imbrued
in bloud and murther. The earle himselfe was at this time prisoner in the castell of

Dublin for the same rebellion, who hearing of the outrages of his sonnes, made sute
to the lord deputie, that if he might be set at libertie, he would vndertake to bring
in his sons, and to quiet the countrie.</p>
<p>The lord deputie, desiring nothing more than peace, after sundrie conferences
had with him, did by the aduise of the councell inlarge him, in an assured hope
that he would effectuallie performe in d&eacute;ed what he had promised in word. But he
came no sooner home among his people, and had conferred with his sonnes, but he
forgat his promise and performed nothing at all. Likewise the Ochonners and the
<note place="marg">The Ochonners and the Omores rebell.</note>
Omores, accompanied with a rable of like rebels, fall into open rebellion, spoile the
countrie, deuoure the people, and make all wast and desolate. Tirlough Lenough
in Vlster was readie to reuolt, but that he stood in doubt of the earle of Essex,
who lieng vpon the fines and marches in Vlster, was not onelie in readinesse to
haue bearded him: but also he had set Odoneile in open warres against him. Mounster
was likewise in open rebellion. But sir Iohn Perot then president so coursed
and followed them, that notwithstanding a great combination and league was betw&eacute;ene
<note place="marg">The distressed mind of the lord deputie.</note>
Iames Fitzmoris and all the rebels in Connagh and Leinster, yet he kept
them asunder and so sharpelie pursued Iames, that he left him no one place to rest
in, nor anie followers to follow him. Besides these vniuersall troubles, which were
sufficient to haue apalled the best and wisest gouernour, these three things increased
his griefe and sorrow. First the losse of a most faithfull councellor and one of his
chiefest and trustiest assistants doctor Weston then lord chancellor, whom it pleased
<note place="marg">The death of doctor Weston lord chancellor.</note>
God to call out of this miserable life, a man in his life time most godlie, vpright and

and perfect, in iustice most vpright and vncorrupted, in hospitalitie verie bountious
and liberall, and in manners and conuersation most courteous and gentle,
faithfull to his prince, firme to his friend, and courteous to all men. And as was
his life so was his death, who a little before the same called his houshold, and gaue
them such godlie instructions, as to their callings apperteined. Then he set his
priuate things in order, and he spent all the time that he had in praiers and exhortations.</p>
<p>At
last, feeling a declination towards, he appointed a generall communion to be
had of his houshold and friends in his chamber, vnto which all the councell came
and were partakers. And then these godlie actions finished, he gaue a most godlie
exhortation to the councell, persuading them to be vertuous and zelous in Gods
true religion: then to be mindfull of their duties to hir maiestie, and lastlie remembring
their callings and estate, and the great charge of the gouernement laid
vpon them and committed vnto them, that they would be valiant, carefull, and
studious to performe the same, as might be to the glorie of God, honor to the
qu&eacute;ene, &amp; benefit to the whole realme. Which points he handled so godlie, learnedlie
&amp; effectuallie, that he made their teares to trill, and their hearts to be heauie.
After this doone he bid them farewell, and not long after he being feruent in his
praiers, he died most godlie, vertuouslie, and christian like.</p>

so troublesome a time, it was doubted verie much what would insue thereof.
Wherefore not onelie in that land, but in England also, hir maiestie vpon knowledge
did cause musters to be made in all the parts vpon and towards the south and
west parties, and men to be in readinesse to be transported, if anie occasion by his
escape should happen to follow. For it was greatlie doubted what would follow of
that his breach, sauing that the president in Mounster was thought to be sufficientlie
prepared and furnished against him, if he did or would attempt anie disorder
that waie.</p>
<p>The third was the reuocation of the earle of Essex, who had taken vpon him to
<note place="marg">The reuocation of the erle of Essex.</note>
recouer the whole prouince of Vlster to obedience, with hir maiesties aid. And he
hauing with great charges brought the same to a great likelihood and towardnesse,
the armie was cashed, and he dismissed and discharged, and the enterprise dissolued.
These with sundrie other accidents of the like nature, were sufficient to haue swallowed
vp anie man in the gulfe of despaire, had not the lord God looked vpon
him, and hir maiestie most gratiouslie pondered his manie &amp; sundrie most humble
requests for his reuocation, which hir highnes by hir letters vnto him granted; and
immediatlie wherevpon he (after foure yeares painfull seruice) was discharged of
<note place="marg">Sir William Fitzwilliams discharged of the deputiship.</note>
his office, &amp; returned into England, Manie good &amp; notable things were doone in
the time of this mans deputation worthie to be remembred, and for euer to be chronicled.
But forsomuch as the records and presidents of the same cannot bee had,
and the imprinter cannot staie his impression anic longer time, the same with patience
must be borne withall, vntill a better opportunitie shall serue as well for it, as
for the commendation of this honorable &amp; ancient gentleman, who hath deserued
well and honourablie of his prince and countrie for his seruice and gouernment.
After that this man was cleane discharged, the sword and office was deliuered vnto

cursed land, and arriued at the Skirries the twelfe of September 1575, who at his
comming found the infection of the plague so generallie dispersed, and especiallie
in the English pale, that he could hardlie find a place where to settle himselfe without
<note place="marg">The pestil&eacute;ce great in the English pale.</note>
dancer of infection. And euen as this plague reigned, so the old rebellious
minds of the northerne Vlsterians brake out. For he was no sooner knowne to be
entred into the land, but for a bien veneu to welcome him into the countrie, Serlo
Boie with his companie came to Knockfergus, there to make preie of the towne,
<note place="marg">Serlo Boie assaulteth Knockfergus.</note>
&amp; so proudlie assailed the same, that he slue a capteine named Baker, and his lieutenant,

and the Scots perforce driuen awaie.</p>
<p>The lord deputie, considering with himselfe that of such beginnings euill would

knowing also by his owne experience, how perillous delaies be in such cases, thought
it verie necessarie' and expedient (according to the old saieng <emph>Principifs obsta ser&ograve;

of so manie of hir maiesties priuie councell, as could in that quesie time be assembled,
he tooke order for the safe k&eacute;eping of the English pale, and committed the
custodie thereof in his absence, to certeine gentlemen of best account and wisedome,
to s&eacute;e the same to be kept and quieted. And he himselfe in his owne person,

<p>Now in all that iorneie few came to submit themselues, sauing Mac Mahon, and
Mac Gwier, &amp; Tirlough Lenough, who first sent his wife; and she being a woman verie
well spoken, of great modestic, nurture, parentage, and disposition, and aunt to
the then earle of Argile, was verie desirous to haue hir husband to liue like a good
subiect, and to be nobilitated. Tirlough himselfe followed verie shortlie after his
wife, &amp; came before the lord deputie without pledge, promise or hostage, and simplie
&amp; without anie condition did submit himselfe in all humblenesse and reuerence
<note place="marg">Tirlough Lenough submitteth him in all humilitie.</note>
to his lordship, making the like sutes as his wife before his comming had motioned
vnto his lordship, referring himselfe neuerthelesse to be ordered and directed by his
lordship in all things. And after that he had spent two daies, vsing himselfe in all
the time of his abode in all dutifulnesse, subiection, and reuerence, did in like maner
take his leaue, and returned to his owne home. And as for Odonell lord of Tirconell,
and Mac Gwier lord of Farmanaugh, albeit they came not in persons, yet
they wrote their most humble letters of submission, and offered all such rents and
seruices, as to them apperteined to y&eacute;eld, making request that they might onelie

<p>After that the lord deputie had performed this iourneie, and was returned to Dublin,

then he made the like iourneies towards the other parts of the land. And beginning
in Leister, he found the whole countie of Kildare, and the baronie of Carberie,
extreamelie impouerished by the Omeries, both in the time of the late rebellion,
and also since, when they were vnder protection. The kings and queenes
counties were all spoiled &amp; wasted by the Oconners and the Omores, the old natiue
inhabiters of the same, and of them Rorie Og had gotten the possession and the
setling of himselfe in sundrie lands there, whether the tenants will or no, and
as a prince occupieth what he listeth, and wasteth what he will. Neuerthelesse,

vpon the word of the earle of Ormond, he came to the lord deputie at his being in

made humble sute vnto his lordship for his presence at the funerals at Waterford,

newes of this knights death, so now also vpon the new ricitall thereof, maruellouslie
lamented and bewailed the losse of so worthie a knight, and the want of so

<p>Sir Peter Carew was descended of noble and high parentage, whose first ancestor
<note place="marg">Sir Peter Carew his life, birth and conditions.</note>

<note place="marg">His descent.</note>
was named Montgomereie and in the time of king Henrie the second he
maried the ladie Elisabeth daughter to Roesius prince of Soathwales, by which mariage
he was aduanced to honour, and made baron of the castell of Carew, whereof
<note place="marg">Baron of Carew.</note>
his posteritie in time tooke their surnames, being called Carews. And some of
them passing into Ireland did grow to be mightie men, and of great honor and
possessions in that land, being marquesses of Corke, barons of Hidron and Lexnew,
lords of Maston, and inheritors to sundrie great lordships and seigniories in
that land. And likewise in England they were men of great credit, seruice, and
honour, and by waie of mariages matched and combined with honourable and great
houses.</p>
<p>This foresaid sir Peter, who was lineallie descended from them, was of stature
<note place="marg">His stature.</note>
meane, but verie stronglie and well compacted; of complexion cholerike, from his
childhood vpwards bent and giuen to an honest disposition, and in his tender yeares
<note place="marg">His disposition.</note>
he serued vnder, and was page to the prince of Orenge beyond the seas, and by
that means had the greater delight &amp; skill in martiall affaires, wherein he had good
<note place="marg">His skill and seruice in the warres</note>
knowledge, as did well appeare in the manifold seruices he did vnder king Henrie
the eight, king Edward the sixt, and qu&eacute;ene Elisabeth, in sundrie places beyond as
also on this side the seas. He was in his yonger years a great traueller, and had
<note place="marg">His trauels.</note>
b&eacute;ene at Constantinople in the Turkes court, at Vienna in the emperours palace, at
Venice, and in the French kings court, and in the houses of the most of all christian
princes; in cuerie of which places he left some tokens of his value. He was blessed
of God with manie singular good gifts, as well of the mind as of the bodie, being
vertuouslie disposed euen from his verie infancie, sincere in religion (and for which
<note place="marg">His religion.</note>
he was partlie an exiled man in the Marian daies) dutifull to his prince, and faithfull
<note place="marg">His qualities.</note>
to his countrie, vpright in iustice, politike in gouernement, and valiant in armes,
skilfull in the Italian and French toongs, and a great student in such bookes as those
<note place="marg">His learning.</note>
toongs did y&eacute;eld; and by that means some knowledge ioined with his pregnancie
of wit, he would discourse verie substantiallie in anie matter concerning policie or
religion, peace or warres, good to euerie man, hurtfull to no man; bountifull &amp;
<note place="marg">His c&omacr;ditions.</note>
liberall, abhorring couetousnesse and whordome: a great housek&eacute;eper, and of
great hospitalitie. And if anie fault were in him, it was rather of too much spending,
than in reasonable sauing; he would be soone warme, but without gall, and
<note place="marg">His anger without malice.</note>
against his enimie most stout and valiant: finallie such was his vpright dealing,
honest conuersation, and zeale to the commonwealth, as no man was more honoured
<note place="marg">His zeale.</note>
nor vniuersallie beloued than was he.</p>
<p>When he had spent the greater part of his age, he bethought himselfe vpon such
<note place="marg">His title to his lands in Ireland.</note>
lands as his ancestors had in Ireland, and which in right did descend vnto him:
and finding his title to be good, he acquainted hir highnesse therewith; and obteined
hir fauour and good will to passe ouer into Ireland, to follow the recouerie
thereof. Which he did, and made such good proofes of his title, as well by records
<note place="marg">He recouereth some part of his lands in Ireland.</note>
as by euidences, that he recouered so much as he did then put in sute, namelie the
lordship of Maston, of which he had b&eacute;ene dispossessed of about seauen score
yeares, which he departed with vnto sir Christopher Chiuers knight, then tenant
to the same, and the baronie of Hidron then in the possession of the Cauenaughs,
the ancient enimies of the English gouernment, and who had expelled his ancestors
about two hundred yeares past. But being put once in possession, he dealt in such
<note place="marg">His good dealing with his tenants.</note>
good order with them, and so honourablie vsed himselfe, that they all voluntarilie
yeelded vp their lands, and submitted themselues to his deuotion; and finding him
to be a verie rare man in manie and sundrie respects, as of the like they had not
heard nor knowne, they much reioised of him, and counted themselues happie and

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"blessed"</fw>-->


<pb n="377"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"377"</fw>-->


blessed to be vnder his gouernment. At his first comming he resumed the whole
baronie into his owne hands, and thereof he gaue some p&eacute;eces in fr&eacute;ehold, to such
gentlemen as he thought good; and for the residue euerie of them what he had
before, he tooke it againe vnder writing by lease. He diuided the baronie into
certeine manors and lordships, and in euerie one he did erect a court baron, and
there all matters in variance betw&eacute;ene them were ended and determined after the
English maner, according to iustice &amp; truth. He would not suffer anie wrong to
be doone vnto them, neither would he beare with anic of them dooing wrong.
Their complaints he would heare, and with indifferencie he would determine them:
he dwelled among them, and kept a verie liberall and a bountifull house, and such
<note place="marg">His housekeeping and hospitalitie.</note>
hospitalitie as had not b&eacute;ene tofore knowne among them; and for which he was
maruellouslie beloued, and his fame spred throughout that land.</p>
<p>He kept continuallie of his owne priuat familie, aboue or n&eacute;ere a hundred persons
in house, he had alwaies in readinesse fortie horssemen well appointed, besides
footmen, &amp; commonlie one hundred Kerns, and all that his countrie at commandement;
by which meanes he chased and pursued such as laie vpon the frontiers of
his countrie, that they if anie had offended, would come and submit themselues
simplie to his mercie: &amp; the residue willing to serue him at all n&eacute;eds. If anie
noble man or others did passe by his house, there he first staied and was interteined
according to his calling, for his cellar doore was neuer shut, &amp; his butterie alwaies
open, to all commers of anie credit. If anie garrison either came to assist and attend
him, or passed through his countrie, he gaue them interteinment, and vittelled
them at his owne charges, and paied readie monie both for it, and for all things
taken of the countrie; for without present paiment he would haue nothing: which
<note place="marg">Readie paiment for all things.</note>
was a rare thing and not heard of in that land. And as concerning hir maiesties
seruice, it was so honourable for hir highnesse, and so profitable to the countrie,
and accomplished with such a disposition and a good will, as all and euerie the gouernours
in his time thought themselues happie to be assisted with such a man. In
matters of counsell he was verie graue and considerate, in matters of policie verie
wise and circumspect, and in martiall affaires verie valiant and noble, and in all of
great knowledge and experience: in euerie of which (as occasion serued) his seruice
was readie and at commandement, so long as his abode was in that land.</p>
<p>In the Butlers warres, vpon commandement from the deputie, he did first serue at
<note place="marg">His seruice in the Irish wars.</note>
Cloghgreman, a castell of sir Edmund Butlers, where being accompanied with capteine
Gilbert, capteine Malbeie, and capteine Basnet, and Henrie Dauels, and their
bands, assaulted the castell, tooke it, and gaue the preie to the souldiers. Then
they went to Kilkennie where they issued out and made a sallie vpon the whole armie
of sir Edmund Butler: which being about thr&eacute;e miles from the towne, gaue them
the ouerthrow, and put all the Gallowglasses and the rest to the sword, sauing the
horssemen and Kernes which fled into the woods: and then m&eacute;eting the lord deputie,
attended him in the whole iourneie and seruice of the said warres vntill the same was
ended. In which he assisted the said deputie with his faithfull aduise and counsell,
and with all such dutifull seruice as which his lordship could not lacke, and which he
so aduertised to hir maiestie. Likewise in Vlster he was in the whole or the most
part of that seruice with the carle of Essex, whom he aduised and assisted with all
<note place="marg">Sir Peter Carewes seruice in Vlster.</note>
the best seruice and counsell he could, to the great comfort of the earle, and commendation
of himselfe.</p>
<p>The fame and report of this noble gentleman, for his wisedome, valiantnesse, experience,
vprightnes, housk&eacute;eping, bountifulnesse, liberalitie, and his iust dealings
with euerie man, was spred through out all that nation, and he fauoured and beloued

he had a iust title to their lands and possessions, and that he (as descending lineallie
from the marquesse of Corke) was their lawfull lord, and to whome they ought to
y&eacute;eld their lands; some of them made their repaire, and some wrote their letters
<note place="marg">The offer of the gentlemen to be his tenants.</note>
vnto him: and all with one consent acknowledged him to be their right and lawfull
lord, and offered not onelie truelie to instruct and to aduertise him throughlie of his
whole inheritance; but if it would please him to come to the citie of Corke, they
would all appeare before him, and submit themselues, and y&eacute;eld vp their lands into
his hands. Sir Peter Carew, when he had considered and well bethought of these
offers, and had taken aduise with his fr&eacute;ends, thought it not good to refuse the same;
and that so much the sooner, bicause he had made hir highnesse acquainted with his
title, and had before obteined hir letters to sir William Fitzwilliams then lord deputie
of Ireland, and to sir Iohn Parret then lord president of Mounster, that they
should assist him in his sutes, and to call the contrarie parts, and to persuade them
with all quietnesse to y&eacute;eld to his iust titles. And againe, finding that part of the
realme to be now verie quiet, &amp; the people well disposed, he sent first his agent the
writer heereof to Corke, where and before whome there came Mac Artie Riogh,
Corman Mac Teege, Barrie Og, the Omalions, the Odriscots, the Odallies, &amp; sundrie
others, who of their owne fr&eacute;ewill offered to giue in recompense of that which was
past, and towards the setting vp of his house, if he would come and dwell among
them, thr&eacute;e thousand kine; and so manie sh&eacute;epe and hogs and corne, as according
to that proportion; and would also y&eacute;erelie giue him in the like maner such a portion
as should be to his contentation and good liking. When his agent had aduertised
these things vnto him, and according to his order had prepared a house in
Kinsale, and one other in Corke for him: the said sir Peter did set the house of
Leighlin to his kinsman and cousine Peter Carew, who afterwards was his heire,
and prepared his ship to passe himselfe with his houshold stuffe to Corke. And
being in readinesse for the same, it pleased God to call him to another passage; for

recognisances staple, not onelie within their owne towne &amp; concerning themselues,

<p>These and manie other like priuileges of the kings of England from time to time,
of their bounteous liberalitie and in consideration of their dutifull and good seruices,
did giue and bestow vpon them. All which, O you the inhabitants of Manapia
and citizens of Waterford, the ofspring of so good ancestors, ought to be
<note place="marg">An admonition to the citizens of Waterford.</note>
lessons and presidents vnto you, for your continuance in the like offices and duties:
that you maie thereby shew your selues to be as were your predecessors, faithfull,
loiall, and obedient: and that your apophthegme maie be for euer found true, <emph>Waterfordia
<note place="marg"><emph>Waterfordia semper vanet intacta.</emph></note>
semper manet intacta.</emph> Otherwise brag neuer so much of your worthinesse,
&amp; glorie neuer so much of your values (as the Iewes did of their father Abraham)
yet it shall so little auaile you, that their honour shall be your reproch, and their
glorie your shame, if you doo not also the like; and in the end your vtter confusion.
For as the holie scripture saith: If you be the children of light, then as
children walke you in the light; otherwise that light which is in you shall be darkenesse.
If you be the children of Abraham, then doo you the workes of Abraham:
otherwise God, who is able and will raise vp the verie stones to be sonnes to
Abraham, shall reiect you, and giue your citie to a people which shall bring foorth
the fruits of dutie and obedience. For so did he with his owne peculiar people, the
Iewes, whom for their disobedience against himselfe, and against his annointed
princes, did after sundrie punishments and no amendment giue them ouer vnto
their enimies hands: who put their yoong men to the sword, &amp; their priests to
slaughter, their virgins were deflowred, their widows defiled, their citie vtterlie destroied,
and not one stone left vpon an other; and all the people which escaped the
sword, carried awaie captiues, &amp; made vagabonds, euen to this daie vpon the face
of the earth. If he did this to his owne peculiar people, doo not you of Waterford,
whom God hath blessed manie waies, thinke that you dooing the like wickednesse,
shall escape the like iudgements. Wherefore if you will eschew the wrath to come,
<note place="marg">An exhortation to the citizens of Waterford.</note>
beware by their examples, and humble your selues in all dutifulnes &amp; obedience to
God and to your prince. Examine not his authoritie, nor decipher his power:
compare not your priuileges with his authoritie, nor doo you dispute your liberties
with his prerogatiue. For notwithstanding your priuileges, liberties, and grants be
great and manie: yet they can not abate nor impugne the least part of the princes
prerogatiue: which is so great, as nothing can be greater, if you will take the view
of Gods owne ordinances, when he first erected and established a king, who gaue
<note place="marg">The princes prerogatiue.</note>
him so high and so absolute authoritie, that (as the apostle saith) it must be with all
humblenesse obeied: bicause he is Gods minister especiallie when it concerneth the
interest of hir maiesties imperiall crowne of that land, the suppression of rebels
and traitors, &amp; the deliuerie of your selues and that realme from the enimies and
rebels.</p>

<p>And doo not you thinke that this digression is impertinent to the historie. For as
your ancestors good dooings are set downe to their praises and commendations; so
the same shall be doone of yours, either to your praises for your well dooings, or for
your reproch to the contrarie. But to the historie. When the lord deputie had
giuen thankes to the maior and his brethren for his good interteinement, he departed
thense by iournies towards Corke, and by the waie at Dungaruon the earle of Desmond
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond humblie offereth his seruice to the lord deputie.</note>

<note place="marg">The lord deputie receiued honorablie into Corke.</note>
came vnto him, and verie humblie offered him all the seruice he was able to
doo to hir maiestie, and did accompanie him from thense vnto the citie of Corke,
where the said lord deputie was receiued in the best manner the citizens could, with
all humblenesse, and with all such triumphs and other shewes and tokens of good
will and dutifulnesse as they could giue, without grudging or complaining either
of the townesmen or of the souldiers. To this towne resorted vnto him the earles of
<note place="marg">All the noblemen in Mounster repaire to the lord deputie.</note>
Desmond, Thomond, Clancar, and all the noblemen and best gentlemen in all
Mounster, and their wiues, and there kept their houses the whole Christmasse.
During his being there, manie complaints were made of great outrages, murthers,
spoiles, and thefts doone throughout that prouince; wherevpon dailie sessions were
kept, and the malefactors of which thr&eacute;e and twentie verie notable and notorious
<note place="marg">Executions at Corke.</note>
offendors were executed and put to death.</p>
<p>It was also ordered, that for the cutting off and abolishing of the great swarmes
and clusters of the idlers, which like waspes troubled the whole land, and liued
onelie by spoile and rapine; that eueric nobleman and gentleman should giue and
<note place="marg">Euerie nobleman and gentleman to answer for his men.</note>
deliuer in the names of euerie seruant and follower which he had, and should s&eacute;e
the same to be booked and registred. And if any of them were found vnbooked
and not registred, that he should be vsed as a fellon where so euer he was taken;
and for all such, as whose names were registred, his lord and master should answer
for him. To this order all the noble and gentlemen gave their full consents, and
foorth with the same was openlie proclamed in their presence, who s&eacute;emed to receiue
it with all ioy, and promised that it should be followed with effect, and immediatlie
they gaue in their pledges. When all things were thus in these parts setled
in good and quiet order, he tooke his iournie towards Limerike, and there he was
receiued with much more pompe and shewes than in anie place before. But as
<note place="marg">The lord deputie honorablie receiued at Limerike.</note>
before, so here he spent a few daies in k&eacute;eping of sessions, in executing of iustice,
and in hearing of poore mens complaints, and tooke the like order for registring
of euerie noble and gentlemans follower, as he had doone at Corke. Which when
he had doone, he rode thense vnto Thomond, where he was complained vnto of
manie great murthers, rapes, thefts, and other outrages, whereof he found great
<note place="marg">Thomond is cleane out of order.</note>
plentie. And for want of sufficient time to proceed throughlie to doo iustice and
iudgement therein; he referred the same to certeine commissioners appointed for
the purpose: sauing that he committed the principall offendors to ward, and some
he banished and abandoned out of those parts, vntill further order were taken for
them.</p>
<p>From thense he entred into Connagh, and came to the towne of Gallewaie,
where he found the towne much decaied and almost desolated, sundrie of the good
<note place="marg">The towne of Gailewaie in great decaie.</note>
housholders hauing sought new habitations vnder Mac William Eughter, and the
countie through out altogither spoiled and deuoured by the Mac an Earles, the
hopeles (but much better if they had beene hoplesse) sonnes of the earle of Clanricard,
whose outrages were most heinous and horrible. But when these graceles
impes perceiued of the great complaints made against them, and doubting what
would be the sequele if some waie were not taken, they voluntarilie went to Gallewaie
<note place="marg">The earle of Clanr cards sonnes submit themselues.</note>
towne, and came to the church vpon a sundaie at the publike seruice, where
the lord deputie then was; and there kneeling vpon their kn&eacute;es confessed their

faults, submitted themselues, and most lamentablie craued pardon, promising vnfeinedlie
amendment, and neuer to reuolt more from their dutifull obedience to
hir maiestie and hir lawes. The deputie mooued herewith, and hoping the best,
did by the aduise of hir maiesties councell thinke it good, with some sharpe reprehensions
and a little punishment for this time to release them, &amp; so he tooke his
iournie towards Dublin, where he came the thirt&eacute;enth of Aprill 1576, but kept sessions
<note place="marg"><date>1576</date></note>
in euerie place as he passed through the countrie, and placed his garrisons in
places conuenient.</p>
<p>In this his iournie he found a verie ruinous state and most lamentable disorders,
which required a sp&eacute;edie reformation. And though the outrages in the ciuill gouernment
were great, yet nothing to be compared to the ecclesiasticall state, for
<note place="marg">The ruine of the ecclesiastical state.</note>
that was too too far out of order; the temples all ruined, the parish churches for the
most part without curates and pastors, no seruice said, no God honored, nor Christ
preached, nor sacraments ministred. And therefore it app&eacute;ered, yea and it was
openlie preached before the lord deputie himselfe, that manie were borne which
<note place="marg">Manie in Ireland not christened.</note>
neuer were christened" and the patrimonie of the church wasted &amp; the lands imbezelled.
A lamentable case, for a more deformed and a more ouerthrowne church
<note place="marg">The spoile of the churches.</note>
there could not be among christians. The deputie considering and bethinking with
himselfe, how the church of God was abused, and that God had in store some
wrath and indignation for this defiling of his holie sanctuary, did for the auoiding
thereof write his letters of aduertisement to hir highnesse, and most earnestlie praied
hir princelie authoritie for redresse thereof; and therewith most humblie requested,
that the commonwealth being destitute of a chancellor, and other most necessarie
magistrates for the gouernement, might likewise with all sp&eacute;ed be sent ouer. When
hir maiestie and councell had considered this aduertisement, and had entered into
the depth thereof, order for a redresse was taken foorthwith: and the matters concerning
<note place="marg">An order for the reformation of religion.</note>
religion and reformation of the church, it was committed to the said lord
deputie, and to archbishops and certeine bishops, with others, to s&eacute;e the same to be
put in execution. And for the gouernment one William Gerard esquier a professor
<note place="marg">William Gerard to be lord chancellor.</note>

<note place="marg">Sir William Drurie to be lord president.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1576</date></note>
of the laws was sent to be lord chancellor, &amp; sir William Drurie to be president
of Mounster, which arriued at Dublin, the one the sixteenth of Iune, and the other
the three and twentith of the same 1576. The lord chancellor he did foorthwith
settle and place in his roome. And then his lordship prepareth to take a iournie
towards Waterford, to doo the like with sir William Drurie. But when he was
passed a daies iournie, word was brought vnto him from the bishop of Meth, who
laie then vpon the confines of Meth and Connagh for ordering of matters in these
<note place="marg">The earle of Clanricards sonnes brake out into rebellion.</note>
parties; and the like from the maior of Gallewaie, and from diuerse others, who
affected well the state, crieng out with trembling termes and dolefull reports, that
the earle of Clanricard his sonnes that basterlie brood, which not scarse two
moneths past had humbled themselues to the lord deputie, confessed their faults,
and craued pardon, and had most firmelie protested and sworne most dutifull and
continuall obedience.</p>
<p>These (I saie) not without the counsell and consent of their father, were on a
<note place="marg">The earle consented to his sonnes disloialtie.</note>
night stollen ouer the riuer of Shennon, and there cast awaie their English apparell,
and clothed themselues in their old woonted Irish rags, and sent to all their old
friends to come awaie to them, and to bring the Scots whom they had solicited, and
their Gallowglasses, and all other their forces with them. Who when they met
togither, they foorthwith went to the towne of Athenrie, and those few houses
<note place="marg">Athenrie spoiled.</note>
which were newlie builded, they sacked, set the new gates on fire, beat awaie the
masons and labourers which were there in working, brake and spoiled the qu&eacute;enes
armes, and others, there made and cut to be set vp. Bad and wicked they were be

fore, but now ten times worse than euer they were; being come, euen as it is said in the
scriptures, that the wicked spirit was gone out of the man, and wanting his woonted
diet, returneth vnto the house from whense he came, and finding the same swept
cleane, he goeth and s&eacute;eketh out other seuen wicked spirits, and entreth and dwelleth
where he did before, and the last state of that man is woorse than the first.
And if a man should aske of these bastardlie boies, and of their sier, what should be
the cause that they should thus rage, and so wickedlie and suddenlie reuolue, as
dogs to their vomits, so they to their treasons and treacheries, hauing beene so
courteouslie vsed, so gentlie interteined, so friendlie countenanced, so fatherly exhorted,
so pithilie persuaded, &amp; so mercifullie pardoned in hope of amendment:
surelie nothing can they answer, but that they would not be honest, nor in anie part
<note place="marg">Selfewill cause of the rebellion.</note>
satisfie a little of infinite the robberies, thefts, and spoiles which they had made.
For bastardlie slips cannot bring foorth better fruits, neither can thornes bring foorth
grapes. It is the good tr&eacute;e onelie that bringeth foorth good fruits, &amp; which is to be
cherished, and to be much made of; but thornes and briers are prepared for the fire,
and to be burned. For let the husbandman bestow neuer so much husbandrie vpon
the thorne, he will still be but a thorne: yea let him graffe neuer so good a peare
vpon him, the same shall be but a stonie peare; and lacking continuall husbandrie,
will reuolt to his old nature againe. As the husbandman then prospereth best,
when his fields and gardens are weeded and clensed from thornes, brambles &amp; briers,
prepared for the fire: euen so shall the magistrate inioie the quiet state of a commonwealth,
when iustice taketh place, and iudgement is executed; when the good are
<note place="marg">Punishment of the wicked maketh a quiet common wealth.</note>
preserued and cherished, and the wicked (prepared for the gallowes) according to
their deserts are punished.</p>
<p>The instrument, when euerie string is streined to his proper tune, then the musike
is sweet, and the harmonie pleasant; but if that one string be out of order, the discord
of that one marreth and disgraceth all the whole musike of the rest: euen so is
it in a commonwealth, when euerie subiect is dutifull to his prince, obedient to his
magistrate, and liueth according to his vocation and calling, the same prospereth
and flourisbeth; but let the wicked be left at libertie, and be vnpunished, the whole
state is disturbed, &amp; the commonwealth (as a garden ouergrowne with w&eacute;eds) in
perill and danger to be ouerthrowne. The best commonwealth in all ages then
prospered best, when the wicked were as well punished, as the good conserued.
And experience teacheth, that a th&eacute;efe, murtherer, a traitor, &amp; such malefactors doo
neuer better seruice to their prince &amp; commonwealth, than when they be hanged on
the gallowes, and so fastened to a gibbet. But to the matter.</p>
<p>The lord deputie vpon these aduertisements, finding the matter to be of such importance,
<note place="marg">The lord deputie altereth his course, and entreth into Connagh.</note>
which required some expedition to withstand the same, or else the whole
land like to be in danger, altereth his intended iourneie, and returneth to Dublin,
vsing such expedition, that within three daies following he was entered into Connagh.
The brute thereof when it was blowne abrode, it was scarse credited by the rebels,
bicause it was so sudden and with such sp&eacute;ed. But finding it to be true, and they affraid
of their shadowes, they all one and other fled into the mounteins, sauing certeine gentle
men of the earls countrie, which left the traitorous boies, &amp; came to the deputie,
and offered their loialtie and seruice with fidelitie. The earle their father would
faine haue excused himselfe, but in the end when no excuses could be accepted,
<note place="marg">The earle of Clanricard is sent to the castell of Dublin and kept in close prison.</note>
his castels were taken, and he brought to the lord deputie: who notwithstanding
his humble submissions and crauing of pardons, he was sent to the castell
of Dublin, and there kept in close prison. But the lord deputie he passed thense to
Gallewaie, and after he had there staied a few daies, for the comforting of the
townesmen, who stood much dismaied of their estate, and in feare to be surprised

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"and"</fw>-->

and taken for pledges: he passed through Thomond, and came to Limerike, where
<note place="marg">Sir William Drurie placed to be lord president in Mounster.</note>
he setled sir William Drurie (who had accompanied him in all this seruice) to be the
lord president. And from thense being accompanied and attended vpon with him
and the nobilitie of that prouince, and diuerse gentlemen of account, they passed to
Corke, &amp; there the lord president remained.</p>
<p>Now he the said president, being thus placed in the gouernement of that prouince,
<note place="marg">The gouernement of sir William Drurie.</note>
did beare himselfe so vprightlie, and in so honourable a sort, that he reformed the
same maruellouslie both in life and maners: and of a fierce people he tamed them to
obedience. For the euill men he spared not, but by law and iustice in the open sessions,
or by sword without respect of persons he punished according to their deserts:
euen as of the contrarie the good subiects he would fauour and protect. If anie
seruice were to be doone vpon the enimie and rebell, he would be the first in the
field, and neuer ceasse to pursue him, vntill he had either taken him, or driuen him
out of the countrie. If anie matters were in variance betw&eacute;ene man and man, or
anie bils of complaints exhibited vnto him, the same he would either determine, or
referre them to the law, for which he kept courts continuallie, &amp; where the same
were heard and ended, and at which for the most part he would be present. The
rude people he framed to a ciuilitie, &amp; their maners he reformed and brought to
the English order. And by all these means he did maruellouslie reforme that whole
prouince to a most peaceable, quiet and ciuill estate, sauing the countie palatine in
Kerie: which the earle of Desmond claimed to be his libertie, and that no person
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond will haue no officer to intermeddle in his countie palantine.</note>

<note place="marg">The countie palantine a sanctuarie of sinne and wickednesse.</note>

<note place="marg">The lord president purposeth to doo iustice in Kerrie.</note>
was to intermeddle nor yet to vse anie iurisdiction there, other than his owne officers.
But when his lordship had looked into the most loose and dissolute life there
vsed, and that it was a sanctuarie for all lewd and wicked persons, and how that
liberties granted at the first for the maintenance of iustice was now become a cloke
and a shrowd for all licentiousnesse: he purposed and was fullie determined to make
a iourneie into that priuileged place, to make a passage for law and iustice to be there
exercised, euen as he had tofore doone in other places, knowing that it could not be
safe among a great flocke to leaue a scabbed sheepe, nor good for a commonwealth
to haue nursseries for sinne.</p>
<p>The erle, when he perceiued this, he was in a great furie and agonie, and vsed all
the waies he could to dissuade the lord president from the same. Which when he
by no means could compasse, then according to his accustomable dissimulations he
maketh faire weather, and offereth all the seruice he could doo to his lordship, and
requested him that it would please him to vse his house and countrie at his pleasure,
and that it would likewise please his lordship to lie at his house at Tralie when he
passed that waie; the earle minding nothing lesse than his welcome thither, but
practising in the end openlie what he had dissemblinglie and in secret deuised and determined.
The lord deputie, nothing mistrusting anie secret practise to be imagined
against him, granteth the earles request; and when he saw time, he taketh his
iourneie into Kerrie, hauing no more men with him than sufficient, to the number of
<note place="marg">The lord president entreth into Kerrie.</note>
six score, or seuen score persons: and as he passed through the countrie, he kept
courts and sessions, and heard euerie mans complaint: and at length as his iourneie
laie, he rode vnto Tralie, where he minded to lodge with the earle. The earle
hauing the gouernor (as he thought) within his clooches, and minding to practise
that openlie, which he had deuised secretlie; had appointed in a readinesse seuen
hundred, or eight hundred of his best followers to haue intrapped his lordship; and
<note place="marg">The treacherous practise of the earle to haue intrapped the lord president.</note>
in sted of a bien venu into the countrie, to haue cut him off for euer comming more
there. Which his villanous treacherie when his lordship saw and vnderstood; and
considering that he was so n&eacute;ere vpon them, as that he was either to aduenture
vpon them, or with dishonor to hazard himselfe and his companie: he calleth all his

companie togither, and with verie good and pithie words incourageth them to giue
the onset vpon them: and foorthwith with a good courage they all march forwards,
and gaue the charge vpon them. But they, notwithstanding they were all well
armed, and seuen to one of the other: yet being as it were astonied at the boldnesse
of this noble man, and at his great courage; for which he was famous in &amp; through
all that land: both the earle and his companie turned their heeles, forsooke the field,
and dispersed themselues into the woods, and elsewhere, for their best safetie.</p>
<p>The countesse, when she heard hereof, fell in a great sorow and heauinesse for hir
husbands so bad dealings; and like a good Abigaell went and met the lord president,
fell vpon hir kn&eacute;es, held vp hir hands, and with trilling teares praied his
lordships patience and pardon, excusing as well as she could hir husbands follie,
saieng that he had assembled all that companie onelie for a generall hunting,
nothing thinking vpon his lordship; and that the men s&eacute;eing his lordship could not
be persuaded to make anie staie: and so praied his lordship to take it. And herein
she so wiselie and in such modestie did behaue hir selfe, that his lordship granted
hir request, and temporised with the earle. But he followed his determination, and
vsed his authoritie to decide matters in and throughout the palantine of Kerrie.
This gr&eacute;eued the earle to the hart, who hauing no other waie to be reuenged, he deuiseth
<note place="marg">The earle complaineth against the lord president.</note>
certeine articles against the president, which he with great exclames exhibited
vnto the lord deputie. The lord deputie, when he departed from Corke, he returned
to Dublin, where he was aduertised that the Mac an Earles in Connagh had
<note place="marg">The Mac an Earles in Connagh rise in rebellion.</note>
hired a new supplie of two thousand Scots, and were in actuall rebellion. Wherevpon
he prepared a new iourneie thitherwards: and being come thither, he found the
matter to be true, and that they were vp in campe and in outragious maner spoiling
the countries. But before his comming they had besieged Bailie Riogh which was
<note place="marg">The earls sons doo besiege Bailie Rioghe.</note>
the earles their fathers house, and for his treacherous dealings confiscated.</p>
<p>In this house the lord deputie, at his last departure from thense, had placed
Thomas le Strange, and capteine Colier with one hundred footmen, and fiftie
horssemen to lie in garrison; but the earls sons, thinking themselues of sufficient
strength to recouer the same againe, laid siege vnto it, and inuironed it round
about: but they were so resisted, that they did not onelie not preuaile; but the
garrison within did make sundrie assaults vpon them, and slue at sundrie times six
of their principall capteins, and one hundred and fiftie of their men. And in the
end, when they saw they could not preuaile, they raised their siege, and followed
their accustomed robbing and spoiling of the countrie; but especiallie vpon Mac
<note place="marg">Maister William Eughter his countrie spoiled.</note>
William Eughter, from whome they tooke sundrie of his castels, and spoiled him of
his goods and cattels. The lord deputie, not slacking nor shewing his businesse,
<note place="marg">The lord deputie followeth the rebels.</note>
followed out of hand the foresaid rebels, who skipped to and fro in such sort, that
in no case could he find them at any aduantage. Wherfore he did disperse his
companies, and according as intelligence was giuen, he caused pursute to be made
vpon them. And by that meanes, although he could not m&eacute;ete with the whole
troope of them, whereby to haue a full aduantage vpon them; yet manie times he
met with some of them, slue them, hauged and executed them, tooke their preies
from them, and gained awaie their holds and castels. And at length hauing good
espials, it was aduertised vnto him, that the Scots were incamped in the confins and
<note place="marg">The Scots incamped in Connagh.</note>
marches of Mac William Eughters countrie: and therevpon he forthwith marched
thitherwards, and in his waie manie of them fell into his lap, who had their
rewards. Vnto whose lordship resorted the said Mac William with all the force

himselfe most loiall, and did the best seruice that was doone vpon the rebels: and
by the meanes of the said deputie, he recouered, and was repossessed of sundrie
his castels, which in this rebellion had b&eacute;ene taken from him.</p>
<p>The Scots, when they heard of the approching of the deputie towards them, they
<note place="marg">The Scots forsake Connagh and returne home.</note>
raised their campe, and suddenlie dispersed themselues, and the most of them, being
werie of their abode and interteinment, fled into the rout in Vlster. The residue
like vnto the bare arssed rebels sculked to and fro; but in the end, they and the
others were all dispersed, &amp; durst not to appeare. Wherefore the deputie, when he
had broken the galles of them, &amp; had thus dispersed them, he by iournies returned
towards Dublin, and hauing a little before receiued hir maiesties letters in the behalfe
of Nicholas Malbie hir seruant, whome she commended for his sufficiencie, both
<note place="marg">Sir Nicholas Malbie appointed gouernor of Connagh.</note>
for martiall and ciuill causes: and as well for the incouragement of him, as for the
nourishing of the like vertues in others of his profession; hir pleasure was to commit
vnto him the ch&eacute;efe charge and gouernement vnder the said deputie in Connagh,
and willed that he should be forthwith established in that office, &amp; to be sworne one
of hir priuie councell, &amp; to haue that countenance, authoritie, &amp; interteinement
as was m&eacute;et, conuenient &amp; agr&eacute;eable for the place, office, &amp; person. Which the said
deputie most willinglie &amp; gladlie performed, dubbed him knight, and made him gouernor
by the name of a coronell of Connaugh: thinking himselfe most happie, that
he was assisted with such a man, as who for his experience in iudgement, his discretion
in gouernement, and his painefulnesse and skill in martial seruice was sufficient
and compleat; and best able, partlie by force, partlie by persuasion, and
chieflie by ministring of iustice, was (I saie) best able, and would frame the rude
and barbarous people of that prouince to ciuilitie and good order. And thus much
he aduertised vnto hir maiestie by his letters, with thankes for hir choise of so m&eacute;ete
and apt a man. During the time of this seruice and being of the lord deputie in
Connagh, the earle of Essex, a man of great nobilitie and parentage died in Dublin.
<note place="marg">The death of the earle of Essex.</note>
Great doubts were made of his death; some thinking that he should be poisoned,
because he was then in the best time of his age, of a verie good constitution of bodie,
and not knowne to haue beene sicke anie time before his death. But the matter
examined by all the meanes that could be deuised, there was no such thing then
found: but supposed, that for so much as he had a flux, which was a spise of a <emph>Dysenteria,</emph>
and wherewith he had beene oftentimes before troubled, by the inspection
<note place="marg"><emph>Dysenteria.</emph></note>
and iudgement of such physicians &amp; others who were present, it was iudged and
found that it was some cause of his death. Some thought rather that he should be

that from all christianitie, all wise and godlie doo know, and euerie good christian
should vnderstand. It is against the word of the Lord and all christian religion;
and therefore not to be credited. It was thought and so affirmed by the most part
of all men, that some inward griefe of the mind and secret sorrow of the hart had
<note place="marg">Sorrow and griefe of mind.</note>
hastened that, which no infirmitie of the bodie nor anie other deuises extraordinarie

possession, and which by no physicke can be releeued or cured: it is but in vaine to
minister the same to the bodie, which can not indure when the other faileth, no more
than can an accident remaine, when the substance is gone; or else as the imbers or
ashes giue heat, when the wood is burned and consumed.</p>
<p>He was no more honorable of birth and parentage by his ancestors, of whome
some descended out of kings loines; but as singular a man for all the gifts both of
mind and bodie, as that age had not manie better. Towards God he was most deuout

<p>In matters of policie he was verie prudent, and of a great reach: in causes of counsell
sound, and of a d&eacute;epe iudgement: in martiall affaires most valiant and of great
courage, and of so heroicall a mind, that if his abilitie had answered his good will, he
had not bin a second, neither to Lacie, nor to Courcie, nor to anie the first conquerors

The more noble were his good and worthie attempts, the more he was
crossed and contraried: but by such secret meanes, as which he did rather for the

and ouerthwarted, he whome no trauels, no paines, no seruice, no hardnesse could

<note place="marg">The earle verle well learned.</note>
sometimes a scholer in the vniuersitie, and had verie good knowledge in all kind of

good order what he had conceiued; and so well he would discourse and argue anie

Lachesis had bene idle, or had spun a longer thread, that he might haue liued to
haue b&eacute;ene imploied according to his excellent vertues, either in matters of counsell,
of policie, or martiall, no doubt he would haue prooued a most worthie and beneficiall

pleasure. And by that meanes he had continuallie about him diuerse men of all degrees,
as well of the clergie, as of the laitie, both men and women, gentlemen &amp;

complaining much, and proouing nothing, and aggrauating the taking of the cesse,
with most manifest vntruths. And so far he was carried in misliking the gouernment,
bicause he saw his owne woonted swaie was much abated, that he would verie
faine haue slipped out if he could. And it was verelie thought that he was combined
in a secret conspiration with the forelorne sonnes of the earle of Clanricard,

to put awaie his owne wife, &amp; to haue matched himselfe in marriage with Shanes
sister, who was Orwackes wife, &amp; of late forsaken by him. Neuerthelesse, the erle

quiet, and came in to the said president, and deliuered in his men that were demanded,
&amp; which before he denied, being verie notorious malefactors and practisers
of vnquietnesse.</p>
<p>And now that the whole land was (as was thought) in quiet, or at least in outward
shew more quiet than in times past, the noblemen &amp; gentlemen in the English
pale, of whome least suspicion of anie euill was thought, they begin verie inconsideratlie
<note place="marg">The gentlemen in the pale begin to repine against the cesse.</note>
to repine against the cesse: who if they had entred into the due consideration
thereof, they (although somewhat to their further charge) should haue
mainteined it: because that the same was procured for the defense of themselues, and
they onelie had the benefit thereof. For you shall vnderstand that the lord deputie,
being a man of great wisdome, knowlege, and experience, when he considered the
fickle state of that wauering and rebellious nation of the Irishrie, who notwithstanding
they had neuer so firmly promised, sworne, and vowed all allegiance and obedience
to hir maiestie: yet vpon euerie light occasion, without anie respect of faith
and dutie, would fling out into secret conspiracies, and so into open rebellion; and
then for the appeasing thereof, and the preseruation of hir good subiects, hir highnesse
was driuen to inlarge hir garrisons, and to increase hir armie to hir excessiue
charges, and all which companies were vittelled by the English pale: and further,
considering that the benefit which grew hereby, was generallie extended to the whole
pale, who in equitie should be contributorie to the burthen, as they were partakers of
the ease, and yet manie of them, pretending to haue liberties and priuileges, claimed
<note place="marg">Liberties claimed to be discharged of the cesse.</note>
to be exempted from anie contribution at all, whereby the residue were the more
gr&eacute;eued, &amp; the greater burthened, to their impouerishing, &amp; the hinderance of their
seruice: the lord deputie caused a through search to be made in hir highnesse court
<note place="marg">The records searched for liberties.</note>
of the excheker in Ireland, of all the records, for and concerning all and all manner
of liberties which at anie time had tofore bin granted to anie person or persons whatsoeuer:
and in the end found that (verie few ancient liberties excepted) all were vsurped,
or by statute repealed.</p>
<p>Wherevpon to ease the oppressed, and to make the burthen to be borne more
vniuersallie, and so more indifferentlie; and for the better furtherance of hir highnesse
seruice: he commanded by proclamation all such liberties and fr&eacute;edoms to be
<note place="marg">Liberties dissolued by proclamation.</note>
dissolued, as which either had no grant at all, or which had not that continuance of
times out of memorie of man. And of this latter sort were manie made by a statute
but to indure onelie for ten yeares, and all which were expired. And for this cause
they neuer found fault before now that they are greeued, and therefore doo repine
against cesse; and with open mouths crie out, that they were so poore that they
could not beare anie cesse, and that it was against the law. And here for your better
vnderstanding what cesse is, and what is meant thereby; it is a prerogatiue of
<note place="marg">What cesse is.</note>
the prince, to impose vpon the countrie a certeine proportion of all kind of vittels
for men and horsse, to be deliuered at a reasonable price called the qu&eacute;ens price, to
all and euerie such souldiors as she is contented to be at charge withall, and so much
as is thought competent for the lord deputies house; and which price is to be yeerelie
rated and assessed by the lord deputie and the councell, with the assistants and
assent of the nobilitie of the countrie, at such rates and prices as the souldiors may
liue of his wages, and the said deputie of his interteinment.</p>
<p>These things although they were orderlie doone, yet certeine malecontents, finding
<note place="marg">The malecotents make their supplication to the lord deputie &amp; councell to be discharged of the cesse.</note>
themselues gr&eacute;eued, bicause they should also now beare a portion, and be contributaries:
first they draw their heads togither, and make there supplication to the lord
deputie and councell, which was receiued verie willinglie, and offer made that conference
should be had with them, how and what waie it might best be deuised to ease
there griefes, &amp; not to charge the qu&eacute;ene. Whervpon at a time appointed they all

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"met,"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"390"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>-->


met, and came in persons before the deputie and councell, where the said malecontents
first opened their griefes, that they had certeine old and ancient priuileges and
liberties which were taken from them; then that they were compelled to yeeld to an
vnreasonable cesse, which they were not able to beare, and that was will and pleasure
onlie, and contrarie to all law and reason, that anie such charge should be imposed
vpon them without a parlement or grand councell.</p>
<p>When the lord deputie and councell heard them at full, they appointed a daie,
when they should come and receiue their answer. In the meane time the lord deputie
and councell consulted and considered of the matter, and resolued themselues
vpon an answer. And when the daie came and they appeered, answer was made
vnto them by the mouth of the lord chancellor, that they had no charters nor liberties
at all to be found in hir highnesse records, other than such as were expired and
of no validitie. And as for the greatnesse of the cesse, the burden whereof they had
alleged to be vnreasonable and not to be horne, bicause they said &amp; auouched that
it was ten pounds &amp; twelue pounds of ech plough land; it was offered that they
should be discharged, if they would paie but fiue markes for euerie plough land.
And whatsoeuer they said in deniall of the paieng of the cesse, it was and is to be
proued, that it was not onelie hir maiesties prerogatiue which may not be impeached;
but also to be prooued by most ancient records, that euer since the time of king
Henrie the fourth, for the space of eight or nine score yeares, there hath bin still from
time to time, as occasion hath required, the like charges imposed by the name of
cesse by the deputie and councell, and such nobilitie as were sent for and did come to
the same, now in question and by them repined at. Neuerthelesse, they repined and
flatlie denied that they would y&eacute;eld to anie cesse, saieng and alledging as before, that
it was against reason and law, and therefore praied that they might haue his lordships
libertie to make their repaire ouer into England, and to acquaint hir highnesse with
their case. Wherevnto he answered, that he would neither giue any such leaue nor
denie them to go. Wherevpon they assembled themselues togither againe, and by the
aduise of certeine busie headed lawiers and malecontented gentlemen, who had stirred
and set them a worke to conioine themselues to follow this sute, and contributed
a masse of monie amongst themselues, for the charge of the said lawiers, namelie
Barnabie Scurlocke, Richard Neteruill, and Henrie Burnell, who hauing b&eacute;ene sometimes
students in the ins of the court in London, &amp; acquainted with Littletons tenures,
thought themselues so well fraughted with knowledge in the laws, as they
were able to wade in all matters of the deepest points of the law. But if they had
first (as it becommeth dutifull subiects) to haue looked in the booke of God, they
<note place="marg">The prerogatiue of a prince by the law of God.</note>
should haue found it written there, that it was God himselfe who first made kings
and established their thrones, and gaue them most excellent preeminences next to
himselfe, that they should be vnder him the supreme gouernours vpon the earth;
and haue that authoritie and prerogatiue, that all inferiors and subiects should and
ought in all humblenesse and dutifulnesse submit themselues vnto the obedience of
them for the Lords sake; bicause so is it the will of God, without sifting of his authoritie
or examining his gouernment. For there is no power (as the apostle saith)
but of God, &amp; they are ordeined of God; wherfore who so resisteth them, resisteth
God, and whose resistances &amp; disobediences the Lord himselfe bath reuenged oftentimes
on the disobedient. Wherfore euerie man is to be subiect in all humilitie &amp;
obedience vnto them in all maner of ordinances, being not against God, not onlie
bicause of wrath, but also for conscience sake, especiallie in matters being well considered,
&amp; which doo concerne their one benefit and safetie. If this be the infallible
truth, how farre were these men ouershot, that thus would dispute the princes
prerogatiue with their Littletons tenures; and measure the same with their owne

rules and deuises? It had bin much better for them, &amp; more to their commendations,
if they had (as the scholers of Pythagoras) kept silence and had held their
peace, vntill such time as they had beene better studied in their owne lawes: and
then they should haue found it written that the prince or king is the head and most
<note place="marg">The kings pyerogatiue by the lawes of the realme.</note>
excellent part of the bodie of the commonwealth; and through his gouernance the
preseruer and defender of the whole bodie, and (as the prophet termeth them) to be
nourishing fathers of the people which are the rest of the bodie, and for which causes
the lawes doo attribute vnto him all honor, diguitie, prerogatiue, and preeminence
aboue all others; and which his prerogatiue dooth not onelie extend to his owne person,
and all that which he hath of his owne, but also to all his subiects. And the
lawyers themselues doo so far stretch this for a <emph>Marime,</emph> that whatsoeuer lawes be
made and established either for the benefit of holie church or common profit, it is
alwaies implied <emph>Salua in omnibus regis pr&aelig;rogatiua;</emph> and that nothing shall be intended
to be preiudiciall to his crowne and dignitie. But by all likelihood these men
were not so farre read; or if they had, their malice or desire of some pelting lucre,
which blindeth manie of that profession, had made them forgetfull of themselues &amp;
of their duties. Well, these great lawiers beare the malecontented lords &amp; gentlemen
in hand, that their cause &amp; sute was good and reasonable, and by the law to be
warranted, &amp; not to be doubted but the same would haue good successe. Whervpon
they made vp their supplication and letters to hir maiestie, with the like letters
<note place="marg">The impaled gentlemen send into England their agents to complaine.</note>
to hir honorable priuie councell, dated the tenth of Ianuarie, 1576, and vnder the
hands of Rowland vicount of Baltinglas, Ed. of Deluin, Christopher of Hoth, Peter
of Trimleston, Iames of Kellew, and Patrike Naugle barons; sir Oliver Plunket, sir
Thomas Nugeat, sir Christopher Chiuers, and sir William Searefield knights; Edward
Plunket, Patrike Naugle, Patrike Husseie, George Plunket, Francis Nugeat,
Laurence Nugeat, Nicholas Tasse, Iames Nugeat, and William Talbot, in the
names of all the inhabitants within the English pale, had subscribed. And then
also they deliuered in the like order their letters of atturneie vnto their said agents,
and so much monie for their expenses as was thought sufficient, with their order and
promise to supplie what soeuer they should need. And thus being furnished with
all things to their contentments, they past ouer the seas, and made their repaire
vnto the court of England, and there at time conuenient did exhibit their supplications
and letters to hir maiestie and the lords of the councell, which in effect consisted
in these points.</p>

the English pale for hir maiesties garrisons, they finding themselues grieued therewith,
made their complaint thereof vnto the said lord deputie and councell for redresse,
and could not be heard.</p>
<p>Secondarilie, they affirmed that the said cesse, or anie other like to be imposed
<note place="marg">2</note>
vpon them, was against the lawes, statutes, and vsages of that realme.</p>
<p>Thirdlie, that the cesse was a most intollerable and grieuous burden, there being
<note place="marg">3</note>
exacted out of euerie plough land ten and twelue pounds.</p>
<p>Fourthlie, that in the leuieng and exacting, there were manie and sundrie abuses

doone and committed.</p>
<p>When hir maiestie had throughlie read both the complaints and letters, she foorthwith

sent and set them ouer to the lords of hir priuie councell to be considered, and
the same to be throughlie examined; who foothwith assembled themselues, and
hauing read and heard the contents thereof, did compare them with the like letters
sent vnto them from the said malecontented lords &amp; gentlemen; as also with the instructions
and aduertisements, which they likewise had receiued from the lord deputie
and councell out of Ireland, concerning the same. And after long debating

therof, did by hir highnesse commandement call before them the earles of Kildare
and Ormond, the vicount of Gormanstone, and the baron of Dunsanie, who then
were attendant at the court, and declared vnto them the whole matter, and the
maner of these mens proc&eacute;edings both h&eacute;ere and in that realme, whose intent and
meaning was in verie d&eacute;ed, vnder color to s&eacute;eke some reliefe, to haue taken awaie
wholie the imposing of anie cesse, and so consequentlie to haue taken awaie the
right &amp; prerogatiue, which hir maiestie &amp; predecessors haue alwaies inioied, and
without which that realme could not be defended, nor themselues preserued.</p>
<p>These foure noblemen, when they had heard the whole matter, s&eacute;emed to be sorie,
and to mislike of their vnaduised proc&eacute;edings: they confessing and acknowledging
that cesse hath beene alwaies vsed to be taken, and they thought him not to be a
dutifull subiect, who would denie or impugne the same: although they wished and
did praie, that the poore inhabitants in times of scarsitie might be eased of some
part of the burthen which they now presentlie did beare. When the lords of the
<note place="marg">The answers of the councell to the articles of the complainers.</note>
councell had proceeded herein so farre as they could, they deliuered vp their
opinions to hir maiestie, aduertising that concerning the first article they could say
nothing; but that they supposed that the dooings of hir highnesse deputie was not
so strict as was complained: bicause he had written otherwise.</p>
<p>To the second their opinion was, that it touched hir maiesties prerogatiue, so
much to be denied of that imposition, which hath b&eacute;ene vsed, allowed, and continued
for manie yeares, and in times of hir sundrie predecessors; that now it
might not be suffered to be impeached, vnlesse hir highnesse would loose and forgo
hir title, right, and interest to the crowne of Ireland, or else support the whole
burthen and charge to defend the same of hir owne pursse: neither which extreamities
could or might in anie wise be tollerated.</p>
<p>To the third, that the cesse was intollerable, and not able to be borne, they
thought that to be true, if ten pounds and twelue pounds should be demanded out
of euerie plough land, as they complained: but they vnderstood by credible informations
from the deputie and councell the contrarie, &amp; that they were offered
at fiue marks the plough land: which was supposed to be verie easie and reasonable.</p>
<p>To the fourth article their opinion was, that if anie such abuses were doone, it
were good the same were set downe and knowne, and a redresse thereof to be
ordered.</p>
<p>When hir highnesse had read and thoroughlie considered their opinions and resolutions,
<note place="marg">Hir maiestie offended with the complainers.</note>
and finding hir selfe vndutifullie to be handled by hir subiects, commanded by
the aduise of hir councell the said agents which followed their sute, to be committed
to the Fleet, and foorthwith wrote hir letters to the said hir deputie and councell,
<note place="marg">Theagents of the complainers sent to the Fleet.</note>
finding hir selfe grieued with the said hir subiects of the pale, that the rel&eacute;euing of
hir armie with vittels by waie of cesse, should be auouched to be a matter against
law, and ancient custome: and yet the same both in hir time and in the times of hir
progenitors, hath vsuallie b&eacute;ene imposed, and now impugned by some such as in
times past had subscribed therevnto, in preiudice of hir prerogatine, and hinderance
of hir seruice. And therfore she did not onelie mislike, &amp; was greatlie offended
<note place="marg">Hir maiestie offended with the lord deputie and councell for suffering the complainers vnpunished.</note>
with these their presumptuous and vndutifull maner of proc&eacute;eding; but also
found fault with the said deputie and hir councell there, that they would and did suffer
hir prerogatiue in contempt of hir highnesse and authoritie to be soimpugned, &amp; the
parties not committed &amp; punished: by which meanes the matter at the first and in
the beginning might haue beene remedied. And therefore as hir highmesse had alreadie
giuen order for committing them to the Fl&eacute;et, for the punishment of the agents
which were sent ouer with the complaints and letters, for such their instifieng and

mainteining the imposition of the said cesse to be against the lawes and customes of
that hir realme, and therefore s&eacute;eking to impeach hir prerogatiue and roiall authoritie:
but also willed and commanded him and all hir whole councell to send for
those lords and gentlemen, which subscribed the letters sent vnto hir highnesse,
who if they will stand to mainteine their assertions, and auow the imposition of the
<note place="marg">The complainers which subscribed to be sent and committed to ward.</note>
cesse to be against the lawes and customes of the realme, and not warrantable by
hir prerogatiue, that then hir pleasure was, that these persisting and auowing to be
likewise committed.</p>
<p>And concerning the abuses perpetrated in the maner of the leuieng the said cesse,
hir commandement and order was, that whosoeuer were culpable therein, he
should be punished with all seueritie. And herewith also she was contented, and
had giuen order for some qualification to be yeelded vnto, as by the said hir deputie
and councell should be thought m&eacute;et: considering the scarsitie and the dearth
which was then in the said English pale. And in case the said lords and gentlemen
<note place="marg">The complainers acknowledging their faults to be gentlie vsed.</note>
vpon better consideration will be contented to acknowledge their offenses, and
submit themselues simplie, and vnder their hand-writings: that then they to receiue
fauour. And as for those and such hir learned men, as were present at the debating
of the matter, and did forbeare (contrarie to their dutie &amp; knowledge) to stand in

mainteinance against the said prerogatiue, to be displaced and discharged out of hir
f&eacute;e, and their places to be supplied by such others as by the deputies shall be though
m&eacute;et. Immediatlie vpon the receipt of hir maiesties letters, and the like from the
councell, the lord deputie and councell by their letters sent not onelie for those malcontents,
<note place="marg">The malcontents &amp; their abbettors sent for.</note>
which had before subscribed to the letters sent to hir highnesse and councell;
but also in discretion for such others who for their disguised and cunning
manner of dealings were speciallie noted to be councellors, ringleaders, and procurors
of these letters to hir maiestie and the lords of hir councell: who when they
were come, and then being dealt withall, touching their claime of fr&eacute;edome from
cesse: their answers were arrogant and wilfull, and repining against hir maiesties
<note place="marg">The proud answers of the malcontents.</note>
prerogatiue, and affirming boldlie in plaine sp&eacute;eches and without anie sticking, that
no cesse could be imposed but by parlement or a grand councell; and whatsoeuer
was otherwise set downe, was against the law: and so stubbornelie they were bent
therein, that they would not yeeld to anie conference: wherevpon they were all
committed to the castell of Dublin, notwithstanding some of them (after they had
<note place="marg">The malcontents are all committed to prison.</note>
better aduised themselues) y&eacute;elded a submission and praied mercie.</p>
<p>Which dooings when the lord deputie and councell had foorthwith aduertised to
hir highnesse &amp; the councell in England; they nothing liking these arrogant and
disloiall parts of these impaled malecontents, sent for their agents; and hauing the
like conference with them, found them of like disposition, being as a fit couer to
the pot, verie froward, arrogant, and wilfull: wherevpon they were remooued from
the Fl&eacute;et to the Tower: a place appointed for the offendors in capitall causes, and
<note place="marg">The agents for their frowardnesses sent to the Tower.</note>
for such (being impugners of hir pre rogatiue) as be supposed to offend in the n&eacute;erest
degr&eacute;e to the highest. These things when were notified vnto the lords and gentlemen
in Ireland, they were maruellouslie gr&eacute;eued; but not the one nor the other would
giue ouer, vntill their arrogancies and insolencies were by apparant matter and good
records fullie conuinced, and condemned: for which the lord chancellor of verie
purpose was sent ouer into England, who so fullie, effectuallie, and discr&eacute;etlie did
<note place="marg">The lord chancellor of Ireland sent into England.</note>
resolue hir maiestie and councell in euerie point, which the parties agents could not
denie.</p>
<p>Now in the end they considered better of themselues, and sent their humble
<note place="marg">The agents submit themselues.</note>
submission in writing vnder their hands to the said lords of hir maiesties priuie
councell, confessing that they had disloiallie and insolentlie, both in words and

writings offended most gr&eacute;euouslie; protesting yet that their intent was neuer to
denie hir roiall prerogatiue, to vse the same as occasion should serue, but onelie to
redresse certeine abuses; and therefore most humblie praied they might find some
mercie, and that the hard and painfull imprisonment which they had susteined,
might be a sufficient punishment for the same. Wherevpon they were released,
<note place="marg">The agents were released vpon their bonds to appeare before the lord deputie and councell.</note>
putting in bonds of one thousand pounds, that within fiue daies they should depart
homewards into Ireland; and after their transportation &amp; arriuall thither, should
make their immediat repaire, without staie or lingering, to the lord deputie and
councell, and there to giue their attendance, vntill by them they should be licenced
to depart. At their comming home they performed the conditions of their obligations,
and most humblie in like order submitted themselues to the lord deputie and
councell, and then (according to an order thought good by the lords of the councell
in England, and referred to the liking of the lord deputie and councell in Ireland)
the same was after long trauerse ended and determined. But heere to set
downe what practises, informations, &amp; deuises were made against the said deputie,
by the said malecontents, and some (by their means) of no small calling had informed
that he had alienated the hearts of the subiects from ioiall obedience, that
he had farmed all the whole relme, that he had wasted hir maiesties treasures and
<note place="marg">The false accusations made against the lord deputie.</note>
reuenues, that he wanted policie in his gouernement, that he should for this dealing
with hir subiects be reuoked, that he did all things by his owne mind without the
aduise of others, contrarie to the course of other deputies before him, that he did
grant manie pardons, to the imboldening of manie which offended the more.</p>
<p>These and manie such other like vntruths they spred. But truth, which is the
daughter of time, did manifest it to the whole world, that their ouerthrow was his
credit, and his preuaile was to their reproch and shame. And albeit manie were
the pangs and inward gr&eacute;efes, which for a time by the meanes of their false suggestions
he susteined, and with great paines he couered: yet in the end it turned to
his great ioy and comfort. And here by the way, if a man without offense should
fall into the consideration of this their resistance, and repining against the cesse,
which was then enterprised and taken in hand; when the whole land stood in a
broken and doubtfull state, and the time verie dangerous; when the earle of Desmond
frowardlie kicked at the like, and all the lords in Mounster had contrarie to
their owne orders and promises, denied, and commanded their tenants to denie after
the manner of the English pale, to paie anie cesse; when Iames Fitzmoris being
furnished with men, monie, and munition, by the pope and king of Spaine, was
dailie looked for to come and inuade the land; and when the great ones hauing
hollow harts, and addicted to papistrie, did dailie gape and expect for the same;
when the disloiall Irishrie in Mounster and Connaugh were combined and ioined in
these conspiracies; when Rorie Og, Omore, Connor Mac Cormake, Oconnor &amp;
others, animated by the forsaid conspiracies, were vp in open rebellion, and vsed
most execrable outrages; when some of the best townes in Leinster did aid, comfort,
and mainteine these rebels, and besides manie other circumstances concurring
h&eacute;erewith: might it not be well presumed (and as it was so doubted) that the cause
being like, they should also be combined and linked alike? And might not the
whole world indge that neither barrell was the better herring? And yet notwithstanding
it fell in the end to a better effect. For the lords and inhabitants in the
English pale, since the time of the conquest by king Henrie the second, and since
<note place="marg">The fidelitie of the English pale to the crowne.</note>
their first arriuall into this land, it hath not b&eacute;ene lightlie knowne that they had
broken their faith and their allegiance, and not to rebell in anie warres against the
crowne of England, and the kings of the same; sauing as now in respect to saue
their pursses, rather than meaning anie breach of dutie, had ouer shot themselues:

which vpon a further consideration of the truth they repented, and vpon their submission
were pardoned, in hope and vpon their promise that they would neuer thensefoorth
offend, nor be found faultie with the like. During the trauerse about the
cesse, manie things happened in the land worthie to be reprehended (as great and
sundrie were the aduertisements from out of France by such Englishmen as were
there imploied) of an intention of Iames Fitzmoris to inuade Ireland, who had
b&eacute;ene at Rome with the pope, and there was he princelie interteined, and returned
from thense with a good masse of treasure, making his returne through Spaine, and
by the king thereof was furnished with men, munitions, &amp; treasures, and all things
necessarie. Which things were by letters from him signified vnto the ch&eacute;efest of
all Mounster his secret confederats, and they being papists both in bodie &amp; soule,
desirous of change of gouernement, and to be vnder a prince of their owne superstition,
did dailie languish and expect his comming. Wherefore hir maiestie and
councell, hauing the like intelligences, doo also prepare monie, munitions, vittels,
and men, and all other things necessarie for the withstanding of him.</p>
<p>Rorie Og, Omore, and Connor Mac Cormake, Oconnor, and their coparteners,
contrarie to their othes, submissions, and promises, hoping for aid out of Connaugh,
began anew to gather their fr&eacute;ends and confederats out of seuerall places, to the
number of a hundred swords, which with his owne made aboue seauen score; and
being animated by Shane Burke to continue a rebell, he burned diuerse mens haggards,
poore mens houses, and sundrie villages, and committed manie outrages:
and being not resisted, he tooke such incouragement of his successe, that leaning
poore villages, he went to great towns, as to the Naas, distant from Dublin about
<note place="marg">The burning of the Naas by Rorie Og.</note>
ten miles. The verie same daie that he came thither at night, was the patrone daie
of the said towne, commonlie called the church holie daie, which daie after the
maner of that countrie, and not much vnlike the festiuall daies which the Ethniks
and Pagans were woont to celebrate to their idoll gods of Bacchus and Venus, they
spent in gluttonie, drunkennesse, and surfetting. And after they had so filled
their panches, and the daie was gone, they somewhat late in the night went to
their beds, hauing forgotten to make fast their towne gates, or put anie watch to
ward them. Which thing Rorie Og when he knew, and hauing intelligence that
euerie man was in his bed asl&eacute;epe, then he in the dead night came to the towne
with all his companie, who like vnto a sort of furies and diuels new come out of
hell, carried vpon the ends of their poles flankes of fier, and did set as they went
the low thatched houses on fier. And the wind being then somewhat great and
vehement, one house tooke fier of another, and so in a trise and moment the whole
towne was burned; and yet in the towne supposed to be fiue hundred persons in
outward appearance, able to haue resisted them: but they being in their dead
sl&eacute;eps, suddenlie awaked, were so amazed, that they wist not what to doo, for the
fier was round about them and past quenching, and to pursue the enimie they were
altogither vnfurnished, and durst not to doo it, neither if they would they could
tell which way to follow him. For he taried verie little in the towne, sauing that
he sat a little while vpon the crosse in the market place, and beheld how the fire
round about him was in euerie house kindled, and whereat he made great ioy and
triumph, that he had doone and exploited so dinelish an act. And then after a
short space he arose and departed with great triumph according to his accustomed
vsage in all his euill actions, but yet contrarie to his vsage, he killed no one person
in the towne. As he returned he preied and spoiled the countrie, and ranging to
<note place="marg">Rorie Og burneth the towne at Leighlin bridge.</note>
and fro, as his wauering head carried him, he came verie shortlie vnto the towne at
Leighlin bridge, and there burned part of the towne.</p>
<p>But George Carew brother vnto Peter Carew, then constable of the said towne

and fort, hauing then but a small ward to defend the violence of the enimie, and
<note place="marg">George Carew with twelue persons against 240 setteth vpon them &amp; driueth them to flie.</note>
yet thinking it should be too great a dishonour vnto him to be bearded with a
traitor, and to let him depart vnfought withall: he issued out vpon him, hauing
with him onelie seuen horssemen and fiue shot, and gaue the charge vpon the said
rebels, being two hundred and fortie, with such a courage and valiantnesse (and
they astonied bicause it was so sudden and in the night time) that he killed some
of them: and then they with the losse of those men began to flie. But at last when
they perceiued his force to be but small, and too weake to resist their great number,
they returned and chased him to the verie walles of the castell; where if he
<note place="marg">The castell in danger to be taken.</note>
and his small companie had not like valiant and good souldiers acquited themselues,
the rebels had entred into the house; for they were within the gate and there fought,
but driuen out and the gate shut. At this bickering they lost sixt&eacute;ene men, and
one of their chiefe capteines named Piers Moinagh, who died verie shortlie after of
his hurt. Capteine Carew lost but two men and one horsse, but euerie one of
the rest of his companie was hurt.</p>
<p>The enimie, nothing triumphing nor liking this interteinement, presentlie retired
<note place="marg">The enimie is driuen to retire and flie awaie.</note>
and departed, by which meanes the one halfe of the towne was saued. After their
returne from hense, they spoiled sundrie townes and villages vpon the confines &amp;
borders of the English pale. And albeit they were verie egerlie followed and pursued,
and oftentimes with losse of his companie, yet he was so mainteined, and his
watch and spiall was so good, that partlie by the helpe of his acquaintance, and
partlie by meanes of the water bogs and fastenesse in euerie place, he was in safegard
and safetie. In this pursute made vpon him, it happened that a parl&eacute;e was
appointed betw&eacute;ene capteine Harington and him: vnto whom Rorie Og swore and
promised most faithfullie to yeeld himselfe to some conformitie and order. The
capteine nothing mistrusting him, gaue too much credit to his subtill promises, and
did so open himselfe vnto him, that through his owne follie Rorie tooke aduantage,
<note place="marg">Rorie Og by slight and deceipt taketh capteine Harington prisoner.</note>
and perforce tooke him and Alexander Cosbie, who was with him in hand, both
which he handfasted togither, and caried them along with him as his water spaniels,
thorough woods and bogs, threatening them still to kill them. This thing being
knowne, great sorow and greefe was conceiued of the lord deputie, and of all good
Englishmen, and dailie practises were deuised for their deliueries; and at length by
treatie of friends an agreement was in a manner concluded. But before the same
was fullie perfected, a draught was made by Robert Harepole constable of Catherlough,
<note place="marg">A draught made vpon Rorie Og by Harepole.</note>
to intrap and to make a draught vpon Rorie: for he knowing where the said
Borie was woont to hant, and by good espials learning where his cooch and cabine
was, he being accompanied with Parker lieutenant to capteine Furse and fiftie of
his band, earelie in the morning, about two houres before daie, he went and marched
to the verie place where Rorie laie, and beset the same. Rorie hearing an vnwoonted
noise, and suspecting the worst, he came suddenlie vpon Harington and Cosbie,
<note place="marg">Capteine Harington is hurt.</note>
thinking to haue slaine them, and gessing in the darke to the place where they laie,
gaue him diuerse wounds, but none deadlie; the greatest was the losse of the little
finger on his left hand. Robert Harepole when he had broken open the doore of
the cabin, he tooke as manic as were within prisoners: but Rorie himselfe and one
<note place="marg">Rorie Og escapeth.</note>
other priuilie in the darke stole awaie and crept among the bushes, so that he could
not be found. The souldiers in the meane time, making spoile of all such goods as
they found, killed all the men who were there, but saued capteine Harington and
Cosbie.</p>
<p>Rorie Og albeit he was glad that he was so escaped, yet in a great griefe for the

which he could get, besides them which Shane Burke had sent vnto him out of

Connagh, he went to Catherlough earlie in the morning, and burned a few haggards
<note place="marg">Rorie Og burneth Catherlough.</note>
of corne and a few houses, and so retired. Robert Harepole hearing hereof,
foorthwith followeth them with ten or twelue horsses which he had in a readinesse,
and at a foord not far off he ouertooke them, and killed sixt&eacute;ene or seuent&eacute;ene of
his best men, and Rorie himselfe escaped verie narowlie; and so continued still in
his former outrages, vntill he was intrapped and taken by a deuise of his owne to
intrap others, which was in this manner. Vpon the nine and twentith of Iune 1578,
<note place="marg"><date>1578</date></note>
he set foorth of purpose an espiall, whom he had cunninglie framed, and made
apt for the purpose to go to sir Barnard Fitzpatrike lord of vpper Osserie, and to
<note place="marg">A bait laid for the lord of vpper Osserie.</note>
tell him by the waie of great friendship and in secrecie, that Rorie Og had b&eacute;ene
of late in the countie of Kilkennie, and there had taken a great preie and spoile
of pots, pans, and other houshold-stuffe, which he might easilie take if he would
aduenture the matter; and if he did wiselie handle it, he might also take Rorie
himselfe and all his companie, which as he said (but vntrulie) that they were but
few in number. The lord of vpper Osserie, neither bel&eacute;euing nor yet mistrusting
this newes, and yet forecasting the worst, did put himselfe in readinesse to follow
the occasion that was offered; and taking with him a good companie of horssemer
and footmen, went towards the place where the bait was laied; and being come
n&eacute;ere vnto it made staie, or else he had b&eacute;ene intrapped, and sent thirtie of his men
into the woods to serch for Rorie. But the baron himselfe with certeine of his horssemen
and shot staied in the plaines, to attend the issue of the matter. The companie
were no sooner entered into the woods, but Rorie the rebell shewed himselfe with
a thirtie persons, the rest lieng in ambush; and he was of the opinion that his fame
and estimation was so great, and of such value among the Irishrie, that no man
durst to aduenture vpon him if he once saw his presence. But he was deceiued.
For at the first sight and view of him, the lord of Osseries Kerne gaue the charge
vpon him, and at their incounter one of them lighted vpon him, and with his sword
<note place="marg">Rorie Og is slaine.</note>
presentlie thrust him through the bodie: which was no sooner doone, but two
or three hacked vpon him, &amp; gaue him such deadlie wounds that he fell downe and
died, the same being the last daie of Iune beforesaid; and so this bloudie caitife,
deliting all in blond, perished and died in his owne bloud.</p>
<p>But before Rorie Og was thus brought to destruction, the lord deputie made a
<note place="marg">The lord deputie maketh a iournie vp&omacr; Rorie Og.</note>
iournie to the borders of Offallie and Lex, to haue met with the foresaid Rorie Og &amp;
his companions the Oconnors for the suppressing of their insolencie, who were growen
into such a pride by taking of capteine Harington, and their strength so increased,
that with most vndutifull termes they breathed out slanderous sp&eacute;eches against hir
maiestie, as which were not to be indured. Wherefore he beset the whole countrie
&amp; confines as he thought best, to stop their passage and to annoie them, &amp; so he
went to Kilkennie, and there by sundrie examinations found people of all degrees
in that towne to haue relieued the said Rorie with vittels and all other necessaries,
for his feeding and defense, with whome he tooke order according to their deserts.
At his being there he sent for the earle of Desmond to come vnto him, bicause he
had refused to come to the lord president when he sent for him sundrie times, and for
which cause the said lord president was there to complaine vpon him, as also that he
<note place="marg">The earle of Desm&omacr;d sent for to come to the lord deputie to Kilkennie.</note>
had of his owne authoritie, without anie warrant, gathered togither a rable of lewd
and vnrulie followers, which harried vp and downe the countrie, eating and spending
vpon the same, contrarie to all good orders, and which was not to be suffered.</p>
<p>Which earle foorthwith, vpon the receipt of the said letters, came to Kilkennie
to the lord deputie, and there being examined of those his vns&eacute;emelie parts, confessed
some part: and for excuse he alledged and much mistrusted and doubted
the president, least he would haue staied him, and haue vsed him hardlie, for which

<!--<fw place="top-left">"398"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>-->


he was blamed and reprooued by the lord deputie. But in the end, when they
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond and the lord president of Mounster are reconciled.</note>
came togither, they were reconciled and made good friends, and then he promised
vpon his returne home to disperse abroad his companions, and to obeie the president
as hir maiesties principall officer of that prouince, and to come vnto him at all commandements,
and which things he performed. For not long after he vttered and
bewraied to the said lord president the practises of Iames Fitzmoris, who by the
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond discouereth to the lord president Iames Fitzmoris his practises.</note>
arriuall of certeine Frenchmen and Irishmen vnto Sligo, in a ship of saint Malowes,
did what he could to stirre &amp; make a rebellion in Mounster and Connagh,
whereby a plot was laied for the staie of those Frenchmen, and the apprehension of
the Irishmen. These were good demonstrations to the 'otter shew of the obedience
and loialtie of the said earle, but in truth m&eacute;ere dissimulation, as afterwards it appeared.</p>
<p>Connagh
was in some part troubled, by means of Orwarke capteine of his surname;
in whose countrie there were certeine coiners of monie, and mainteined by
<note place="marg">Coiners in Connagh.</note>
him. The coronell vnderstanding hereof, he sent vnto Orwarke for them, and who
denied to deliuer anie of them: wherefore to correct that his pride, disobedience,
<note place="marg">Orwarke refusing to deliuer the coiners his castell is taken, and he submitteth himselfe.</note>
and insolencie, he sent a priuat band of footmen, who distressed Orwarke, slue his
men, tooke his castell, and put all the ward to the sword. Wherevpon he came
with all humilitie, and submitted himselfe, and craued pardon. All the residue of
Connagh was verie quiet, and increased hir maiesties reuenues to the yearelic summe
of eight&eacute;ene hundred pounds by the yeare, with good contentation. And now
when it was thought that all things were quiet throughout all Ireland; behold sudden
aduertisements were giuen both vnto hir maiestie and councell in England,
and to the lord deputie in Ireland, that Thomas Stukeleie was arriued out of Italic
<note place="marg">The Stukeleie suspected to come into Ireland.</note>
vnto Cadis in Spaine, with certeine men, ships, and munitions assigned vuto him
by the pope. And being accompanied with certeine strangers attending vpon him,
he was come to the seas, to land vpon some part of the realme of Ireland, in traitorous
maner to inuade the same, and to prouoke the people to ioine with him in
rebellion. All things, as well men, munitions, monie, vittels, and all other things
<note place="marg">Great preparation made against Stukeleie.</note>
necessarie were prouided and prepared for the preuenting of them, as well by sea
as by land: but in the end, aduertisement was giuen from out of Portugall, that his
enterprise was directed another waie, and to another purpose, and so all things were
quiet. Neuerthelesse, it appeared that he was in great fauour with the pope, and was
<note place="marg">The pope his fauour to Stukeleie.</note>
appointed to some speciall seruice against hir maiestie, if opportunitie would haue
serue &amp; all other things had fallen out as it was deuised. And for the incouraging
of him, the pope besides great treasures liberallie bestowed vpon him, he gaue him
<note place="marg">Stukeleie his honour and titles.</note>
sundrie titles of honour, and made him knight, baron of Rosse and Idron, vicount
of the Morough &amp; Kenshlagh, and earle of Wexford and Catherlough, and marquesse
of Leinster, and generall to the most holie father Gregorie the seuenth <emph>Pontifici
maximo.</emph></p>
<p>In the middle of these broiles, the vicount Baltinglasse, one of the chiefe impugners
and malecontents against the cesse, wrote his letters to the earle of Ormond,
then attendant at the court of England, and complaineth of great iniuries
<note place="marg">The vicount Baltinglasse complaineth to the earle of Ormond against sir Nicholas Bagnoll.</note>
and spoiles to the value of two hundred pounds in monie, besides numbers of

sir Nicholas Bagnoll knight marshall, when they were lodged one night in his house
at Baltinglasse, in the time that they serued vpon the rebell Rorie Og. Which

pitious and lamentable, and hir maiestie partlie persuaded (as a matter verie likelie
to be true) that such gr&eacute;euous extortions suffered vncorrected, made hir gouerne

ment more hatefull to that nation, than did anie of the Irish exactions: letters
<note place="marg">Hir maiestie sendeth letters in the behalfe of the vicount Baltinglasse.</note>

<note place="marg">The vicount Baltinglasse complaineth to the lord deputie against sir Nicholas Bagnoll.</note>
were sent to the lord deputie, to take care with all diligence, that the poore oppressed
might be satisfied, and the offendors also be punished, according to the
quantities and qualities of their offenses.</p>
<p>The lord deputie, before the receipt of these letters, was complained vnto by the
said vicount, and sir Nicholas Bagnoll was called to answer such hurts as were obiected
against him. And vpon the replication of the vicount, sir Lucas Dillon and
sir Thomas Fitzwilliams knights were appointed to examine all such witnesses, as
were brought foorth for proofe of the surmises, which in the end fell out to none
effect, for nothing could be prooued to anie purpose. But it appeared manifest of
the contrarie, by the report and testimonie of sundrie gentlemen of verie good
credit, and how that the said marshall at his first comming to that towne, had giuen
great charge to euerie capteine, to foresee that no iniurie should be offred, no
spoiles committed, nor anie thing to be taken by anie souldier or other person without
present paiment, protesting and proclaming execution according to marshall
law, vpon such as should doo the contrarie.</p>
<p>Likewise at his departure from thense, he made the like proclamation, that if
there were anie which had anie cause of complaint for anie wrong or iniurie doone,
or that anie thing were taken and not paied for, he should come and be beard, and
be satisfied. And by this it dooth appeare, that the surmises were made rather to
<note place="marg">The vicount Baltinglasses complaints are vntrue.</note>
aggrauat his gr&eacute;efe conceiued against the imposition of the cesse, than for anie
good matter in truth. Wherefore as he and his complices preuailed little in the
one, no more had he successe or credit in the other. For the matter was fullie certified
vnto the lords of the councell, and a request therewith made verie earnestlie,
that the said vicount might be reprooued, and also terrified to profer or practise any
such vntrue and indirect dealings. By these and other the like practises of the said
vicount, that bicause he did not brooke nor like of the cesse, he thought by waie
of exclames to aggrauat his owne case, that thereby the lord deputie might fall
into the dislike of hir maiestie, and be out of fauour, but the contrarie in the end
fell out to his owne reproofe and discredit.</p>
<p>When the lord deputie had ended and finished all his businesse, and had set the
<note place="marg">The whole land in peace.</note>
whole realme in order and peace, being now delinered from inward and ciuill warre,
and from the feare of Stukeleies inuasion, he prepared (according to hir maiesties
former letters of the six and twentith of March last past) to take his passage for
England, and to make his repaire to hir highnesse. And so when all things were accordinglie
prepared, and the wind &amp; weather so seruing, he deliuered vp the sword
according to hir maiesties commandement the six &amp; twentith of Maie 1578, vnto

<note place="marg">The sword is deliuered to sir William Drurie as lord iustice.</note>
sir William Drurie, then lord president of Mounster. And then being conducted
by the said now lord iustice and councell, and all the nobilitie, citizens &amp; people to
the waters side, he imbarked himselfe, taking his leaue in most honourable, louing,
and courteous maner of euerie man. And at his verie entring into the ship for his
<note place="marg">The departure of sir Henrie Sidneie, and of his last saiengs.</note>
farewell vnto that whole land and nation, he recited the words of the 114 psalme,
"In exitu Israel de Aegypto, &amp; domus Iacob de populo barbaro;" alluding thereby
to the troublesome state of Moses in the land of Aegypt, and of his departure from
out of the same: who notwithstanding he had in great wisedome, care, and policie
<note place="marg">The notable works of Moses, &amp; yet he not accepted.</note>
gouerned the stifnecked people of Israell, had doone many miracles and woonderous
works to their comfort, had deliuered them from manie great perils and dangers,
had preserued and also kept them in peace and safetie, had in the end through the
mightie hand of God brought them out of the hands of Pharao, and from out
of the land of Aegypt, and had giuen them the sight of the land of promise:
yet he found them alwaies a froward and peruerse generation, a stiffenecked and an

vngratefull people: euen no lesse as this noble man, and most woorthie gouernour
hath found of the people of this most curssed nation. Who notwithstanding he
was a verie painfull traueller both by daie and night, in fowle and in faire weathers,
<note place="marg">The painfull trauels of the lord deputie not considered.</note>
in stormes and in tempests, in troubles and in dangers, in scarsitie and in penurie,
in danger of the enimie and perill of his life: and yet continuallie studieng,
deuising, trauelling, toiling, and labouring to doo them good (as he did full manie
and often times) which so long as they felt the ease &amp; comfort, so long were they
contented and quiet: but otherwise most vngratefull and vnthankefull. And
offering vnto him the like reward as Licurgus receiued of the most vnthankfull
Lacedemonians, who when he had recouered that sauage nation to a ciuill life,
and a politike gouernement, and in the end reduced them to that order and maner,
as they became to be feared of all their neighbors, they in recompense euill intreated

for thousands and infinit commodities, would not onelie haue b&eacute;ereft his lordship of
both his eies, but also doone him a further inconuenience (if successe had happened)
according to their malice.</p>
<p>And now here by the waie, let it not be offensiue to set downe somewhat of much
concerning this woorthie and noble man for the course of his life. He was borne
and descended of a noble house and parentage, his father named sir William Sidneie,
<note place="marg">The parentage of sir Henrie Sidneie.</note>
a knight of great reputation and credit in the countie of Kent, and in great
fauour with king Henrie the eight, in whose time, and with his great good liking,
he and others lustie yoong gentlemen of the court trauelled into Spaine and other
nations, to visit and to s&eacute;e the maner of the emperours and other princes courts:
his mother descended of the house of Charles Brandon duke of Suffolke, vnto
whom she was verie n&eacute;ere alied. This yoong gentleman, his father being deceassed,
and he of verie tender and yoong y&eacute;eres, was brought vp in the court vnder the
same maister as was king Edward the sixt, and profited verie well, both in the Latine
and French toongs, for he had a verie good wit, and was verie forward in all
good actions, and whereof was conceiued some good things would come of him:
his countenance was verie amiable, and his behauiour verie gentle and courteous,
<note place="marg">Sir Henrie Sidneie was brought vp in the court.</note>
in whome king Henrie the eight (being his godfather) had a verie great liking, and
made him be attendant and plaiefellow with prince Edward.</p>
<p>The prince fell in such a good familiaritie and good liking of him, that he vsed
<note place="marg">Sir Henrie Sidneie the king his companion and bedfellow.</note>
him not onelie as a companion; but manie times as a bedfellow, and so delighted
in his companie, that for the most part they would neuer be asunder, neither in
health, nor in sickenesse, vntill the dieng daie of the prince: who then departed
<note place="marg">The king died in sir Henrie Sidneis armes.</note>
his life in this gentlemans armes. Somewhat before his death, the king gaue the
order of knighthood to this gentleman, for a memorie and a recompense of his
good will and loue: vpon which daie also he did the like vnto sir William Cicill,
<note place="marg">The king dubbeth sir Henrie Sidneie and sir William Cicill knights in one daie.</note>
now lord Burghlie and lord high treasuror of all England: by meanes of which
their conioined aduancement, there entred a verie feruent affection and good will
betw&eacute;ene them, with a reciproke answering of beneuolence each one to the other,
vntill their dieng daies. This noble gentleman for his forwardnesse in all good actions,
was as it were the paragon of the court, by reason of the manie good gifts
<note place="marg"><emph>Edm. Molincux.</emph></note>
which God had bestowed vpon him euerie waie. For concerning the bodie, he
was goodlie of person and well compact, and well beseene; he was comelie and of
a good countenance, he was so courteous and of so good behauiour, he was so wise
and so modest, so vertuous and so godlie, so discr&eacute;et and so sober, as he was another
Scipio: being but yoong in years, and old in behaniour, and finallie so rare a

man, as that age had not affoorded manie better. This man for his excellent good
gifts, he was made ambassador into France, being but about one and twentie yeares

of age; and twise in one yeare after that into Scotland: and by qu&eacute;ene
Maie ioined in commission with others to attend king Philip his comming into
England, for the mariage betw&eacute;ene their maiesties. And now in this hir maiesties
reigne, he was sent ambassador into France, to treat a peace or pacification betweene
the prince of Condie and the duke of Guise.</p>
<p>In the beginning and about the second or third yeare of hir maiesties reigne, he
<note place="marg">Sir Henrie Sidneie lord president of Wales and knight of the garter.</note>
was made knight of the garter, and lord president of Wales: and after one of hir maiesties
most honorable priuie councell. But before this, immediatlie vpon his retune
from out of Spaine, he accompanied the lord Thomas lord Fitzwaters his brother in
law into Ireland: where he was made treasuror at the wars, one of the principall

<note place="marg">He was lord iustice foure times.</note>

<note place="marg">The plot of sir Henrie Sidneies gouernement.</note>
offices in the land: and in course of time &amp; yeares for his excellencie in knowledge
and experience in that land, he was made lord iustice foure times and was lord deputie
thr&eacute;e times. In which offices, how he did most honorablie acquite himselfe.
his acts doo declare, and the summarie recitall shall partlie discouer and set downe.
He was no sooner placed in gouernement, but first and foorthwith he laid downe his
plot, wherevpon he would ground &amp; laie the foundation of his gouernement, and according
to it would he frame and direct all his actions: which plot and deuise consisteth
in these points; religion towards God, obedience to the prince, the peace of
the people, and the well gouernement in all things concerning the commonwealth,
either in causes ciuill or martiall.</p>
<p>Concerning religion, he was no more carefull in his owne person, but the like
<note place="marg">Religion.</note>
also in his priuat familie, where he had dailie exercises of praiers, both earlie and late,
morning &amp; euening, neither would he haue anie to serue him, who was not affected to
religion, and of an honest conuersation. Atheists and papists he detested, dronkards
and adulterers he abhorred, blasphemous and dissolute persons he could not abide.
And at his first being in authoritie in Ireland, &amp; finding the whole land generallie (a
few priuat places excepted) to be either of no religion, or of papisticall religion; and
being openlie by a preacher out of a pulpit aduertised, that in the remote places of
that land, manie a soule was borne which neuer receiued baptisme, nor knew anie
<note place="marg">Manie borne in Ireland neuer christened.</note>
christening; great was his gr&eacute;efe and much was he vnquieted, vntill he had found
the redresse thereof. Wherfore he aduertised hir maiestie, &amp; most earnestlie sued
&amp; praied for redresse &amp; reformation, which in the end was granted, &amp; a commission
sent to him for the same: which foorthwith he committed to the archbishops
&amp; bishops to execute, with whom he ioined, furthered and holpe them accordinglie
to the vttermost. But yet it tooke not that good effect as he wished and willed
it might. And as for ecclesiasticall liuings which were of his gift and disposition,
he would neuer bestow, but vpon such, as of whome he conceiued a good opinion,
both for his religion and honestie.</p>
<p>The prince, who was scarse knowne in manie places in that land, he brought both
to knowledge and obedience. The wild he tamed, the froward he reformed, the
disobedient he punished, the traitors he persecuted, the rebels he chastised, the
proud he made to stoope, and that arrogant and most insolent Shane Oneile, who
<note place="marg">Shane Oneile slaine.</note>
could abide no equall, nor acknowledge a superior, by a draught was brought to his
deserued confusion: &amp;whose head for a tropheie, &amp; for the example of Gods iusticeiaied

his vntamed springals he draue to submission, and to sweare dutie and obedience.
The vncoustant earle of Desmond and all his Giraldines and followers, and the proud
and vngratefull earle of Clancar, and all the Irishrie of his adherents, he made them
perforce to submit themselues, and to craue pardon. The Cauenaghs, the Otooles,

with Rorie Og, Pheon Mac Hew, and other their leaders and guides in Leinster he
<note place="marg">The rebels in Leinster tamed.</note>
tamed, and perforce compelled to sweare loialtie and subiection. Lastlie, the malecontents
against hir maiesties prerogatiue for the cesse in the end cried <emph>Peccaui,</emph> and
conformed themselues in all dutifulnesse. And when he had trauelled long in
<note place="marg">The malecontents against the cesse reformed.</note>
these affaires, which he saw could not haue continuance, vnlesse they by some other
meanes might be kept vnder gouernement: he by pithie persuasions, sound arguments,
great reasons, and continuall sutes to hir maiestie and councell, obteined to
haue rulers and gouernors to be placed in the remote prouinces, and sound, learned,
and vpright iust lawiers out of England to be sent ouer, for the direction of the gouernement,
according to the lawes of England: which in the end hir maiestie most
gratiouslie granted, and he most ioifullie obteined.</p>
<p>In Mounster therefore first he placed a coronell to breake the ise; namelie sir
Humfreie Gilbert, a valiant, a worthie, and a notable man, both for his martiall seruice,
<note place="marg">Sir Humfreie Gilbert coronell in Mounster.</note>

<note place="marg">Sir Iohn Perot, Sir William Drurie lord presidents in Mounster.</note>
and his ciuill gouernement: after him followed the like and worthie gentleman sir Iohn
Perot knight: and lastlie the valiant and prudent sir William Drurie, which both
were lord presidents. This man was afterwards lord iustice, and the other at these
presents is lord deputie of that land. In Connagh sir Edward Fitton knight, a verie
wise and a modest gentleman, late treasuror at armes, was lord president: and after
<note place="marg">Sir Edward Fitton and sir Nicholas Malbie gouernors in Connagh.</note>
him was sir Nicholas Malbie knight a valiant and expert man in martiall matters, and
verie wise and of good knowledge in publike and ciuill causes: who could verie exactlie
handle the sword, and vse the pen, he (I saie) was made coronell of all Connagh.
And how well the foresaid rulers and gouernors did rule by the sword, with
the assistance of their capteins, and how vprightlie they ministred law and iustice
by the aduice of the councellors in their seuerall prouinces, the records and registers
of their dooings doo at large witnesse and set foorth. The like order he tooke also
at Dublin, which being the metropole and chiefe citie of the whole land, and where
are hir maiesties principall and high courts, to answer the law to all sutors throughout
the whole realme: and he considering that a great defect was in the administration
of iustice in those courts, by reason of kinred, affinitic, and priuat affections
among the chiefe iudges and officers of that countrie birth: he by his like earnest
sutes to hir maiestie, procured them to be remoued, and their roomes to be supplied
<note place="marg">English lawyers placed to be iustices in the courts.</note>
with such wise, graue and learned Englishmen, as were sent from out of England to
be chiefe iustices, atturneie, and sollicitor. And further also, whereas there were
manie good lawes &amp; statutes established in the realme, which hitherto were laid vp
<note place="marg">The statutes to be revewed and printed.</note>
and shrouded in filth and cobwebs, and vtterlie vnknowne to the most part of the
whole land, and euerie man ignorant in the lawes of his owne natiue countrie, he
caused a through view, and a review to be made, and then a choise of all such statutes
as were most necessarie to be put in vse and execution: which being doone,
he caused to be put in print, to the great benefit of that whole nation.</p>
<p>And likewise for the records, which were verie euill kept, not fensed or defended
<note place="marg">The records searched and set vp in places conuenient.</note>
from raine and foule weather, but laie all in a chaos and a confused heap, without
anie regard; he caused to be viewed and sorted, and then prepared m&eacute;ete roomes,
presses, and places for the k&eacute;eping of them in safetie, and did appoint a speciall
officer with a yearelie f&eacute;e for the k&eacute;eping of them: and for all such matters
as were to be heard and determined in the castell chamber, before the
<note place="marg">The castell chamber dulie kept.</note>
lords, as it is in the starchamber in England; he would be for the most part
present at euerie court, and alwaies would haue the assistants and persons of hir
maiesties learned councellors. Neuerthelesse, he himselfe had a maruellous head
to conceiue, a d&eacute;epe iudgement to vnderstand, and a most eloquent toong to vtter
whatsoeuer was requisit to be spoken, either in that place, or in anie other assemblie;
which he would deliuer in such an eloquent phrase, and so pleasantlie it would flow
from him, with such pithie reasons, sound arguments, and effectuall discourses, as that

the lesse learned he was, the more strange it was that such great good things could come
out of his mouth. And such was his amiable countenance, his comelie behauior, his
commendable personage, that he would and did conquer their hearts, and gaine the
<note place="marg"><emph>Edm. Molincux.</emph></note>
loue of euerie man; and the people of all sorts would and did fall in loue with him for
his vprightnesse, indifferencie, and iustice, in determining of euerie mans cause. And
he knowing the nature and disposition of that people, who could not abide anie long
sutes in law, he was so affable and courteous, that euerie sutor should haue accesse
vnto him, and foorthwith he would heare his cause, and with such expedition would
cause the same to be determined, that he purchased to himselfe the vniuersall loue
of all the Irishrie, who thought themselues the more happie, if their causes might be
once brought to his hearing, &amp; the more willing to leaue their Obrian law, &amp; to imbrace
the course of the English lawes. Wherevpon he deuised, and consequentlie
with great policie and wisedome executed the diuision and distribution of the wild,
<note place="marg">The Irish grounds reduced into counties and shires.</note>
sauage, and Irish grounds into shire grounds and counties, appointing in euerie of
them shiriffes, constables, and all such kind of officers as are vsed to be in all other
counties: by which meaues hir maiesties writ had passage amongest them, and they
brought to the order of the English lawes &amp; gouernement, which neuer tofore was
heard or knowne among them.</p>
<p>When he had doone all such things as are before recited, for and concerning the
due course of gouernment by order of law: then also he bethought himselfe vpon
<note place="marg">The castell of Dublin repared.</note>
such other things as were necessarie in sundrie respects to be doone, as the castell and
house of Dublin, which before his comming was ruinous, foule, filthie, and greatlie decaied.
This he repared, and reedified, and made a verie faire house for the lord deputie
or the chiefe gouernor to reside &amp; dwell in. The towne of Carigfergus, being
<note place="marg">The towne of Carigfergus fortified.</note>
open to the northerne rebelles, he began to inclose with a wall and to fortifie, which
for shortnesse of time he could not finish. A gaole at Molengar he builded, a verie

towne of Athenrie in Connagh he caused to be reedified, &amp; the faire bridge of
Athlon vpon the d&eacute;epe and great riuer of the Shenin he builded with masonrie and
fr&eacute;e stone, and raised vp the walles &amp; battlements verie faire. By building of which
bridge a passage (neuer tofore had) was made open &amp; fi&eacute;e betwene the English pale
and Connagh, which more danted, apalled, and kept the rebelles in awe and obedience
than any thing before had doone. Sundrie like common workes he made and
did, and more would, if his residing there had continued. All which his forsaid doings,
<note place="marg">The qu&eacute;enes great charges to be rel&eacute;eued.</note>
no doubt, were verie chargeable to hir maiestie. And for easing whereof he
(as it became him) &amp; in verie deed had also promised and deuised how and by what
means these charges might be answered, and hir highnesse be rel&eacute;eued of the great
and intollerable charges which she dailie was at in that land, he did by good means

that nation: verie familiar, and a louer of all such as were learned and were men
of vnderstanding, whome he would honor and est&eacute;eme verie much gratefull to all
men, and a most louing maister to all such as serued him, whom he loued full
dearlie. And albeit he were a man of a great reach and iudgement, yet he would
<note place="marg">S&eacute;e more of this sir Henrie Sidneie in the English chronicles, An. Dom. 1586, noted by <emph>Edm. Molincux.</emph></note>
not doo anie thing without aduise &amp; counsell, for which purpose he made a speciall
choise of two singular men, who were priuie to all or most part of his actions; sir
Lucas Dillon knight, and Francis Agard esquier: the one a lawier, and yet not ignorant
in anie thing perteining either to the marshall affaires, or to the cruill gouernement:
the other a verie wise man, and of a d&eacute;epe iudgement and experience in all
matters of policies. And so true and trustie these were, that he named the one
<emph>Meus fidelix Lucas;</emph> and the other <emph>Meus fulus Achates.</emph> And notwithstanding in sundrie
and almost infinit respects, as partlie by the course of this historie it dooth
appeare, he hath deserued most hartie thanks, and a gratefull remembrance for euer

him. Not much vnlike the viper, who when he haib doone the act of generation
with his female, which (as the writers of naturalles saie) it is doone by the
mouth, she immediatlie biteth off his head, and so destroieth him; and likewise the
<note place="marg">The nature of the viper.</note>
yong, conceiued with the death of their sire or father, and nourished in the wombe
of their mother, and readie now to be borne &amp; brought foorth; they not abiding
their due time, most vnnaturallie doo knaw out hir wombe and bellie to hir confusion;
and so they are conceiued with the destruction of their father, and borne
with the confusion of their mother. This ungratfull people (I saie) notwithstanding
the innumerable benefits bestowed vpon them and that whole commonwealth,
yea and the dailie purchasing of their wealth, preseruation, and
<note place="marg">This was a troublesome parlement.</note>
safetie, could ne would be euer thankfull. As besides manie examples it appeared
at the parlement holden in the eleuenth yeare of hir maiesties reigne, where
when lawes were to be established for their benefit, and the abolshing of certeine
wicked and lewd vsages, which were among the Irishrie, they not onelie did impugue
and resist that assemblie, as much as in them laie: but recompensed the good things
(for their benefits established) with open war and rebellion against hir maiestie.
Also, when a reasonable and a vsed cesse was to be set and leuied for the benefit
<note place="marg">The cesse impugned.</note>
of the inhabitants and dwellers in the English pale; and for the represse of their
enimies which thirsted after their confusion: they immediatly repine and doo resist
the same. For this is their corrupt nature, that if he did at anie time pursue the
<note place="marg">The corrupt and vngratful nature of the Irishmen.</note>
enimie for their peace and quietnesse, and did aduenture neuer so great dangers for
them, were his successe neuer so good, yet would they enuie at him. If he by the
aduise of the councell did determine anie thing for their behoofe, yet would they mislike
it. If anie thing well meant had euill successe, they would like it; and vpon
neuer so little occasion offered they would make their complaints, libels should dailie
be exhibited, and accusations be deuised, with open mouths they would exclame,
and nothing would they leaue vndoone which might turne to his discredit and impechment
of his gouernement. But truth the daughter of time, which in the end
was manifested; and when he had y&eacute;elded before hir highnesse and councell a true
and a perfect account of all his dooings, and had trulie manifested the course of
his gouernement, then their glittering gold was found to be worse than copper, not
abiding the hammar; he according to his desert receiued thanks, and they reproch
and ignominie. Wherefore great good cause had he to be glad and ioifull, that he
was to be deliuered from so vngratfull a people and vnthankfull a nation. But shall

that they cannot brooke anie English gouernor; for be he neuer so iust, vpright, &amp;
carefull for their benefit, they care not for it: let him be neuer so beneficiall to their

commonwealth, they account not of it; let him be neuer so circumspect in his gouernement
and aduised in his dooings, they will discredit and impeach it. If he be
courteous and gentle, then like a sort of nettles they will sting him; if he be seuere,
they will cursse him; and let him doo the best he can, he shall neuer auoid nor
escape their malice and spite.</p>
<p>This noble and worthie man, who aboue all others had best triall thereof, thought
himselfe most happie when he was deliuered from them, and gone out of their
Egypt, and now returned to his owne natiue countrie of Chanaan, who thenseforth
sometimes attended the court, and serued hir maiestie as a most faithfull, graue, and
wise counsellor: sometimes he followed his charge and calling of president in Wales,
which office he did most honorablie vse and discharge. In the end, when Lachesis
had spun out the thread of his life, and Atropos readie to execute hir oflice, he fell
sicke at Worcester: and f&eacute;eling a decaie of nature, and that he did dailie wax
weaker and weaker, he y&eacute;elded and humbled himselfe to die; and holding vp
his hands, and lifting vp his eies, he continued in most hartie and incessant
praiers vnto God, craning with a most penitent hart, pardon for his sins, and
commending his soule into the hands and mercie of God, thorough the bloud
of Iesus Christ. And when his hands gaue ouer, his toong ceassed, and his
<note place="marg">The death of sir Henrie Sidneie.</note>
sight failed, he y&eacute;elded vp his spirit, and departed this life in a most godlie and
christian maner the fift daie of Male, one thousand fine hundred eightie and six.
His bodie was imbowelled, and his entrails were buried in the deans chapell of the
cathedrall church in Worcester: his hart was carried to Ludlow, &amp; there intoomed
in the toome that his welbeloued daughter Ambrosia was buried, which he had
builded in the collegiat church of the same towne; wherin he had erected a certeine
monument for a perpetuall remembrance to that town &amp; to Tikenhill, to which he
was verie much affected, &amp; made his most abode during the time of his presidencie.
<note place="marg"><emph>Edm. Molincux.</emph></note>
And from thense his bodie by easie iournies was verie honorablie caried to his house
of Peneshurst in Kent, &amp; in his parish church there he was interred in all honorable
maner, as to his estate did agr&eacute;e vpon the one and twentith of Iune, in the yeare
one thousand fiue hundred eightie and six, he being then about the age of seauen and
fiftie yeares. And thus this noble and worthie knight, who had spent the whole course
of his life in the dutifull seruice of his prince, and to the great benefit of the commonwealth,
is now deliuered vnto the euerlasting seruice of the eternall God, in
whose celestiall heauens he resteth in blisse and ioie with the foure and twentie
elders, who there are now beholding the face of God, and praising his holie name
for euer.</p>
<p>But to returne to the lord iustice, who being entered into the gouernement, and
<note place="marg">Sir William Drurie the lord iustice foloweth the course of his predecessor to rule in peace.</note>
finding it in some quiet state, did by the aduise of the councell follow that course as
n&eacute;ere as he could, as which was left vnto him; and by that meanes kept the whole
land verie quiet and in peace. For almost a yeare after his entrie into that office
and gouernement, vntill that Romish cockatrice, which a long time had set abrood
vpon hir egs, had now hatched hir chickins; which being venemous as were their sire,
raised, wrought, and bred great treasons, open warres, and hostilitie through out
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris an archtraitor.</note>
that land. For Iames Fitzmoris a Giraldine &amp; cousine germane to the earle of
Desmond, who not manie yeares before had beene an archtraitor, and a principall
capteine of the warres and rebellion in Mounster; and wherein he was then so folowed
at inches and pursued by sir Iohn Perot, then lord president of Mounster; that
after manie and sundrie conflicts, he was in the end compelled and inforced to yeeld and
submit himselfe, and to craue hir maiesties gratious pardon: insomuch that he came in

did humble and prostrate himselfe before the said lord president, and asked pardon,
swearing and promising then all dutifulnesse, truth, &amp; obedience for euer to hir
highnesse, and to the crowne of England.</p>
<p>Euen this periured caitife, who for his treasons and great outrages, villanies, and
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris hath his pardon sent vnto him.</note>
bloudsheds, had deserued a thousand deaths, and yet in hope of amendement hir maiestie
gane him his pardon, and sent it vnto him by hir seruant Francis Agard esquier:
euen this man (I saie) most traitorouslie fled into France, and there comming into
the kings presence, did offer to deliuer into his hands the whole realme and land of

Ireland, if that his maiestie would giue him aid, and furnish him with men and monie,
and such furniture as he should haue n&eacute;ed of in such an action. The king at the
first gaue him good countenance, great rewards, &amp; liberall interteinement, and accepted
his offer: but when he had well considered the matter, and had further looked
into the same, he changed his mind. Iames Fitzmoris, who had staied there in the
<note place="marg">The French king misliketh to deale in Ireland matters.</note>
French court about two yeares, and saw nothing go forward, &amp; the French king
waxed cold; who in the end gaue him no other answer, but that he would commend
him by his letters to his sister the queene of England, for obteining of a pardon for
him, and for hir good countenance towards him: he forsooke France, and made a
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris s&eacute;eketh to king Philip and to the pope.</note>
iournie into Spaine vnto king Philip. The king who had receiued the gift of Ireland
of the pope by meanes of the bishop of Cashell, being not willing to deale therein,
without his assistance &amp; aduise; Iames Fitzmoris made his iourneie from thense to the
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris his promise to king Philip and the pope.</note>
pope, vnto whom he declared that he had b&eacute;ene with king Philip, as dooth appeare
by his letters of credit to his holinesse; and that he would deliuer and cause to be deliuered
the kingdome of Ireland vp into their hands, and reduce the same againe to
the holie church of Rome, if he might haue men, monie, and such furniture of munitions,
&amp; other necessaries as should be requisit in that seruice. The pope was verie
glad of this sute, and liked it verie well, and did accept this offer, as also gane him
<note place="marg">The pope is glad of Iames Fitzmoris offer.</note>
good countenance and interteinement. And in the end vpon sundrie conferences betw&eacute;ene
the pope and king Philip, it was agr&eacute;ed betw&eacute;ene them, that Fitzmoris should
be furnished with men, monie, and all things necessarie for this seruice. Iames Fitzmoris
during his being in Rome, he fell acquainted with doctor Sanders an English
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris falleth acquainted with doctor Sanders and doctor Allen.</note>
Iesuit, &amp; doctor Allen an Irish Iesuit, and both traitors to hir maiestie and
crowne; and these two men being glad of such a sute, &amp; they in great fauor with the
pope, folowed the sute verie earnestlie, and promised to follow it to the vttermost in
their owne persons.</p>
<p>Now when all things were concluded betw&eacute;ene the pope and king Philip,
doctor Sanders, doctor Allen, and Iames Fitzmoris made their last repaire to the
pope, who foorthwith made Sanders his legat, &amp; gaue him the holie ghost, with
authoritie to blesse and cursse at his will and pleasure; and to him and the others
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris is furnished with ships and all necessaries.</note>
he gaue then also his blessing: and therewith his letters of commendation to king
Philip, who according to the conclusion made betw&eacute;ene them both, he was furnished
with all things m&eacute;et and necessarie for them. Wherevpon when time serued
they imbarked themselues, and their companie in thr&eacute;e ships well appointed for the
purpose, and arriued at Smereweeke, <emph>ali&agrave;s</emph> saint Marie w&eacute;eke, in the beginning of

Kensale a Deuonshire gentleman and a man of warre, named Thomas Courtneie, and
he hearing of the landing of this Iames Fitzmoris, and of the popes traitorous legats,
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris ships are taken awaie by one Thomas Courtneie a gentleman of Deuon.</note>
was contented, and by the persuasion of Henrie Dauels, being then in those parts;
and hauing a good wind, did come about and doubled the point, came into the baie
of Saint Marie w&eacute;eke or Smerweeke; and finding the three ships of Iames Fitzmoris
at anchor, was so bold in the waie of good speed to take them. And after that he
had staied there a while in that seruice, he tooke them all along with him: whereby
Iames Fitzmoris and his companie lost a p&eacute;ece of the popes blessing, for they were
altogither destituted of anie ship, to ease and rel&eacute;eue themselues by the seas, what
need soeuer should happen. As soone as they were thus landed, newes was sent and
carried abrode foorthwith to Iames &amp; Iohn brethren to the earle of Desmond, and so
consequentlie to the whole countrie. These two brethren, who had long looked for
<note place="marg">Sir Iames and sir Iohn of Desmond the earles brethren come to Iames Fitzmoris.</note>
the arriuall of this their cousine, and archtraitor, assembled all their tenants, folowers,
and friends; and out of hand made their present repaire vnto him: whose
commings and companies he accepted verie thankefullie, sauing that he had not a
thorough and a full liking of his cousine sir Iohn of Desmond. Which when sir
Iohn perceiued, he deuised how he would salue that sore, as most wickedlie afterwards
he did.</p>
<p>The earle of Desmond at this time was in reedifieng of a castell, which he had in
<note place="marg">The erle hearing of the landing of Iames Fitzmoris giueth ouer his buildings.</note>
the confines of Brenne Agonessis countrie, who assoone as he heard of the arriuall of
his cousine Iames Fitzmoris, he foorthwith did discharge and dismisse his whole companie
of workemen and labourers, pretending in outward shew what he neuer meant,
that he was to withstand and resist his cousine and all his companie, and foorthwith
maketh his repaire into Kerrie, and there assembleth all his followers and force, as
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond pretending some seruice against the rebeis sendeth to the earle of Clancar to ioine with him.</note>
though he would doo great things and worke miracles. And foorthwith likewise he
sent his letters to Mac Artie More earle of Clancar, &amp; willeth him in all hast to assemble
all the force he could make, and to make his sp&eacute;edie repaire to him, for vanquishing (if
they could) of the enimies now landed at S. Marie weeke. The earle of Desmond
in the meane time bad receiued a p&eacute;ece of the popes blessing, and his heat was
abated. But the erle of Clancar returned his answer, that he would come vnto him
<note place="marg">The earle of Clancar attendeth the earle of Desmond.</note>
with all sp&eacute;ed, and lie in campe with him where he would, as n&eacute;ere to the Dingle as he
might: and accordinglie he came to the place appointed. Which Desmond s&eacute;emed
to like well though it were against the splene, neuerthelesse when he saw the forwardnes
<note place="marg">Desmond liketh not Clancars readinesse.</note>
of Clancar, albeit he would not, nor yet well could in open termes fall
out with him, yet he deuiseth matters wherevpon he might haue some occasion to
dislike with him, &amp; to make him wearie of his companie. Which when Clancar perceiued,
<note place="marg">Clancar departeth from Desmond.</note>
and saw the vnwillinguesse of Desmond to doo anie seruice against the rebels,
but rather inclined towards them, he tooke the best opportunitie he could, and
departed awaie from him, and dismissed his companie.</p>
<p>The lord iustice, who was at Dublin, as soone as he was aduertised of Iames Fitzmoris
<note place="marg">The lord iustice prepareth to march into Mounster.</note>
landing, he maketh all the preparation he can, &amp; marcheth with all the qu&eacute;enes
force towards Mounster, dispatching also a messenger to hir maiestie of these toward
broiles and rebellion. But before he could prepare all things, as to such a great
action did apperteine, he sent Henrie Dauels an English gentleman before him,
<note place="marg">Henrie Dauels sent to the earle of Desmond.</note>
that he being verie well acquainted with the earle of Desmond and his brethren,

who as then had all his force and souldiers about him. From theuse he departed to

the fort, whereof when he had taken the view, &amp; saw the force as yet not so great but
might be easilie as yet ouerthrowne; he returned backe to the earle, and gaue him
aduise to draw all his force and companie towards the fort, persuading him to assaile
it while it was but weake, of small force, and easie to be taken, and that in so dooing
it should be greatlie to his honour. But the earle being not of so good a mind, or
<note place="marg">Desmond refuseth to giue the onset vpon Iames Fitzmoris.</note>
bent to doo so good a p&eacute;ece of seruice, answered; that he would not aduenture to
take so great an enterprise in hand with so small a companie as he then had. Then
Dauels went to sir Iames and to sir Iohn of Desmonds the earles brethren, and persuaded
them to aduise their brother the earle, either to doo that seruice which would
be to his great honour and commendation, or else that they would take it in hand;
which if they would also refuse it, that then the earle would spare to him a companie
of his Gallowglasses, and about thr&eacute;e score of his shot, and he would ioine with capteine
Courtneie who laie then within the baie with his mariners, &amp; he would giue the
assault by land, and the other should doo the like by sea.</p>
<p>But the earle, being mooued hereof, would not y&eacute;eld to this motion, but answered
<note place="marg">The earle refuseth to doo anie seruice.</note>
that his shot was more m&eacute;et to shoot at foule than fit to aduenture such a peece of
seruice, and his Gallowglasses were good men to incounter with Gallowglasses, and not
to answer old soldiers. Wherevpon when he saw the bent and disposition of the earle,
that he minded not to annoie, but rather to ioine, aid, and helpe the traitors: he togither
with the prouost marshall tooke their leaue of the earle, and minded to returne
backe vnto the lord iustice, to giue his lordship to vnderstand how all things stood, &amp;
<note place="marg">Henrie Dauels departeth from Desmond.</note>
what successe he had had in his message. And by the waie they laie that night at Traleigh,
which is about fiue miles from castell Maine, and laie that night in one Rices
house, who kept a vittelling house and a wine tauerne, the house being both strong
and defensible, but so little that their companies and seruants were dispersed, and
laie abroad in other places where they might have lodging. But sir Iohn of Desmond,
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn of Desmond followeth Dauels and corrupteth the porter.</note>
whose hart was imbrued with a bloudie intent, followed him, but somewhat
late, and came to the towne of Traleigh, and immediatlie set spies vpon Dauels, as
also had corrupted the man of the house which kept the gate, that he should leaue
the doores open. Henrie Dauels mistrusting no hurt, and least doubting of that tragedie
which was so n&eacute;ere at hand, especiallie to be done by him, whom of all the
men borne in that land he least doubted, &amp; best trusted, gat him to his bed; &amp; Arthur
Carter the prouost marshall with him. Now about the dead of the night, when
they were in their d&eacute;epe sl&eacute;epes, sir Iohn according to his wicked deuise came to the
house, the castell doore being left open for the purpose, with all his companie, euerie
one being armed and their swords drawne, and went forthwith vp into the chamber
where Dauels &amp; his companie were in their beds fast asl&eacute;epe, but with the noise they
were suddenlie awaked. When Dauels saw sir Iohn of Desmond armed and his
sword drawn, he was somwhat astonied at that sight, and rising vp in his bed said
vnto him (as he was ever woont to saie verie familiarlie) "What sonnel what is the
matter?" But he answered him; "No more sonne, nor no more father, but
make thy selfe readie, for die thon shalt." And foorthwith he &amp; his companie
<note place="marg">Henrie Dauels most cruellie murthered.</note>
strake at him &amp; his companion, both naked in their shirts, and most cruellie murthered
them both. Then they searched the whole house &amp; spared none, but put
all to the sword, sauing a boie named Smolkin, who laie in the chamber, and had
b&eacute;ene a continuall messenger betweene Dauels and this Iohn Desmond. This boie
s&eacute;eing his maister to be thus murthered ran vpon Iohn of Desmond, and held him by
<note place="marg">The faithfulnesse of a boie to his maister.</note>
the armes as well as he could, crieng; "What wilt thou kill my maister?" But he
answered; "Go thy waies Smolkin, thou shalt haue no harme." But the boie
seeing blowes still to be giuen, cast himselfe downe vpon his maister, crieng:
"If thou wilt kill him then kill me also." And so saued him as well, and so

long as he could. But it auailed not, for slaine and most cruellie he was there murthered.</p>
<p>This
Henrie Dauels was a gentleman, borne in Deuon, and descended of a verie
<note place="marg">Henrie Dauels what he was, and of his conditions.</note>
ancient and a worshipfull house, and being but a yoonger brother, and hauing but a
verie small portion left vnto him, when he came to some yeares and knowledge, he
gaue himselfe to serue in the warres. And king Henrie the eight, hauing then warres
against the French king, he entred into France to s&eacute;eke his aduenture: and there he
had verie good interteinment, and prooued to be a verie good souldiour. After
whose warres he serued in Scotland, and was in garrison at Barwike: and from thense
he was remooued into Ireland, where he serued vnder sir Nicholas Herne knight
conestable of Leighlin, and seneshall of Wexford; and so well he behaued himself
there, that he was commended for his good seruice towards the prince, well beloued
of his countriemen, and in maruelous fauour of the Irish people; for no seruice was
too hard for him in the kings causes; and so well he was acquainted with the countrie,
as no man better knew and had the skill to serue than he could there. As for
<note place="marg">The loue of Dauels to his countrimen.</note>
his countrimen, he was so d&eacute;ere and louing towards them, as he was more like a
father than a fr&eacute;end, and more like a fr&eacute;end than an vnacquainted countriman: for
he was an host and a harborer to euerie one of them, of what estate and condition
so euer he were of. For were he rich or poore, a gentleman or a begger, he was
fr&eacute;endlie to euerie one; and no man did or could lacke that interteinment, that he
was by anie manner of waie able to giue and affoord: which a number of Englishmen
tried and found to their great comfort, and to his euerlasting fame.</p>
<p>And as for the Irishmen, the longer he liued the better befoued among them: for
as he would not iniurie them, no more would he suffer them to be oppressed or
iniured: a great housek&eacute;eper amongst them, which they maruelouslie est&eacute;emed.
When he was in office among them, he was vpright and iudged righteouslie; if out
of office, louing &amp; fr&eacute;endlie to euerie man, and by that means so well (as no man
better) beloued and trusted. For what he had once said and promised, that would he
<note place="marg">The credit of Dauels word.</note>
surelie keepe and performe, and thereof it came into a bie-word in the countrie
where he dwelled, that if anie of them had spoken the word, which was assuredlie
looked to be performed, they would saie; Dauels hath said it: as who saith, it shall
be performed. For the nature of the Irishman is, that albeit he k&eacute;epeth faith for
the most part with no bodie, yet will he haue no man to breake with him. But
Henrie Dauels, he was so carefull of his word, that if he once promised, he would
not breake it for anie mans pleasure; and by that means he was so well beloued, that
his verie horsseboies had fr&eacute;e passage euen through the enimies, if he were knowne
to be Dauels man. And that which is more, as the writer hereof speaketh vpon
knowledge, that if anie Englishman had anie occasion to trauell in that countrie
thoroughout Leinster or Mounster, if he had but a horsseboie of his, he should not
onelie passe fr&eacute;elie thorough the countries without impeachment, but should haue
also verie good and fr&eacute;endlie interteinment. Among the noblemen he was greatlie
est&eacute;emed, and was in great fauour with the earles of Ormond and Desmond: who
although they were for the most part at iarres and contentions, yet Henrie Dauels
was in such fauour, as he could and did passe to and fro in the greatest matters of
importance betw&eacute;ene them: wherein he bare so indifferent a hand, as both parties
imbraced him for his vprightnesse and indifferencie. The erle of Ormond himselfe

of him, and such interteinment with him and especiallie sir Edmund Butler, that at
all needs and in all distresses they were sure to haue him to their fr&eacute;end; and manie
times it stood them in good st&eacute;ed.</p>

<p>And as for the earle of Desmond, though he were a verie vncerteine and a mutable
man, yet Henrie Dauels could prenaile with him; and were his furie neuer so hot,
and he neuer so hastie, yet could he appease and quiet him. And as for sir Iohn of
Desmond the earles brother, such was his profession and outward affection towards
him, of a most firme freendship; that it was thought to be impossible, that the loue
and goodwill betweene them could by anie meanes be dissolued. For in what
distresse so euer sir Iohn of Desmond was (as he was in manie) Henrie Dauels did
<note place="marg">Henrie Dauels alwaies a fast fr&eacute;end to sir Iohn of Desmond.</note>
alwaies helpe him, and at sundrie times red&eacute;emed him out of prison, yea out of the
castell of Dublin, when he was committed for capitall crimes, and became suertie
for him in great sums of monie, and became pledge bodie for bodie for him; Dauels
pursse was at his commandement, his house at his deuotion, and what he had at his
disposition. And so farre this good will grew betweene them, that Iohn of Desmond,
as one knowledging himselfe most bounden to him, did call him father; euen as the
other called him sonne. And now s&eacute;e, when treason and treacherie was entred into
him, how contrarie to all faith, fr&eacute;endship, and humanitie, the sonne most vnuaturallie
bereft the father of his life, and most cruellie murthered him. Wo worth to
so wicked a villaine, that so bereft the prince of so faithfull a subiect, the gouernors
of so trustie a seruitor, the commonwealth of so good a member, of a man most dutifull
to his superiors, vpright in iustice, trustie in seruice, expert in the warres,
faithfull vnto his freend, louing to his countrie, fauoured of all men, hurtfull to no
man, of great hospitalitie to all good men, good to all men, a father vnto the distressed,
and a succorer of the oppressed; finallie such a rare man of his degree and
calling, as few like haue b&eacute;ene found in that land; and yet against all pittie and
mercie, most cruellie murthered by a traitor to God and his prince, euen to the
gr&eacute;efe of the traitors of his owne brood. But here it falleth out that is of old said;
Saue a murtherer or a theefe from the gallowes, and he shall be the first that shall
cut thy throte.</p>
<p>When this bloudie murtherer had executed this crueltie vpon his good freend, he
foorthwith made his repaire to Iames Fitzmoris, and to his doctors and companie in
great brauerie, recompting vnto them what a noble act and a valiant seruice he had
doone in murthering of an honest, faithfull, &amp; friendlie gentleman, saieng; I haue
now killed an English churle (for so maliciouslie the Irishmen terme all Englishmen)
<note place="marg">The brags of Iohn Desmond for killing of Dauels.</note>
&amp; said to his cousine Iames; Now thou maist be assured of me and trust me, for now
that I haue begun to dip my hand in blood, I will now stand to the matter with thee
to my vttermost. Iames Fitzmoris when he had heard him at full, although both he
<note place="marg">His crueltie misliked.</note>
and his doctors, and the whole companie of the Spaniards did reioise and were glad
of his death, yet Iames did blame and abhorre the maner of his death, blaming and
reproouing him verie much, that he should murther him in his bed, being naked and
scarse awaked out of his sl&eacute;epe, which he said was too cruell, bicause he might
otherwise haue had aduantage vpon him either by the high waies or otherwise to his
commendation. Howbeit, doctor Sanders terming his bloudie murther to be a sweet
<note place="marg">The popes doctors doo allow and commend the murther.</note>
sacrifice before God, did both allow it, and gaue him plenarie remission of all his
sinnes. The earle himselfe likewise, when he heard hereof, he was maruelouslie
gr&eacute;eued and offended with his brother, and gaue him such sharpe sp&eacute;eches and
reproofes, as it was thought they would not so soone haue beene fr&eacute;ends againe:
but wicked dooings amongst the wicked establish and confirme them in their wickednesse.
At this present time, there was with the earle (as verie often he had b&eacute;ene)
one Appesleie an English capteine, who could doo verie much with him, and vpon
the hearing of the death of his good friend Henrie Dauels, he began to doubt and
mistrust of himselfe and of his owne assurance. Wherefore he goeth to the earle,

and dissembling his griefe, persuadeth him to draw his companie togither, and to
remooue from thense to his house of Asketten, which is about fourt&eacute;ene miles from
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond remooueth to Asketten.</note>
Limerike, and there to abide the comming of the lord iustice, and to ioine with him
in this seruice against the enimie. The earle, who minded nothing lesse than so to
serue, dissembled the matter, and followed this counsell, and remooued from thense
to Asketten, where he laie close and did nothing, but still s&eacute;emed in speeches and
outward shewes to mislike with Iames Fitzmoris and all his companie; and yet dailie
his best followers and soldiers flocked and repaired to Iames Fitzmoris, manie of
<note place="marg">The earles chiefe men turne to the enimie.</note>
them for zeale to the popish religion, wherin they were as deuout as the popes legates
and the Spaniards: but manie of them knowing the earles intent, did it for
feare and auoiding of his displesure. The Spaniards, who had continued there in
the fort and elsewhere, and not finding the repaire of the souldiers, nor yet anie
other thing answerable to that seruice as it was promised them, began to mislike it;
<note place="marg">The Spaniards like not their c&omacr;ming.</note>
and distrusting of anie good successe, did repent and were sorie, wishing themselues
at home againe: but such was their case, that they could not shift for themselues to
escape neither by sea nor by land; and therefore necessitie so compelling, they resolued
themselues to abide the brunt.</p>
<p>Iames Fitzmoris, perceiuing their discontented minds, had conference with them,
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris persuadeth the Spaniards to patience.</note>
&amp; persuaded them to be of a good comfort, for they should verie shortlie haue a
greater supplie and companie which he dailie looked for, and all things should be
had according to their owne minds: aduertising them that in the meane time he was
to take a iournie to a place of thr&eacute;e or foure daies iournie from thense, called the holie
rood or crosse in Tipporarie, and there to performe a vow which he had before
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris pretendeth a pilgrimage.</note>
made when he was in Spaine, praieng their patience. But in verie truth his intent
was to trauell into Connagh and into Vlster, and in both his waies, his neerest waie
was through Tipporarie, and there to flocke and draw vnto him all and so manie of
the rebels as he could wage to ioine with him, whereof he made no doubt, but
assured himselfe to find as manie readie to go as he willing to haue. And so taking
his iournie with thr&eacute;e or foure horssemen, and a dozzen Kernes, he passed through
the countie of Limerike, &amp; came into the countrie of sir William Burke his verie
n&eacute;ere cousine and kinsman, and who before in the last rebellion did ioine with him,
to the great danger of his life and losse of all his goods.</p>
<p>And when he came so farre in his iournie, being now about thr&eacute;e score miles from
S. Marie w&eacute;eke, his cariage horsses (which they terme garons) waxed faint, and could
not trauell anie further: wherefore he commanded some of his men to go before, &amp;
looke what garrons they first found in the fields, they should take them and bring
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris stealeth garrons.</note>
them vnto him. And as it fell out they espied a plow of garrons plowing in the
field, which they foorthwith tooke perforce from the poore husbandmen two of them,
and caried them awaie. Wherevpon according to the custome of the countrie, the
hobub or the hue and crie was raised. Some of the people followed the tract, &amp;
some went to their lords house, which was sir William Burke being n&eacute;ere at hand to
<note place="marg">The Burkes follow the preie.</note>
aduertise the matter, who hauing three or foure of his sonnes and verie tall gentlemen
at home with him, they tooke their horsses and a few Kernes and two shot with
<note place="marg">This was a draught made by the lord president.</note>
them, and followed the tract, and ouertooke them at a fastenes fast by the woods
side, where they found Iames Fitzmoris, whome before they knew not to be come
into those parties, to make head to answer them. But when he saw that it was his
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris maketh head to resist.</note>
cousine Theobald Burke and his brother and his companie, who had beene his companions
in the late rebellion when sir Iohn Perot was lord president of Mounster, he
spake ouer vnto them, and said; "Cousine Theobald (who was the eldest son to his
father) two carriage horsses shall be no breach betweene vs two; and I hope that
you which doo know the cause that I haue now in hand, you will take my part therein,

and doo as I and others will doo:" and so continuing some sp&egrave;eches, did what
he could to draw him and all his companie to be partakers in this rebellion. But he
answered that he and his father had alreadie dealt too much that waie with him, and
that he will neuer doo the like againe: for his father, he, and all his brethren, had
sworne to be true, obedient, and faithfull to the qu&eacute;enes maiestie, and which oth
they would neuer breake: cursing the daie and time that euer they ioined with him
in so bad a cause against hir maiestie, and therefore required to haue his garrons
againe, or else he would come by them aswell as he could.</p>
<p>Iames Fitzmoris standing vpon his reputation, thought it too much dishonorable
vnto him to depart with that which he had in hand; and therfore vtterlie denied the
deliuerie, and therevpon each partie set spurre to the horsses and incountered the
one the other. The skirmish was verie liot and cruell, and Theobald Burke &amp; one of
his yoonger brethren were slaine, &amp; some of their men. Iames Fitzmoris likewise
and his companie had the like successe, for he himselfe was first hurt and wounded,
and then with a shot striken thorough the head, and so was slaine, with sundrie of
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris slaine.</note>
his companions: wherein he found that the popes blessings and warrant, his <emph>Agnus
Dei,</emph> and his graines had not those vertues to saue him, as an Irish staffe or a bullet
<note place="marg">Some thinke that this p&eacute;ece of seruice was a draught made by sir William Drurie lord iustice.</note>
had to kill him. Thus was hir highnesse most happie, and that whole land most
happiest, that they were deliuered from so wicked and bloudie a traitour, and that the
great &amp; venemous hydra was thus shortened of one of his heds. For otherwise it
was to be doubted that if he had lined, he would haue bin the cause of much bloudshed,
and all the rebels in that land would haue ioined with him. For he was of
verie good credit &amp; estimation through the whole land, he was of a verie good
<note place="marg">The conditions of Iames Fitzmoris.</note>
gouernement, and of a great reach; but a d&eacute;epe dissembler, passing subtill, and
able to compasse anie matter which he tooke in hand, familiar to all men, and verie
courteous, valiant, and verie expert in martiall affaires, but so addicted to poperie
and that baggage religion, that he became a most horrible traitour to hir maiestie,
and a mortall enimie to euerie good man: and so far he was imbrued herein, that a
man might saie that he was borne to the same end, euen to be a traitor and a rebell
to God, to his prince, and to the whole commonwealth.</p>
<p>After that he was thus dead, and the same made knowen to the lord iustice, he
gaue order that he should be hanged in the open market of Kilmallocke, &amp; be beheaded
&amp; quartered, &amp; the quarters to be set vpon the towne gates of Kilmallocke,
<note place="marg">Iames Fitzmoris his quarters set vp&omacr; the gates of Kilmallocke.</note>
for a perpetuall memoriall to his reproch for his tresons and periuries, contrarie to his
solemne oth taken in that errour. Hir maiestie, when she was aduertised of this
p&eacute;ece of good seruice of sir William Burke and the losse of his eldest sonne, she
wrote hir letters of the good acceptation of his seruice, comforted him for the losse
of his son, and in recompense did create him baron of the castell of Connell by hir

him the yearelie pension of a hundred marks, to be paid at hir maiesties exchecker

to be deal.</p>
<p>When newes of the death of Iames Fitzmoris was brought to the fort at S. Marie
weeke, great sorow was amongest them all, they being all amazed and wist not what
<note place="marg">The Spaniards amazed with the deth of Fitzmoris.</note>
to doo, especiallie the Spaniards who depart could not, and to submit themselues
they would not, and yet they were of the mind to giue ouer and to intreat for a

forces which hir maiestie had in that land, which was but foure hundred footmen and
two hundred horssemen, a verie small companie for so great seruice towards: yet
considering that the victorie consisteth not in the arme of man, nor in horsse or
mule, but onelie in the good gift of God; he marcheth foorth in his iournie, hauing
in his companie of Englishmen sir Nicholas Bagnoll knight marshall, sir Nicholas
Malbie coronell of Connagh, Iaques Wingfield master of the ordinance, and Edward
Waterhouse one of hir maiesties seruants, Edward Fitton, Thomas Masterson,
and others. And of the Irish lords he was accompanied with the earle of Kildare,
sir Lucas Dillon chiefe baron, the vicount Mountgarret, the baron of vpper Osserie,
and the baron of Dunboine, who had of themselues two hundred horssemen, besides
footmen and Kernes: and so they marched forward by iourneis vntill they came to
Kilmallocke, where not farre from the towne they all incamped: &amp; then he sent
<note place="marg">The lord iustice incampeth neere to Kilmallocke.</note>
from thense a messenger to the earle of Desmond, and so likewise to all the principall
gentlemen of the best accompt in those parties, to come vnto him.</p>
<p>The earle in outward app&eacute;erance seemed verie willing to come, but vntill he had
receiued some promise of fauour from the lord iustice, he still lingered and trifled
the time and came not. But in the end his lordship being verie well accompanied
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond cometh to the lord iustice to the campe.</note>
with horssemen and footmen, he went to the campe, and presented himselfe before
the lord iustice, and made a shew of all dutifulnesse, obedience, &amp; fidelitie, whereas
ind&eacute;ed no such thing was ment. For though his bodie were there, his mind was
elsewhere: for whiles he was in the campe, sundrie trecheries were practised by
him; yet they were not so secretlie doone but they came to light, &amp; were discouered
to the lord iustice. Wherevpon he was committed to the custodie of the knight
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond is c&omacr;mmitted to ward.</note>

<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond dooth humble himselfe and sweareth to serue trulie.</note>
marshall. Whiles he was in his ward, and fearing least some greater matters would
be reuealed against him, he praied accesse to the lord iustice; and then he humbled
himselfe verie much, and promised and sware vpon his honour &amp; allegiance, that he
would faithfullie and to the vttermost of his power serue hir highnesse against the
rebels. Whose humblenesse and promise the lord iustice by the aduise of the councell
did accept, and so inlarged him: which was in the end the vtrer confusion of
the earle himselfe and all his familie, and in the meane time great troubles, causes of
much bloudshed, and vndooing of all Mounster.</p>
<p>Whiles the lord iustice laie thus in campe about Kilmallocke, newes was brought
vnto him, that sir Iohn of Desmond was incamped with a great companie of the
<note place="marg">Iohn of Desmond incampeth at Slewlougher.</note>
rebels vpon the borders of Slewlougher. Wherevpon his lordship remooued and
marched thitherwards, the earle then promising that he would in person incounter
and fight hand to hand with his brother. Now when they were come to the place of
seruice, the earle being best acquainted with the countrie, gaue aduise to the lord
iustice, that he should diuide the armie into two parts, and the lord instice should
take one waie, and he the earle would take another waie: which aduise was followed.
But bicause that place of the present seruice is adioining to a great wood, and
wherein were manie fastnesse, the lord iustice did diuide the rest of his companie
into two other parts, and so euerie of these three companies tooke waie into the
wood &amp; serched it throughout, but there they found no bodie. For sir Iohn had
some secret knowledge of the lord iustices comming, and so was gone before.</p>
<p>The dale being spent to small purpose, &amp; the night drawne towards, be incamped
that night in the same places where the rebels had lien before, &amp; there he remained
somewhat longer than he thought: bicause he would spend and wast the forrage of
that countrie, which was one of the chiefest places of reliefe that the enimies had.
And from thense he went backe againe towards Kilmallocke, where he incamped
himselfe at a place called Gilbons towne, which lieth in the plaines betw&eacute;ene Limerike
and Kilmallocke towards Emeleie and Harlo; &amp; there he continued about nine

w&eacute;ekes in continuall toiling and trauelling to and fro, in all such seruices as was
dailie offered to be doone vpon the enimie, from which he had no rest neither day
nor night. Whervpon for the better seruice he diuided his hands, and tooke out of
the Irish companies one hundred, and deliuered them to the guiding of capteine
Iohn Herbert, a man of verie good seruice, and one other hundred to capteine
Prise.</p>
<p>These two capteins had made spiall vpon certeine rebels, which shrowded themselues
in the great wood called the blacke wood, vpon whom they made a sallie,
and did verie good seruice vpon them. But as they were to returne to the campe,
which laie beside Getenbre castell, the said Iohn of Desmond, who laie in ambush
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn of Desm&omacr;d lieth in an ambush for the English capteins and discomfiteth them.</note>
for them, met and incountered them, where was a sharpe fight betwixt them, and the
two capteins with the most part of their companie slaine: &amp; Iohn of Desmond himselfe
was there hurt in the nose. The losse of those two capteins and their men was
a great weakening to the lord iustice his armie; his enimies being strong and manie:
and his companie weake and few, sauing at that instant the souldiers sent out of
Deuon and Cornewall arriued at Waterford to the number of six hundred men, vnder
<note place="marg">The Deuonshire souldiers arriue at Waterford.</note>
the leading of capteine George Bourchier, capteine Peter Carew, capteine George
Carew his brother, and capteine Dowdale, whose comming at so present a distresse
was both ioifull and also gladsome.</p>
<p>And n&eacute;ere about this time, it was aduertised vnto the lord iustice, that Iohn of
Desmond was at Connell, which was about sixteene miles from the campe: and his
lordship being well furnished &amp; prepared, and he minding to doo some peece of seruice
vpon him, made verie secretlie a iourneie thither: but Desmond wanting not
his good espials, had an inkling and a knowledge thereof, and so shifted himselfe
awaie, wherevpon the lord iustice returned to his campe. The queens maiestie and
councell, being alwaies mindfull of hir Ireland, and by reason of the newes that the
enimies were dailie stronger and stronger, she sent ouer sir Iohn Perot late president
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn Perot sent to serue on sea.</note>
of Mounster, with six ships well furnished and appointed, whereof he was admerall;
and William Gorge master porter of the tower and a pensioner, viceadmerall: and
all these arriued vnto the citic of Corke. Whereof the lord iustice being aduertised,
was verie glad, and did appoint one hundred vnto sir William Stanleie, who before
was capteine of certeine horssemen, and one other hundred be assigned vnto capteine
Hind. And s&eacute;eing now some good seruice towards, and to incourage certeine
gentlemen to be the more willing to follow the same, called before him George
Bourchier, William Stanleie, Peter Carew, and Edward Moore, and vsing vnto
<note place="marg">Knights dubbed in the field.</note>
them verie good sp&eacute;eches, to incourage and persuade them to doo hir maiestie good
seruice in these hir affaires, and in hope they would performe the same, he dubbed
them knights: who accordinglie did acquit themselues, and some of them with the
losse of their liues ended their daies in this seruice.</p>
<p>And he further also for his owne part, the more h&eacute;e bethought himselfe of the great
seruice and charge laid vpon him, the more carefull he was to doo what the same required:
where, in his owne person he so toiled and trauelled, and so ouercame himselfe
with studieng, watching, labouring and trauelling, that he ouerthrew his owne
health, and was no longer able to indure the same: but being ouercome by sicknesse,
<note place="marg">Sir William Drurie falleth sicke &amp; goeth to Waterford.</note>
and driuen to y&eacute;eld therevnto, was determined to haue dissolued his campe, and so
to haue returned to Waterford, and there to staie for a time. But the capteins
s&eacute;eing the necessitie of the present seruice, persuaded him not to dissolue the armie,
but to take some order herein for hir highnesse seruice, and he to sequester himselfe
for a time for his health. Vpon whose aduises he prepared himselfe to trauell
towards Waterford, and for the continuance of the seruice did commit the gouernement
<note place="marg">Sir Nicholas Malbie made gouernor of Mounster.</note>
to sir Nicholas Malbie, who was then gouernour by the name of coronell of

Connagh; and then by easie iourneies h&eacute;e came to Waterford, and there he found
himselfe euerie daie more weaker than other, and in the end did distrust his owne
recouerie.</p>
<p>And yet mindfull of hir maiesties seruice, he to incourage other therein, sent &amp;
<note place="marg">Knights dubbed at Waterford.</note>
called before him William Pelham esquier, William Gorge esquier viceadmerall of
the six ships, Thomas Perot sonne and heire to sir Iohn Perot, and Patrike Welsh
maior of the citie of Waterford, and gaue vnto them the order of knighthood, vsing
the like persuasions as heretofore he had doone vnto others in the like case. And
albeit he were of a good heart and courage, yet that was no sufficient physicke to
recouer his helth of bodie, but that still decaied. And douting verie much of his recouerie,
he sent to Dublin to the lord chancellor, and to the ladie Thame his wife,
for their speedie comming vnto him, who accordinglie satisfied his request. But he
inioied their companie a verie short time: for he died within two daies after their
<note place="marg">Sir William Drurie lord iustice dieth.</note>
comming, being the last of September 1579, and after his death his bodie was caried
vnto Dublin, where it was buried.</p>
<p>But here by the waie (which should before haue b&eacute;ene said) as he came towards
Waterford through Tipporarie, the countesse of Desmond met with him, and brought
<note place="marg">The countesse of Desmond giueth hir son to be a pledge for his father.</note>
with hir hir onelie sonne and heire to the earle; and being a sutor in the behalfe of
hir husband, presented him to the lord iustice to be a pledge for the truth and fidelitie
of the earle hir husband. For after the time that he was set at libertie in the campe
n&eacute;ere Kilmallocke, he neuer repaired any more to the lord iustice, but stood vpon
his owne k&eacute;eping; notwithstanding by his letters he professed all loialtie and obedience,
which he neuer meant. For in verie truth he was (notwithstanding his dissembling)
a verie ranke traitor, as in open fact and action did verie shortlie appeare,
to his owne deserued confusion.</p>
<p>But to returne to sir Nicholas Malbie, who immediatlie vpon the departure of sir
William Drurie vnto Waterford, according to the office &amp; charge laid vpon him, be
set in hand foorthwith to follow and performe the same. For he was able to do it
being of great experience in martiall affaires, hauing b&eacute;ene seruitor that waie vnder
sundrie kings, &amp; in strange nations; as also was verie wise, lerned, and of great
<note place="marg">The commendation of sir Nicholas Mabie.</note>
knowledge in matters of policie, hauing b&eacute;ene a student in good letters, and a great traueller
in sundrie nations, &amp; therein did obserue the maner of the seuerall gouernments
in euerie such place as where he trauelled. He had vnder him in the whole an hundred
and fiftie horssemen, and nine hundred footmen, to command; and diuiding
them according to the seruice then in hand, he sent sir George Bourchier, capteine
Dowdall, and capteine Sentleger, vnto Kilmallocke with three hundred footmen, and
with fiftie horsmen, there to lie in garrison, and a speciall place m&eacute;et for the same,
&amp; which the enimie most speciallie coueted to possesse. But the more his care was
that waie, the like was their diligence, vigilancie, &amp; care of the other waie to k&eacute;epe
the same. Then with the residue of the companie he marched himselfe to the citie
of Limerike, where he staied and remained for a time to refresh his souldiors.</p>
<p>During his abode and being there, it was thought good by him and his capteins,
<note place="marg">The gouernor sendeth for the earle of Desmond.</note>
to send vnto the earle of Desmond for his repaire vnto him, and to haue conference
with him, to vnderstand his bent and aduise for hir maiesties seruice against the
enimies. The earle hauing receiued the gouernours letters, gaue verie good woords,
<note place="marg">The earle giueth onelie words and dissembleth.</note>
&amp; promised much, but performed nothing. Wherefore he was againe and againe sent
for from time to time, but he came not, but laie still at his house of Asketten, which
is about fourtene miles from Limerike. For albeit as yet he was not in anie actuall
rebellion, yet it was not vnknowne but that he was secretlie combined with his two
brethren, which as open traitors were in open rebellion and in armes against hir maiestie.
Which the earle, suspecting the same might be laid vnto his charge, would

not aduenture himselfe to come in person to the gouernor; but still fed him with faire
words and friuolous answers. Wherefore the gouernor thought good to spend no
more time in vaine to looke for him, but left Limerike, and went into the fields,
where he incamped himselfe, and so set forwards to doo some seruice vpon the
enimie, hauing then in his companie six hundred footmen vnder the ensigns of sir
William Stanleie, capteine George Carew, capteine Fisher, capteine Furse, capteine
<note place="marg">The gouernor remoueth from Limerike to Connilo.</note>
Piers, &amp; capteine Hind; and he himselfe and capteine Apeslie reserued one hundred
horssemen betweene them. Now being aduertised that a great companie of the
rebels were incamped in Connilo vnder their capteine Iohn of Desmond, he marched
towards them. And being come n&eacute;ere to an abbeie or monasterie called Monaster
Neuagh, seuen miles from Limerike, there appeared a great companie in a plaine
field both of horssemen and footmen, in estimation two thousand or there abouts,
marching in battell araie, and had cast out their wings of shot, and placed eueric
thing verie well and orderlie.</p>
<p>When the gouernor perceiued and beheld this, being verie glad that some p&eacute;ece
of seruice was towards, he likewise conferreth with his capteins, and by their aduises
setteth his companie in like good order, and brought them into a quadrant proportion,
<note place="marg">The gouernor marcheth to incounter with Iohn of Desmond.</note>
setting out his flankers in seuerall places according to the seruices, &amp;
appointed yerie good leaders for the same: but his cariages he placed in the rereward,
with shot sufficient for their safegard. Now when all things were thus ordered,
he marched forwards to the enimies. Iohn of Desmond, when he saw that he must
fight or flie, and that brags would not beare out the matter, by the councell of doctor
Allen, who had the holie ghost at commandement, to giue them the victorie, caused
the popes banner to be displaied, and then marching forwards in verie good order,
<note place="marg">The popes banner displaied.</note>
hee tooke a plaine ditch in the open field: and minding to abide the fight, disposeth
his horssemen, footmen, Galowglasses, and his shot for his best strength and aduantage.</p>
<p>The
gouernor setteth onwards, &amp; giueth the onset vpon them with his shot, who
<note place="marg">The battell betw&eacute;ene the gouernor and sir Iohn of Desmond.</note>
valiantlie resisted the first &amp; second vol&eacute;es, &amp; answered the fight verie well, euen to
the couching of the pikes, that the matter stood verie doubtfull. But the Englishmen
so fiercelie &amp; desperatlie set vpon them afresh with the third vol&eacute;e, that they were
discomfited and had the ouerthrow giuen them, and fled. Iohn of Desmond, as a
<note place="marg">The Irish lost the field.</note>
woorthie Xerxes, who (as the historiographers write of him) was <emph>Primus in fuga, postremus
in bello,</emph> sat vpon his horsse all this while and gaue the looking: who soeuer
turned first, he was the first that was gone: for he put spur to the horsse &amp; fled awaie
as fast as he could, shewing a faire paire of h&eacute;eles, which was better to him than two
paire of hands. In this fight were manie slaine, of which doctor Allen was one, and
<note place="marg">Doctor Allen is slaine.</note>
three score others of good account. And in the chase, there were slaine and
hurt, which died shortlie after, about two hundred men. This doctor Allen
was an Irish man borne, and the chiefest cause of this fight. For he trusting
to the Spaniards, whom he knew to be verie skilfull, and also dreaming the victorie
<note place="marg">Doctor Allen incouraged the campe to fight.</note>
by his inchantments to be at his commandement, incouraged Iohn of Desmond forwards:
and in the campe in the waie of good sp&eacute;ed would n&eacute;eds saie masse, and as
the prophets of Baal in the time of king Achab, he offered to his God Mazim, and
cried out for his aid, but none would come; for his God was asl&eacute;epe and could not
heare. Notwithstanding, he stood so much vpon the credit of his offrings and sacrifices,
that he assured them of a victorie, and that he himselfe would be the first that
should that daie giue the first blow; but whether he so did or not, there was he
slaine: where he had the iust reward of a traitor, who most wickedlie and disloiallie
forsooke the dutie and allegiance, which by the word of God he did owe vnto hir
highnesse, and deuoted himselfe a professed Iesuit to the Romish antichrist, and an

open traitor vnto his lawfull prince. The earle of Desmond himselfe was not present
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond was in view of the fight.</note>
in this fight, but he and the dissembling baron of Lexnew stood in the view &amp; sight
of it, vpon a little hill in a wood about a quarter of a mile from thense: but the
whole companies were there, and had part of the breakefast.</p>
<p>This baron of Lexnews eldest sonne, named Patrike, was seruant to hir maiestie
and sworne, and serued in the court; but had leaue of hir maiestie to come into Ireland
<note place="marg">The baron of Lexnews son, seruant to the qu&eacute;ene and sworne, beareth armes against hir.</note>
to see his father: but he was no sooner come, and entred into his fathers
house and home, but he forsooke his faith and oth to hir highnesse, and became
a wicked rebell, and most traitorouslie bare armes against hir, and so continued a
ranke traitor to the verie end. Wherein appeareth the nature of himselfe, and of the
brood of that cursed generation, among whome there is neither faith, nor truth. And
<note place="marg">No faith nor regard of an oth among the Irishrie.</note>
therefore they maie be verie well resembled to an ape, which (as the common proucrbe
is) an ape is but an ape, albeit he be clothed in purple and veluet: euen so this wicked
impe. For notwithstanding he was trained vp in the court of England, sworne seruant
vnto hir maiestie, in good fauour and countenance in the court, and apparelled
according to his degr&eacute;e, and dailie nurtured and brought vp in all ciuilitie: he was
no sooner come home, but awaie with his English attires, and on with his brogs, his
shirt, and other Irish rags, being became as verie a traitor as the veriest knaue of
them all, &amp; so for the most part they are all, as dailie experience teacheth, dissemble
they neuer so much to the contrarie. For like as Iupiters cat, let hir be transformed
<note place="marg">Iupiters cat.</note>
to neuer so faire a ladie, and let hir be neuer so well attired and accompanied
with the best ladies, let hir be neuer so well est&eacute;emed and honored: yet if the
mouse come once in hir sight, she will be a cat and shew hir kind: but to the historie.</p>
<p>When the battell was ended, &amp; the retreat sounded, the gouernor incamped
himselfe fast by the riuer side of the monasterie aforesaid, and there laie that
night. About midnight, when all things were quiet, &amp; euerie man was at
his rest: euen then the often named earle of Desmond sendeth a messenger
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmonds dissembling, &amp; his counsell.</note>
with letters of congratulation vnto the gouernor, bearing him in hand that
he was verie glad and ioifull of his good successe and victorie and like an hypocrite
pretending verie good will to hir maiestie, gaue him aduise that for the
auoiding of hir great charges, he should dislodge himselfe from that place; which
as he thought was not best for an armie to lie in. The gouernor answered his
letters with the like, and requested him to come vnto him, that they might haue
conference togither, and ioine in this hir maiesties seruice, and wherein he would be
glad to follow his aduise in anie thing that might further hir highnesse seruice: but
to withdraw himselfe and his companie from thense, vnlesse he could giue him a good
reason, he would not y&eacute;eld to his motion, nor take his warrant for anie warrantise.
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond sheweth himselfe to be an open rebell.</note>
And therefore he remained thensefoorth in the same place thr&eacute;e or foure daies,
expecting still the earles comming: but he so little meant anie such thing, that
henseforth he became a rebell in open action, and in armes against the gouernor,
finding nothing in the earle but dissembling, and to vse delaies and faire
sp&eacute;eches to gaine time to serue his turne, remoued from thense to a towne of the
earles named Rekell, and there incamped himselfe. They were no sooner settled, but
<note place="marg">The gouernor remoueth to Rekell.</note>
the scoutmaister, hauing beene abroad, declareth to the gouernor that he had discouered
a great companie of horssemen and footmen which were within a mile of the

to the direction of the gouernor issued out, &amp; met with the enimies, and skirmished
with them, of whom they killed manie, and tooke some prisoners.</p>
<p>These men, being examined, declared that the earle was now in the fields and in
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond in open rebellion.</note>
armes, and so had beene euer since the last ouerthrow of his brother Iohn of Desmond;

and euerie man tooke his rest. But the earle and his brother minding to doo
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond secretlie in the night stealeth to the gouernors campe to intrap it.</note>
some mischiefe, they watched, and in the dead of the night then following, taking aduantage
of the time, when men were wearie and in their sl&eacute;epes, came with all their
companies, and meant to haue set vpon the whole campe. But they came too short
and missed of their purpose: for the campe was too well warded for them to take
anie aduantage. The gouernor considering the intent of the enimies was to doo
what they could to remoue him from that place, which could not be kept but to
the great damage of the enimies sundrie waies, and that the same was a verie
<note place="marg">A garison placed at Rekell.</note>
necessarie place for a garison and a ward, whereby to stop the continuall intercourse
of the enimies, which by the means of a bridge ouer that water, they had a continuall
recourse to &amp; fro that waie: he before his departure from thense did plant &amp;
place a ward in the castell adioining to the bridge, which did from that time annoie
the enimies verie much: and then from hense he marched towards the earles house
of Asketten, and by the waie he met with sundrie of the earles companie, and skirmished
and fought with them to the losse of manie of them.</p>
<p>This house of Asketten is a verie strong castell, standing vpon a rocke in the verie
<note place="marg">Asketten the earle of Desmonds chiefest house.</note>
midst of the riuer, and the chiefest house of the earles, wherein he had a strong
ward: but he himselfe at this present time and his brother Iohn were assembled
vpon a little hill on the further side of the riuer, standing there vpon their whole
force. The gouernor hoping of some good seruice towards, drew all his companie
into the abbeie house of Asketten, not far from the castell house; and there conferring
with the capteins what were best to be doone, it was agr&eacute;ed and thought
good, that a letter or two more should be written to the earle, and to persuade
<note place="marg">A letter sent to the earle of Desmond to persuade him to submission.</note>
him to submission. The gouernor, who was a verie good secretarie, and could
pen a letter verie excellentlie well, did draw a letter, vsing manie good words,
termes, and reasons to persuade him to conformitie and obedience to hir
maiestie: &amp; that he should not be the occasion of the vtter tall &amp; end of so
noble a house, which descended from Roestus the great prince of South-wales by
his mother Nesta, daughter vnto the said Roesius, as Giraldus one of the same familie
<note place="marg">The house of Desmond.</note>
writeth. And herewith by the waie of a parenthesis, it dooth not appeare by anie
sufficient authoritie, vnlesse a sonet and a deuise of a noble man be a sufficient authoritie,
that the Giraldines came out of Italie; but perhaps out of Normandie: and
the first of them placed in England had some interteinement and liuing at Windesor,
and thereof was called Giraldus de Windesora: and he gaue not the armes of
Richard Strangbow earle of Chepstow, as some haue written: but as he was a gentleman
of himselfe, gaue the armes incident to his owne house, which is argent a salter
gules.</p>
<p>For certeine it is, he was and is a verie ancient gentleman, whose ancestors were
planted and placed in that land by king Henrie the second, and haue euer since continued
in this land in much honor, wishing, aduising, and persuading, that if there were
anie feare of God, obedience to the prince, or regard of himselfe, and of his name and
familie; that he would reclaime himselfe vnto dutie and obedience: and that the
honor of his ancestors might not be buried in his treacheries and follies. These
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond will not be persuaded.</note>
letters being well penned were sent vnto him. But notwithstanding the most pithie,
true, and effectuall reasons and arguments were sufficient to haue persuaded anie honest
or reasonable man: yet was his Pharaos heart so hardened and indurated in
disobedience, rebellion, and treacherie, that nothing could make him to y&eacute;eld and
relent: but leauing his former and woonted dissimulations, returneth the messenger
with a flat deniall that he will not yeeld anie further obedience to hir highnesse.
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond fortifieth his castels.</note>
And foorthwith to confirme the same, he fortifieth his strongest and best houses and

uernor, vpon the receipt of the earles answer, and minding to frame his seruice accordinglie;
news was brought him that sir William Drurie lord iustice was dead,
who deceassed at Waterford vpon the third of October 1579, which was a dolefull
<note place="marg">Sir William Drurie dieth.</note>
hearing to all good Englishmen, and a great hinderance vnto hir highnesse
seruice.</p>
<p>This sir William Drurie was verie valiant, wise, and a gentleman of great experience,
<note place="marg">The conditions and manners of sir William Drurie.</note>
descended of a verie ancient and a worshipfull house, being a yoonger brother,
but the birthright excepted, nothing inferior to his elder brother anie kind of waie
in the gifts of wisedome, valiantnesse, knowledge, and experience of matters politike
or martiall. In his youth he was a page, and serued in the court; and as in
yeares, so in knowledge of all courtlie seruices he did grow and increase, and became
to be as gallant a courtier as none lightlie excelled him. He was verie deuout,
and a follower vnto the then lord Russell lord priuie scale, and after earle of Bedford,
who gaue him good countenance and interteinment: for vnder him he serued in
France at Muttrell and Bullongnois, and after the warres ended, he went to Calis, and
<note place="marg">His seruice at Bullongne.</note>
oftentimes being there he issued out, and did manie good seruices about Cambraie and
in Artois: and in the end about Bruxelles he was taken prisoner. Not long after he
<note place="marg">He is taken prisoner.</note>
was red&eacute;emed and ransomed, and then he would n&eacute;eds serue at the seas, and hauing
gotten a ship well appointed for the purpose, he aduentureth that seruice. The
<note place="marg">He serueth at seas.</note>
beginning of it was so hard, that in nine daies he was in a continuall storme, and
in great despaire for euer to recouer: neuerthelesse, whom the sword could not make
afraid, the seas could not dismaie; but was euer one and the same man, of a good
mind and great corage: and the storme being past, he followed the seruice which
he had taken in hand, and became to be an excellent maritimall man, and verie expert
in all seruices at the seas. When the time of this his seruice was expired, he
returned into England; &amp; attending vpon the earle of Bedford, he accompanied him
in the seruice against the rebels of Deuon, at the commotion or rebellion in the third
<note place="marg">His seruice at the commotion in Deuon.</note>
yeare of the reigne of king Edward the sixt one thousand fiue hundred fortie and
nine, and did there verie good seruice. After which in course of time, he went to
serue at Berwike, where his valor and behauior was such, that he was made prouost
<note place="marg">His seruice at Berwike.</note>

<note place="marg">He is prouost marshall.</note>

<note place="marg">He is dubbed knight.</note>
marshall vnder the earle of Sussex being lord lieutenant, and for his sundrie notable
good seruices he rewarded him with the degr&eacute;e of knighthood.</p>
<p>Not long after that, there was a p&eacute;ece of necessarie seruice to be doone in Scotland
by the said earle vpon the qu&eacute;enes commandement; but he was verie sicke,
and at that time he could not performe the same: wherfore he deputed in his
place this worthie knight, whome he then made generall of the armie: and
<note place="marg">He is generall of the armie, and dooeth a good p&eacute;ece of seruice in Scotland.</note>
with such forces as were thought m&eacute;et he entreth into the seruices appointed vnto
him, being accompanied with the earle of Lennox, sir Thomas Manners, sir George
Carie, and sir Robert Constable, with sundrie other capteins, to the number of twelue
hundred footmen. And his commission being to serue at Edenborough, which then
by the reason of the diuision among the noblemen, about the murthering of the earle
of Murreie, he tooke, spoiled, and burned sundrie forts and castels: and in the end besieged
and tooke the towne and castell of Edenborough, and deliuered the same, according

shall haue sufficient matter and occasion to vse both the sword &amp; the law, iudgement
and mercie. And hauing receiued hir highnes commandement in this behalfe, he
maketh his voiage &amp; repaire into Ireland: &amp; being now settled in his roome
and office by the right honorable sir Henrie Sidneie lord deputie, he acquiteth himselfe
verie well euerie waie, being as seuere a iudge and earnest persecutor of the
wicked and rebellious, as a zealous defender of the dutifull and obedient, to the
great good liking of hir maiestie, the terror of the wicked, the comfort of the good,
and the benefit of the commonwealth. After some time of his triall in this office, and
sir Henrie Sidneie lord deputie being reuoked into England, he who had serued well
<note place="marg">Sir William Drurie is made lord iustice of all Ireland.</note>
in part, is called now to serue in all: and from a particular president is called to be
a generall gouernor: and is in place of the departed deputie made lord iustice. He
was no sooner entred into the office, but forthwith the rebellion and warres of the
<note place="marg">The rebellion of the Desmonds in Mounster.</note>
Desmonds began in Mounster vnder Iames Fitzmoris, and the Italians latelie come
from the pope, and vnder the earle of Desmond and his brethren, who had long
breathed and looked for this time. For the pacifieng, or rather subduing of this
wicked rebellion, he tooke such continuall trauels and troubles, &amp; so brused his
bodie, that being not able to hold out any longer, he fell sicke &amp; died (as is beforesaid)
<note place="marg">The death of sir William Drurie.</note>
in the citie of Waterford, and from thense his corps was remooued to Dublin,
and there buried: his bodie resting in peace, his soule in euerlasting blisse, and his
fame in this world for euer immortall.</p>
<p>Sir Nicholas Malbie, who was ch&eacute;efe gouernor of Mounster, now that his commission
by the death of sir William Drurie was expired and ended, gaue ouer to follow
<note place="marg">The campe is dissolued and dispersed into garrisons.</note>
anie actuall warres or ciuill administration in Mounster; but remooued himselfe
and the whole campe vnto Lougher, and there dispersed them abrode in townes and
villages to lie in garrison, and vpon their owne gards, vntill it were knowne who
should haue the sword, and be the principall officer. Amongest the capteins thus
dispersed into seuerall places, sir William Stanleie, and capteine George Carew were
assigned to lie at Adare. The traitors &amp; rebels, hearing of the death of the worthie

knight of whose prowesse and valiantnesse by the sword, &amp; of whose wisedome &amp; vprightnes
in gouernement, they had good triall; yet not abiding to be alienated from
their old leauened and wicked vsage, they were not a little glad that he was dead,
euen as the other were most sorowfull for the losse &amp; lacke of him. Wherefore now
they pull vp their spirits, &amp; confer togither how they may in this inter-reigne win the
spurs, and be vtterlie deliuered from the English gouernement. Wherefore it is agreed
among them, that vpon euerie seuerall garrison of the most principall capteins, they
<note place="marg">The garrisons are besieged and inuironed by the Irishrie.</note>
would seuerall companies to watch &amp; keepe them in their holds, that they should
not issue out, but to their perill. Some therefore are appointed at Kilmalocke, some
at Carigofoile, some at Asketteh, and some at one place, and some at another. And
at Adare, where these two gentlemen sir William Stanleie &amp; George Carew laie, sir
Iames of Desmond brother to the earle with foure hundred Kerns and fiftie horsses
<note place="marg">Sir Iames of Desmond besiegeth Adare.</note>
was appointed to serue and watch; which he did so carefullie &amp; narowlie, that
none durst to peepe nor looke out but in danger of some perill. But when vittels
waxed short within doores, the souldiors, who could nor would be pined, gaue the
aduenture to fetch that which was without doores: and as want of vittels did increase,
so did their issuings out vpon the enimies grow and increase. And so often were
their sallies and incountrings with the enimies, that in the end they finding &amp; feeling
<note place="marg">The Irishmen leaue to inuiron the garrison.</note>
the courage of the Englishmen, they had alwaies the worst side; and at euerie bickering
euer lost some of their companie. Wherevpon they raised their siege, gaue place
to the garrisons, and returned to the earle of Desmond. For albeit as yet they
wanted a generall gouernor to rule aboue all, yet the captens were not to s&eacute;eke, nor
yet failed to doo the seruice which vnto them did apperteine, either for seruice or

safetie. And among all the rest sir William Stanleie and capteine George Carew
(as is before said) lieng in garrison at Adare, and vpon an occasion minding to doo a
peece of seruice, verie earlie, and before the breake of the daie, they tooke a bote
<note place="marg">The knight of the valleie his countrie spoiled.</note>
or a cote trough, which could not hold aboue eight or ten persons at a time, and
passed ouer their soldiors vnto the other side of the riuer, which lieth betw&eacute;ene Adare
and the Kerrie, minding to haue burned &amp; wasted all the lands and countrie belonging
&amp; apperteining to the knight of the valleie, who then was in actuall rebellion
<note place="marg">The knight of the valleie a rebell.</note>
against hir maiestie, with the earle of Desmond and his brethren, where they then
laie at a castell named Balliloghan, the chiefest &amp; strongest place which the enimie
had in that place and countrie, and this was furnished with a strong ward of the
Spaniards. After that these two capteins had burned and spoiled the countrie, and
put to the sword whomsoeuer they thought good: in their returne before they could
recouer the riuer, sir Iames of Desmond, the knight of the valleie, and the foresaid
<note place="marg">Sir William Stanleie and capteine George Carews seruice at Adare.</note>
Spaniards with all their forces, to the number of foure hundred footmen and thirtie
horssemen, gaue the charge vpon these two ensigues verie fiercelie, they hauing not in
their companie aboue six score persons to the vttermost. These two capteins answered
the charge, and most valiantly skirmished with them at the push of the
pike without intermission aboue eight hours, and killed of them aboue fiftie shot and
Kernes; and sir Iames himselfe with others gr&eacute;euouslie hurt and wounded, without the
losse of anie one of their owne men, sauing sundrie were shrewdlie hurt and wounded.
At length these two capteins recouered their bote, and caused all the souldiors to
be transported; they themselues being the verie last that passed ouer, and the enimies
doubting of the safetie, stood afterwards vpon a better force.</p>
<p>The lords of the councell at Dublin in the meane time, considering the distressed
state of the whole land for want of a principall officer, did assemble themselues, and
tooke aduise for the choise of some one wise man, m&eacute;et and fit for the gouernement.
<note place="marg">Sir William Pelham chosen to be lord Iustice.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1579</date></note>
And in the end they resolued vpon sir William Pelham, whom they chose to be lord
iustice. And vpon sundaie being the eleuenth of October 1579, he receiued the sword
and tooke his oth in Christs church of Dublin: there being present the lord chancellor,
the archbishop of Dublin, the earles of Ormond and Kildare, and the whole councell:
besides a great number of barons, knights, and gentlemen. The sermon being
euded, he returned to the castell, before whome sir Nicholas Bagnoll knight, marshall

did attend him: being come to the castell, he was receiued with the shot of all the
great artillerie. As soone as he was entered into the chamber of presence, and the

sword there deliuered, he called the lord chancellor before him: and in consideration
of his good seruices in causes of councell, and of hir maiesties good acceptation of the
same, be rewarded &amp; honoured him with the degr&eacute;e of knighthood, by the name of
sir William Gerard.</p>
<p>Likewise, he called Edward Fitton the sonne and heire of sir Edward Fitton, late
treasuror of Ireland, and dubbed him knight. After diuner the counsell sat, consulting
vpon causes of the estate: and for quieting of the realme, letters were sent
vnto all the noblemen and gentlemen of anie countenance and calling, persuading
them to the continuance of their loialties and dutifull obedience. And for the gouernement
of the prouince of Mounster, in absence of the lord iustice, a patent was sealed
and deliuered to the earle of Ormond: who hauing the keeping and custodie of the

<note place="marg">The lord chancellor sent into England.</note>
that the lord chancellor should passe ouer into England, with letters of aduertisement

lordships iournie towards against the rebels: who had also in commission to vtter
by speech what was to be aduertised &amp; answered vpon hir maiesties demands and
councels. When all things were prepared for his iournie, he appointed the erle of
Kildare to defend the borders northward, and his lordship marched southward toward
Mounster, taking with him the three bands latelie come from Berwike, vnder the
leading of capteine Walker, capteine Case, and capteine Pikeman: with so manie
others as he thought m&eacute;et and necessarie for that seruice. And when he came in
his waie to Kilkenuie, being the nineteenth of October, there he remained two daies
<note place="marg">The lord iustice keepeth sessions at Kilkennie.</note>
and kept sessions, whereat he sat in person, and determined manie matters, and did
cause Edmund Mac Neile a notable traitor, &amp; sundrie other malefactors, to be executed
to death: and also he made a peace and reconciliation betw&eacute;ene the earle of
Ormond and sir Barnabie Fitzpatrike, baron of vpper Ossorie: betwixt whome was
<note place="marg">The earle of Ormond and the baron of vpper Osserie reconciled and made frends.</note>
a mortall hatred. And bonds were taken betw&eacute;ene them for restoring ech one to
the other the preies, which either of their men had taken. During his abode and being
in Kilkennie, the earle gaue his lordship verie honourable and good interteinment.</p>
<p>From this towne he departed the two and twentith of October, and by iournies he
came to Cashell, where the earle of Ormond with a band of two hundred and thirtie
men came and met him. And here the lord iustice sent his letters of the foure and
twentith of October to the earle of Desmond, for his repaire vnto him, for the appeasing
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond is sent for to come to the lord iustice.</note>
of the quarrell and controuersie betw&eacute;ene him &amp; sir Nicholas Malbie, referring
vnto him to come either to Cashell or to Limerike. And from this towne he
rode to Limerike, and about a mile before he came to the citie, sir Nicholas Malbie
and sundrie other capteins &amp; gentlemen met his lordship; and for his welcome gaue
him a braue vol&eacute;e of shot: and so brought him to the citie, where the maior in all
dutifull maner receiued him, and presented him with a thousand well weaponed and
<note place="marg">The lord iustice honorablie receiued into Limerike.</note>
appointed men of the same citie. The next daie he departed thense, and went to a
towne name Fanings, where sir Nicholas Malbie presented vnto his lordship a letter,
which he receiued from Vlike Burke: the same being the letter of doctor Sanders
sent vnto the said Vlike, and with most pestilent reasons persuaded him to rebellion.

<p>The earle of Ormond, according to the order, went to the said Desmond, and deliuered
vnto him both the letters and the said articles, and required his resolution
and answer. Which when he had ouer read and considered, he returned his answer
<note place="marg">The earle sendeth letters but commeth not.</note>
by a letter dated at Crogh the thirtith of October 1579, vsing therein nothing but
triflings and delaies, requiring restitution for old wrongs and iniuries, and iustifieng
himselfe to be a good subiect, though he doo not yeeld to the foresaid articles. During
the time of this parl&eacute;e, the lord iustice was remooued to Crome, where he
expected the returne of the erle of Ormond, and to that place sir William Stanleie
&amp; capteine George Carew came vnto his lordship with their two hundred footmen.</p>

<p>The earle of Ormond being returned, &amp; hauing little preuailed with Desmond,
notwithstanding his sundrie persuasions, there were other letters sent vnto him to induce
<note place="marg">The second letter sent to the earle of Desmond for his comming in.</note>
him to the consideration of himselfe and his estate: but when no reason, no persuasion,
nor counsell could preuaile; then it was thought good by the lord iustice &amp;
councell to proc&eacute;ed to their former determination, and to proclame him a traitor.
The lord iustice remooued from Crome to Rathkill, and he was no sooner incamped,
but alarum by the traitors was raised: which was answered foorthwith by the lord
iustice and the earle of Ormond: &amp; in that skirmish thr&eacute;e or foure of the traitors
were slaine, of which the earle of Desmonds butler was one, the earle himselfe being

then by the generall consent of the nobilitie, the councell, gentlemen, and the whole

in the highest degr&eacute;e of treason at Rathkill the second of Nouember 1579. The

consumed with fire, and nothing was spared which fire &amp; sword could consume.

footmen, of the which companie George Bourchier went to Kilmallocke, and sir William
Stanleie and capteine George Carew to Adare. And then he remooued and
tooke his iournie vnto Limerike, being accompanied with the earle of Ormond, who
the next daie left the lord iustice and returned to his charge. After which departure
of the lord iustice, the proclamed traitor of Desmond and his brothers, not able anie
longer to shrowd his treacheries, went with all his forces to the towne of Youghall,
<note place="marg">The towne of Youghall taken &amp; spoiled.</note>
where against his comming the gates of the towne were shut, but yet it was thought
but colourablie: for verie shortlie after, without deniall or resistance, the earle and
all his troope of rebels entered the towne and tooke it, and there remained about fioe
daies, rifling and carrieng awaie the goods and houshold stuffe to the castell of Strangicallie
and Lefinnen, the which then were kept by the Spaniards.</p>
<p>The earle of Ormond, assoone as he was aduertised hereof, he caused a barke well
<note place="marg">A barke well appointed at Waterford is sent to Youghall.</note>
appointed to be dispatched from Waterford, &amp; to come to Youghall: the capteine of
which bark was named White, a man of that countrie birth, verie valiant and of a
stout stomach. Assoone as he was come to the wals of the towne, and had anchored
his ship, he recouered from the rebels certeine ordinances of the said townes;
<note place="marg">The ordinances recouered from the rebels.</note>
and being put to vnderstand that the seneshall of Imokellie was comming towards
the towne, he set all his men on land; and setting his men in good order, he entered
into the towne at the watergate, and marched in good order through the towne, till
he came where the rebels were togither, and then more rashlie than consideratlie,
gaue the charge and onset vpon them: but the number of them being great, and
his but a handfull to them, he was in verie short time inclosed and ouerlaied, and
<note place="marg">White, capteine of the barke is slain.</note>
there slaine, and with much adoo did a few of his companie recouer their ship againe.
The lord generall and gouernour in the meane time, not slacking his businesse, did assemble
and muster all his companie, &amp; being accompanied with sir George Bourchier, sir
<note place="marg">The earle of Ormond maketh a rode into Connilo, and killeth a number of the rebels.</note>
William Stanleie, capteine Dowdall, capteine Furse, and others, made a iourneie into
Connilo, which was then the ch&eacute;efest place of trust that the earle had, both for safetie and
strength, and for vittels and forage, and there his greatestforce and strength of his souldiors
were seized in the townes and villages. And they then little thinking and lesse
looking for anie such ghests, were vnawares and vpon a sudden intrapped and taken
napping, and the most part of them taken and slaine, and the villages for the most part
burned and spoiled. The earle of Desmond at this present time was there, but not
knowne in his castell called the New castell, and escaped verie narrowlie. This p&eacute;ece
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond in danger to be taken.</note>
of seruice being doone, the lord gouernour marched towards Mac Willies countrie, and
being to go through a certeine passe, he met with the seneshall, vpon whome he
gaue the charge, who answered the same verie valiantlie, and the skirmish was verie
hot, in which the seneshals brothers and sundrie of his men were slaine; and the
like also befell vpon the lord gouernours men, though not so manie, amongest whome
capteine Zouches trumpetor was one; which so grecued the lord generall, that he
commanded all the houses, townes, and villages in that countrie and about Lefinnen,
which in anie waie did belong to the earle of Desmond, or of anie of his fr&eacute;ends
and followers, to be burned and spoiled.</p>
<p>From this he tooke his iourneie towards Corke, and in his waie at Drunfening he
tooke a preie of one thousand fiue hundred kine or cowes, which were all driuen
and sent vnto Corke, at which citie assoone as his lordship was come, and had rested
a small time, then by the aduise of the capteins he diuided and bestowed his companie
into sundrie garrisons and places conuenient, as which might best answer
the seruices. And his lordship being accompanied with capteine Dowdall and capteine
Furse, he went to Cashell, and by the waie he tooke the maior of Youghall,
whome foorthwith he examined, and for his treasons and treacheries, in that he
would y&eacute;eld vp the towne vnto Desmond, and had before refused a band of English

men, which was appointed to lie in garrison in that towne, for the defense thereof, and
had promised that he would k&eacute;epe and defend the same against all men; he carried
him along with him vnto Youghall, and there before his owne doore hanged him.
<note place="marg">The maior of Youghall hanged before his owne dores.</note>
The lord gouernour when he came into the towne, found it all desolate, rifled and
spoiled, and no one man, woman or child therein, sauing one frier, whome he
spared, bicause he had fetched the corps of Henrie Dauels from Traleigh, and had
caried it to Waterford, where it was buried in the chancell of the cathedrall church.
And his lordship much pitieng the desolate estate of the towne, did take order for
<note place="marg">The towne of Youghall all desolate.</note>
the reedifieng of the wals and gates, and placed therein a garrison of thr&eacute;e hundred
footmen vnder capteine Morgan and capteine Piers, who did verie good seruice in
<note place="marg">The inhabitants reuoked to dwell and inhabit the towne.</note>
the countrie, and by good means drew home the people and old inhabitants, and impeopled
the towne againe. And the lord gouernour departed thense, and followed
his seruice, as time, place, and opportunitie did serue; and taking aduise with the
capteins for some speciall seruice, and remembring that the Spaniards had hitherto
lien in rest and quietnesse, in garrison at Strangicallie, and hitherto nothing doone
or said vnto them; it was agr&eacute;ed betw&eacute;ene his lordship and the capteins, to doo some
seruice vpon them, and to trie their value; wherevpon they marched thither and laid
siege thervnto.</p>
<p>The Spaniards, who kept alwaies good watch, and had also verie good espials
abrode, they were foorthwith aduertised that a companie of souldiers were drawing
<note place="marg">The Spaniards lieng in Strangicallie forsake their fort and in fl&eacute;eing are slaine.</note>
and marching towards the said castell, and when they themselues saw it to be true,
and had discouered them, they began to distrust themselves, and to doubt of their
abilitie how to withstand them. Wherefore abandoning &amp; forsaking the castell, they
passed ouer the water, thinking to recouer the woods and so to escape that present danger.
But sir William Stanleie, capteine Zouch, capteine Dowdall, capteine Piers, capteine
Roberts, and all their companies did so egerlie follow and pursue them, that in the
end they ouertooke them, and slue all or the most part of them, and so tooke the
castell, wherein the lord gouernour placed a ward. Likewise when he laie at Adare,
and vnderstanding that the erle of Desmond was abrode, the garrison minding to
doo some seruice vpon him, they issued out. Whereof he hauing some intelligence,
notwithstanding his companie was but small in comparison of the others: yet he
laie in an ambush to m&eacute;et them in their returne; and vpon an aduantage he gaue the
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond lieth in an ambush.</note>
onset vpon them, and gaue a verie hot charge, in which the souldiers of the garrison
were so hardlie assailed, that they brake the most part of their pikes, and were
inforced with their swords and with the stumps of their staues to stand to their de
fenses; which they did so valiantlie, that the earle in the end with the losse of his
men was driuen to giue ouer and to fl&eacute;e.</p>
<p>The like seruice did sir Henrie Wallop, who then laie at Limerike, sir George
Bourchier, capteine Dowdall, capteine Holingworth, and all the residue of the capteins
in their seuerall charges and garrisons, who though of themselues they were
verie forward; yet the lord gouernour neuer slept his time, but was alwaies in readinesse,
<note place="marg">The diligent seruice of the earle of Ormond.</note>
being the first with the formost, and the last with the hindermost. In the
moneth of August 1580, he remooued and dislodged himselfe from Adare, and
marched to Boteuant a house of the lord Barries, where a p&eacute;ece of seruice was appointed
them to be doone: but suddenlie such a sicknes came among the soldiers
<note place="marg">A sicknesse in the campe.</note>
which tooke them in the head, that at one instant there were aboue thr&eacute;e hundred
of them sicke, and for three daies they laie as dead stockes, looking still when they
should die, but yet such was the good will of God, that few died; for they all recouered.
This sickenesse not long after came into England, &amp; was called the gentle
correction. Now the companie being thus recouered, his lordship minding to follow
a p&eacute;ece of seruice, diuideth his companie into two parts, the one he tooke himselfe,

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"and"</fw>-->


<pb n="427"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"427"</fw>-->


and tooke the waie by the Iland; &amp; the other he appointed to go directlie vnto
Traligh, and there they met and diuided their companies into thr&eacute;e parts, &amp; so
marched to Dingle a cush. And as they went they draue the whole countrie before
them vnto the Ventrie, &amp; by that means they preied and tooke all the cattell
<note place="marg">All the countrie is preied.</note>
in the countrie to the number of eight thousand kine, besides horsses, garrons,
sh&eacute;epe, and gotes, and all such people as they met they did without mercie put to
the sword. By these meanes the whole countrie hauing no cattel nor kine left,
they were driuen to such extremities, that for want of vittels they were either to die
and perish for famine, or to die vnder the sword. Neuerthelesse, manie of them
vnderstanding that sir William Winter viceadmerall of England was newlie arriued
with the qu&eacute;enes ships at the Ventrie, and that he had receiued a commission
<note place="marg">Sir William Winter giueth protections.</note>
to vse marshall law, they made their repaire vnto him, and obteined protections vnder
him. Which the souldiers did verie much mislike, the same to be somewhat
preiudiciall to hir maiesties seruice: bicause they persuaded themselues, that if they
had folowed the course which they began, they should either haue taken or slaine
them all.</p>
<p>Sir William, viceadmerall of England, vpon the newes reported to hir maiestie
<note place="marg">Sir William Winter k&eacute;epeth the seas.</note>
that a new supplie was prepared to come into Ireland from out of Spaine, was commanded
to k&eacute;epe the seas and to attend their comming, and as occasion serued to
doo his best seruice vpon them. Who when he had so done certeine moneths, his
vittels waxed scant; and s&eacute;eing no such matter, and also that the winter was drawing
onwards, thinking nothing lesse than that the Spaniards would so late in the
yeare arriue thither, he hoised his sailes and returned into England. But he was
mistaken &amp; deceiued: for not long after they came and landed at Smerw&eacute;eke, as
hereafter shall be at full declared. And now leauing the soldiers in their garrisons, let
vs returne to the lord iustice, who when he departed from Limerike the fift of Nouember

where the earle and his sonne with two bad horssemen met his lordship: and from
thense he trauelled by iournies vnto Gallewaie, where he was verie honorablie receiued.
And to the end to incourage them to persist and continue in dutifull obedience,
he confirmed vnto the corporation certeine branches and articles, wherof

out of England, and accompanied with certeine gentlemen, met him with a hundred
and fiftie horssemen, well furnished and well horssed with English geldings, euerie
man wearing a red cote with a yellow lace, who attended his lordship into the citie,
and from thense he was assigned and sent vnto the Newrie, where he died verie
shortlie after vpon the fiue and twentith of December 1579. His hart was consumed,
<note place="marg">Capteine Noris sent to lie at the Newrie.</note>
his splene corrupted, and his braine mixt with filthie matter. His bands were
diuided and deliuered to either capteins. And immediatlie vpon his entrance into

commanded as prisoner to k&eacute;epe his chamber for his contempt, bicause he did not attend
the lord iustice into Mounster as he was commanded; but vpon his submission
after foure daies he was released. And vpon the death of Francis Agard esquier, sir

Henrie Harington, who had married one of his daughters and heires, was by vertue of

teine Piers, issued out of the citie with their foure bands, and neere to the shore in
the view of his lordship, they presented him with a iollie skirmish, and so retired
themselues, to make ward against his landing. The bulworks, gates, and curteins
of the citie were beautified with eusignes and shot in warlike maner, and then all
the shot of the ships in the hauen, and a great ranke of chambers vpon the keie,
togither with the shot of the souldiers, were discharged, and gaue his lordship a
lustie and a great thundering peale.</p>
<p>At his landing the maior and aldermen araied in their scarlet gownes met him,
<note place="marg">The lord iustice receiued honourabliein to Waterford.</note>
and presented vnto his lordship the sword and the keies of the gates, which foorthwith
he redeliuered vnto them againe, and the sword the maior bare and caried before
his lordship. He went first to the church, and by the waie vpon two seuerall
stages made for the purpose, there were two orations made vnto him in Latine; and
at his returne from the church, he had the third in English at the doore of his lodging.
And to this citie the earle of Ormond came vnto him, and they being togither,
letters were sent from sir William Morgan of aduertisement, that the traitors
were come downe about Dungaruon and Yoghall. Whervpon one hundred
horssemen vnder capteine Zouch, and Sentleger, and foure hundred footmen vnder
sir William Stanleie, sir Peter Carew, capteine George Carew, &amp; capteine Piers were
dispatched to serue against them.</p>
<p>The lord iustice from Waterford, vpon notice of the trouble dailie increasing, sent
a commission of the eleuenth of Februarie, to sir Warham Sentleger to be provost
marshall, authorising him to proc&eacute;ed according to the course of marshall law against
all offendors, as the nature of his or their offenses did merit and deserue; so that
the partie offendor be not able to dispend fortie shillings by the yeare in land, or annuitie,

shall banish all idlers &amp; sturdie beggers: that he shall apprehend aiders of outlawes
and th&eacute;eues, and execute all idle persons taken by night: that he shall giue in the
name and names of such as shall refuse to aid and assist him: that in dooing of his
seruice, he shall take horsse-meat and mans-meat where he list, in anie mans house
for one night: that euerie gentleman and noble man doo deliuer him a booke of all
the names of their seruants and followers: that he shall put in execution all statutes
against merchants and other penall lawes, and the same to s&eacute;e to be read and published
in euerie church by the parson and curat of the same: and that he doo euerie
moneth certifie the lord iustice how manie persons, and of their offenses and qualities,
that he shall execute and put to death: with sundrie other articles, which generallie
are comprised in euerie commission for the marshall law.</p>
<p>The lord iustice, after that he had rested about thr&eacute;e weekes at Waterford, he remooued
and went to Clomnell, where the earle of Ormond met him, being the
fift&eacute;enth of Februarie 1579, and from thense he went by iourneies vnto Limerike,
where the chancellor of Limerike vpon suspicion of treason was committed to prison,
<note place="marg">The chancellor of Limerike sent to ward for treason.</note>
and his lodging being searched, manie masse bookes and other popish trash, togither

And the bishop likewise was vpon some suspicion committed prisoner vnto his owne

house.</p>
<p>And out of Limerike he marched the tenth of March to Rathkell, where within
one houre the erle of Ormond came vnto him, and there consulted for the manner
of the persecution of the enimie. Which when they had agr&eacute;ed vpon, they passed
the next morning ouer the bridge of Adare, and by the waie they burned and spoiled
the countrie, and went to Rathkell. Now when they had amended the bridge

which the rebels had destroied, and made passable, they passed ouer the same into
Connilo, where the lord iustice and the earle of Ordmond diuided their companies,
and as they marehed they burned and destroied the countrie, and they both that
night incamped within one mile at Kilcolman. And there it was aduertised, that
Nicholas Parker lieutenant vnto capteine Fenton, comming from Limerike with
fiue horssemen, and thr&eacute;e shot, which were of the garrison at Adare, he was set
vpon at Rathkell by a hundred traitors, which did discharge sixt&eacute;ene or eight&eacute;ene
<note place="marg">Nicholas Parker verie valiantlie defendeth himselfe.</note>
shot at him, and sundrie darts, before he espied them: but he and Iames Fenton
the capteins brother, and Guidon, so bestirred themselues, that they gaue the enimie
the repulse, and slue their leader, with fiue or six others, and so came safe to the
campe, but with the hurt of one of their horsses.</p>
<p>The souldiers likewise in the campe were so hot vpon the spurre, &amp; so eger vpon
the vile rebels, that that day they spared neither man, woman, nor child, but all
was committed to the sword. The same daie, a souldier of the marshals incountered
with two iustie Kernes, the one of them he slue, and the other he compelled
to carrie his fellows head with him to the campe: which when he had doone,
his head also was cut off and laid by his fellowes. The next daie following, being
the twelfe of March, the lord iustice and the earle diuided their armie into two
seuerall companies by two ensignes and thr&eacute;e togither, the lord iustice taking the
one side, and the other taking the other side of Slewlougher, and so they searched
the woods, burned the towne, and killed that daie about foure hundred men, and
returned the same night with all the cattell which they found that daie.</p>
<p>And the said lords, being not satisfied with this daies seruice, they did likewise
the next daie diuide themselues, spoiled and consumed the whole countrie vntill it
was night. And being then incamped n&eacute;ere togither, the baron of Lexnew came to
the earle of Ormond, whome the earle in the next morning brought before the lord
<note place="marg">The baron of Lexnew submitteth himselfe.</note>
deputie, where he in most humble maner y&eacute;elded, and submitted himselfe to his
lordships deuotion, promising and presenting his seruice with all dutifulnesse.
And then, when after great trauels they had maruellouslie wasted and spoiled the
countrie, they appointed to march to Carigofoile, and to laie siege to the same:
for in it laie the greatest force of the Desmonds, and which was garded and kept
by the Spaniards. This castell standeth in the riuer, and at euerie full sea both it
<note place="marg">The castell of Carigofoile is besieged.</note>
and the bannes about it are inuironed with the said flouds and flowing waters. Assoone
as they were incamped, the lord iustice approched the castell so n&eacute;ere as he
could, to take the view thereof, that accordinglie he might consider the most fittest
places for the laieng of the shot for the batterie: and then he commanded capteine
George Carew to take out certeine shot, and to go with him in this seruice. Now
<note place="marg">The lord iustice and capteine Carew take the view of the castell.</note>

<note place="marg">The castell besieged.</note>
the Spaniards hauing espied them, spent manie shot vpon them, and where the lord
iustice verie hardlie escaped with his life, and from being slaine with a musket shot.
When his lordship vpon this view had determined what he would doo, he caused the
canon shot to be planted in the place most fit for the batterie, for otherwise the fort
was not to be assaulted.</p>
<p>In the same were sixt&eacute;ene Spaniards and fiftie others vnder one Iulio an Italian,
who at the request of the countesse of Desmond vndertooke the k&eacute;eping of it, and
<note place="marg">The proud brags of the Spaniard.</note>
who reported himselfe to be a verie notable enginer: &amp; standing vpon his reputation,
he plied the campe with continuall shot, putting out an ensigne and railing with
manie bad speeches against hir maiestie; declaring also that they kept it for the king
of Spaine and so still would, vntill further aid were sent from him: and which in
verie d&eacute;ed was dailie looked for. Before the canons and other battering p&eacute;eces
could be vnladen, they spent the time, occupieng the one the other with such deuises
as they thought good for the seruices. And the Spaniards, hauing the ad

uantage, did by their often shot hurt and kill some Englishmen, namelie a souldior
of sir George Bourchiers, one of sir Henrie Wallops, &amp; one of capteine Zouches:
and sir William Stanleie comming with his companie to the trenches to take the
ward of capteine George Carew, which kept the watch that night past, was hurt
with a musket shot out of the castell in the necke. Assoone as the ordinance was
vnladen and planted, they began forthwith to, batter the fort with thr&eacute;e canons, a
<note place="marg">The castell is battered with shot.</note>
culuering, and a demie culuering; and in short time they so beat it, that the house
fell and filled the ditches: by meanes whereof the same became to be assaultable.</p>
<p>Capteine Macworth, who had the ward of that daie, entred into the vtter banne
<note place="marg">Capteine Macworth first entreth the castell.</note>
by a doore that the souldiors had broken, and was maister of it presentlie. The
Spaniards thervpon retired to a turret that was vpon the wall of the barbican, &amp; some
sought other places to hide and to saue themselues, but that part of the castell was
beaten downe: and then capteine Macworth recouered the possession of the whole,
<note place="marg">The castell of Carigofoile is taken.</note>
and did put fiftie to the sword, of which nineteene were found to be Spaniards; and
six others he tooke, whereof one was a woman, which were executed in the campe.
None were saued that daie but onelie the capteine Iulio, whome the lord iustice
kept for certeine considerations two or thr&eacute;e daies: but in the end he was hanged as

the rest were before him. The next daie, being the first of Aprill one thousand fiue
hundred and fourescore, the ordinances were remoued and caried to the ship, which
with all such souldiors as were sicke and hurt were sent to Limerike, to be relieued
and cured. This castell, one of the princpallest and chiefest forts thus recouered,
there resteth onelie the house and castell of Asketten: and the lord iustice, and the
earle of Ormond thought nothing more necessarie, than euen forthwith to march to
Asketten, and to incampe there and to besiege it, euen as they had doone to this fort
<note place="marg">The castell of Asketten appointed to be besieged.</note>
of Carigofoile. Where when they came, the two lords diuided themselues, the one
taking the one side, and the other taking the other side of the water: and vpon the
third of Aprill they incamped at the said castell, the lord iustice lieng in the abbeie,
and the earle of Ormond vpon the further side of the riuer.</p>
<p>The lord iustice viewed the place, and found no waie possible to place anie watch
or ward n&eacute;ere to the castell, by reason of the great disaduantage of the rockes which
<note place="marg">Sir William Stanleie and capteine George Carew besiege the castell of Balliloghan.</note>

<note place="marg">The warders forsake the castell.</note>
laie altogither vpon the castell. While the campe laie there, sir William Stanleie,
capteine George Carew, and capteine Walker went to giue siege vnto the castell of
Balliloghan, a strong house of the Desmonds, and which was warded vntill this
time against hir maiestie. The ward had no sooner the sight and view of these three
ensignes, but that they fired the house and fled: but they were so narrowlie pursued,
that the leader of them and some of his companie were ouertaken and slaine.
Whilest the siege laie at Asketten, sir Henrie Wallop treasuror at warres came from
Limerike to the campe the fourth of Aprill 1580: and the verie same night following,
being a verie darke and close night, the warders of the castell fearing the example
of the execution doone at Carigofoile, and doubting the sequele of the lord iustice
preparation made for the batterie to be laid against it, did abandon and forsake the
<note place="marg">The warders of Asketten forsake the castell and by a traine set it on fire.</note>
castell verie secretlie about midnight, leauing a traine of pouder to set it on fire,
which consumed &amp; burned a great part of the same: but the principall towers remained
vntouched. The warders by fauor of all the darke night escaped into the
woods.</p>
<p>This castell thus recouered, the earle of Desmond had neuer a castell in all Mounster
<note place="marg">The castell of Asketten is taken.</note>
which was warded against hir maiestie: but all were now at hir deuotion. The
lord iustice being possessed of Asketten, he appointed a strong garrison to reside
there, and placed sir Peter Carew, and sir Henrie Wallops companie in the castell;
and capteine George Carew, and capteine Hollingworth to be in the abbeie, and so

that the botes might passe fr&eacute;elie to and fro. At his comming to Limerike, all
<note place="marg">The armie is dispersed, and the garrisons are sent to their places appointed.</note>
things now s&eacute;eming to be at peace, the earle of Ormond returned home to Kilkennie,
&amp; certeine of the councell which had followed in this iourneie rode to Dublin:
and sir Nicholas Malbie departed into Connagh. And notwithstanding that the
most part of the armie was now dispersed into garrisons: yet the seruices of euerie
of them neuer abated. For alwaies as the time of seruice required, the Irishmen
were issued out vpon, and most commonlie had the worst side. And the lord
iustice himselfe taking an occasion to visit the ward at Adare, he passed by water,
and capteine Case went by land, and after a time spent in searching the woods, they
returned with a preie of one thousand and two hundred kine, and verie good store
of sh&eacute;epe, besides the slaughter of manie traitors.</p>
<p>At his being and during his abode in Limerike, vpon the fifteenth of Maie, he receiued
hir maiesties commission vnder the broad seale of England to be lord iustice
(where before he held the same by the election and order of the councell) and therewith
also one other commission, for creating of sir William Burke baron of castell
<note place="marg">A commission to create sir William Burke to be baron.</note>
Connall, with a yearelie pension of one hundred markes during his life. And from
this time, the lord iustice spent this summer in Mounster, trauelling to and fro
through out the whole prouince: he himselfe and euene other capteine in his seuerall
garrison dooing such seruice vpon the rebels as by occasion was offred. The lord
iustice vpon the fifteenth of Iune, after that he had marched a few miles in Mac
Aulies countrie, spoiling, defacing, and burning the same, he passed through the boggie
mounteine of Slewlougher into Kerrie, and there he discouered a great preie of
the countrie; and pursuing the same, by the voward of his horssemen, and he himselfe
in person tooke about two thousand kine, besides store of sh&eacute;epe and garons,
with part of the traitors masking apparell. The earle of Desmond, the countesse
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond and his wife and doctor Sanders in perill to betaken.</note>
his wife, and doctor Sanders little thinking of this matter, escaped verie hardlie;
and their priest for hast was faine to leaue his gowne behind. The like seruice he
did the next daie, being the fiue and twentith of Iune at Castelmange. But at this
<note place="marg">A mutinie among the souldiors for lacke of vittels.</note>
time, a great mutinie began amongest the souldiors vnder sir George Bourchier,
capteine Macworth, and capteine Dowdall, by reason of their wants. but his lordship
with such lenitie and courtesie handled the matter, that they departed from him
well satisfied. Likewise sir Cormac Mac Teige shiriffe of the countie of Corke did
<note place="marg">Sir Cormac Mac Teige dooth a p&eacute;ece of seruice vpon sir Iames of Desmond.</note>
notable seruice vpon sir Iames of Desmond; which sir Iames vpon the fourth of
August made a roade into Muskroie, and tooke a great preie from the foresaid sir
Cormac. Wherevpon his brother Donnell assembleth his brothers tenants and
countrie and followed the preie, and recouered the same; sir Iames, who thought it
to be too great a dishonor and reproch to depart with anie thing which he had in
hand, withstanding the matter.</p>
<p>Wherevpon they fell at hand-fight. In which conflict and fight the said Donnell
behaued himselfe so valiantlie, and his companie so Iustilie stucke to the matter, that
the preie was recouered, and sir Iames himselfe mortallie wounded and taken prisoner,
<note place="marg">Sir Iames of Desmond in taking of a preie is taken prisoner and executed.</note>
and all his force, being aboue a hundred and fiftie persons, were slaine and ouerthrowne.
He that tooke him was a smith, and seruant to sir Cormac, who foorthwith
handfasted him: and for anoiding of certeine inconueniences, he kept him
close, and secretlie hid him in a certeine bush in the fastnesse there, and bound him so
fast and sure, that he could not escape nor run awaie. And when all the companie
was gone, then he tooke him and carried him to sir Cormac his maister, who kept him
in safe custodie, vntill, by letters of commandement from the lord iustice and councell,
he did deliuer him vnto sir Warham Sentleger then prouost marshall, and to
<note place="marg">Sir Iames of Desmond sent to sir Warham</note>
capteine Raleigh; who (according to a commission in like order to them addressed)

was examined, indicted, arreigned, and then vpon iudgement drawen, hanged and
<note place="marg">Sentleger &amp; to capteine Raleigh, and was executed to death.</note>
quartered: and his bodie being quartered, it was togither with the head set on the
towne gates of the citie of Corke, and made the preic of the foules. And thus the
pestilent hydra hath lost an other of his heads.</p>
<p>This seruice of this knight was maruellouslie well accepted, and first from the
lord iustice and councell, and then from hir maiestie he receiued verie fr&eacute;endlie and
thankfull letters. This man was a yonger house vnto Mac Artie Reough, and they
both a yonger house vnto Mac Artie More now earle of Clancar, aud whose ancestors
(as is said) were kings before the conquest of Mounster. They are all men
of great power, and greatlie est&eacute;emed in those parties. But this sir Cormac, in
dutie and obedience to hir maiestie and hir lawes, and for his affection to all Englishmen,
surpasseth all his owne sept &amp; familie, as also all the Irishrie in that land.
For albeit a m&eacute;ere Irish gentleman can hardly digest anie Englishman or English
gouernment, &amp; whatsoeuer his outward appearance be, yet his inward affection is
corrupt and naugbt: being not vnlike to lupiters cat, whome though he had transformed
<note place="marg">Iupiters cat.</note>
into a beautifull ladie, and made hir a noble princesse; yet when she saw the
mouse, she could not forbeare to snatch at him; and as the ape, though he be neuer
so richlie attired in purple, yet he will still be an ape. This knight, after he did
once y&eacute;eld himselfe to hir maiesties obedience, and had professed his loialtie, he euer
<note place="marg">The loialtie of sir Cormac Mac Teige.</note>
desired to ioine himselfe vnto the companie of the Englishmen, and became in time
a faithfull and fr&eacute;endlie man vnto them, liued according to hir maiesties lawes,
and did so good seruice at all times when it was requisit and required, as none of that
nation did euer the like. And if at anie time he were had in suspicion, he would by
some kind of seruice purge &amp; acquite himselfe, euen as he did in this present seruice
in taking of sir Iames of Desmond, to his great praise &amp; commendation, and to his
acquitall against the reprochfull reports of his aduersaries. And sir William Fitzwilliams
in the time of his deputiship, hauing had a verie good triall of his fidelitie,
truth, and good seruice, did giue vnto him the order of knighthood, and made him
<note place="marg">Sir Cormac Mac Teige made knight.</note>
shiriffe of the countie of Corke: euen as the lord iustice now did commend this his
seruice vnto hir maiestie by his letters of the twelfe of August, a thousand fiue
hundred and eightie, and praieng that the same might be so acceptablie receiued,
as that the enobling of him might be both an ornament to his house, an incoraging
vnto others to doo the like, and a testimonie against others of his sort, who haue
neglected a number of occasions (at greater aduantages) to haue doone the like
seruices.</p>
<p>The death of Iames of Desmond, and the quartering of his bodie did maruellouslie
dismaie the earle himselfe, sir Iohn his other brother, and doctor Sanders, and
all their confederats. And by reason of the continuall persecuting of the rebels,
who could haue no breath nor rest to rel&eacute;eue themselues, but were alwaies by one
garrison or other hurt and pursued; and by reason the haruest was taken from
them, their cattels in great numbers preied from them, and the whole countrie
spoiled and preied; the poore people, who liued onelie vpon their labors, and fed
<note place="marg">The miserie of the people.</note>
by their milch cowes, were so distressed, that they would follow after the goods
which were thus taken from them, and offer themselues, their wiues, and children,
rather to be slaine by the armie, than to suffer the famine wherewith they were now
pinched. And this great calamitie made also a diuision betweene the earle of Desmond
and his brother sir Iohn, either of them excusing that whereof they were
both guiltie. The earle himselfe (without rest) fl&eacute;eth from place to place, and

requests) sute, that hir husband might be taken to submission.</p>
<p>Sir Iohn of Desmond, being in the like distresse, he togither with doctor Sanders
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn of Desmond minded to ioine with the vicount Baltinglasse.</note>
gaue the aduenturc, to passe for their refuge to the vicount Baltinglasse, then being
in the countie of Kildare. The garrison which laie at Kilmallocke, making an issue
out by night to doo some seruice, by chance met the said Iohn and Sanders in the
darke night: and not knowing them did set vpon them, and of foure of them they
tooke two, the one being a frier named Iames Haie and standardbearer to the late
Iames Fitzmoris, who vpon his examination confessed that the earle of Desmond
was author of all these warres, and the other was Sanders man, who was slaine; and
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn of Desmond and doctor Sanders in flieng, were in danger to be taken.</note>
the frier was reserued, but sir Iohn and the doctor by the benefit of the darknesse
verie hardlie escaped, &amp; cut off from their iourneie. The lord iustice being at Newcastell,
and being aduertised that the earle of Desmond and Sanders were in Kerrie,
he foorthwith sent for the garrisons of Adare and Asketten to come to him, and for
the garrison of Kilmallocke to m&eacute;et him at the place, daie and time appointed, for
a speciall peece of seruice then to be doone. Whose commandement being doone
and obeied, they tooke their waie into Kerrie, and there they had taken the earle,

and his countesse, and doctor Sanders, had not a false brother bewraied the matter,
and yet for hast they left their breakfast behind them halfe dressed. Neuerthelesse,
they tooke two preies, the one of fift&eacute;ene and the other of eighteene kine; and
the next daie they tooke another preie of two hundred kine, slue diuerse traitors,
and tooke two friers, whose gownes were too long for them to follow the earle and
the popes nuntio, they being poore bare footed friers, and he a lustie horsman: and
then his lordship returned to Asketten, where he left maister Parker conestable of
the place; and from thense he went to Limerike, where he receiued news by master
Zouch, and after by letters from the lord Greie lord deputie, of his arriuall to
Dublin. And then his lordship minding to make his sp&eacute;edie repaire to Dublin, did
set the countrie in some good order, and by the aduise of the councell at Limerike,
he appointed sir George Bourcher coronell of all Mounster, and instructions were
<note place="marg">Sir George Bourcher coronell of Mounster.</note>
deliuered vnto him, both for certeine speciall seruices to be doone, &amp; also for the
generall gouernement of the whole prouince; &amp; had left vnto him the charge (vnder
his gouernement) of the whole forces in Mounster; which of footmen were two
thousand eight hundred &amp; twentie; and of horssemen thr&eacute;e hundred fourescore and
<note place="marg">This force is both of the princes paie, and of the lord of the prouince.</note>
fift&eacute;ene: the whole, thr&eacute;e thousand two hundred and fift&eacute;ene men. Likewise he
had sent the like instructions to sir Warham Sentleger, and the erle of Clancar.
And these &amp; other like things doone, he tooke his iourneie through Conaugh for
the like establishing of the countrie, &amp; came to Dublin the sixt daie of September,
one thousand fine hundred fourescore and one; and the next daie he deliuered vp
the sword to the lord Greie, as to the lord deputie of Ireland, in saint Patrikes
church in presence of the councell, noble men, and gentlemen, which were for the
same purpose there assembled.</p>

force and strength, by meanes of the companie of capteine Fitzgirald, kinsman
to the earle of Kildare, who had a band of footmen committed vuto him in the beginning
of this rebellion, for the defense of the countie of Kildare, which bordereth
fast by the Obrins. And he nothing regarding now, either the dutie of a
subiect, or his owne credit, most traitorouslie reuolteth from his lawfull prince,
and conioineth himselfe with traitors and rebels. And with these he practiseth and

persuadeth to resist and make head against hir maiesties forces; because they could
not (as he said) withstand or preuaile against them: who without anie reward promised,
were easilie persuaded, because they would be persuaded, and were most willing
to exercise anie maner of outrage. All these thus combined, drew one string,
&amp; incamped themselues in the fastnes of the Glinnes, about 20 miles from Dublin,
where they kept all their goods &amp; cattell. This fastnesse was by nature so strong
<note place="marg">The strength of the fastnesse in the Glinnes.</note>
as possible might be: for in it is a vallie or a combe lieng in the midle of the wood,
of a great length, betweene two hils, &amp; no other waie is there to passe through.
Vnder foot it is boggie and soft, and full of great stones and slipperie rocks, verie
hard and euill to passe through; the sides are full of great &amp; mightie trees vpon the
sides of the hils, &amp; full of bushments and vnderwoods.</p>
<p>The lord deputie, being not yet acquainted with the custome of the countrie,
nor with the Irish seruices, and thinking himselfe in honor to be touched, and the
whole armie to be discredited, if a companie of traitors should lie so n&eacute;ere vnto
him, and not be touched nor fought withall, resolued himselfe to haue a p&eacute;ece
of seruice to be doone vpon them. Wherfore he with all his whole armie marcheth
vnto the said Glinnes, &amp; giueth order to sir William Stanleie, sir Peter Carew, sir
<note place="marg">A seruice appointed to be doone against the Obrins.</note>
Henrie Bagnoll, capteine Awdleie, and to Iohn Parker, lieutenant to capteine Furse
with all their footmen, and to Francis Cosbie capteine of the kerne, and George
Moore an old veteran of Berwike, coronell of all the footmen, to take this seruice
vpon them. But Coshie, who had b&eacute;ene a long seruitor, and knew what to that
kind of seruice did belong, did fores&eacute;e the danger which would follow hereof, and
so declared it to his companie: notwithstanding to auoid the reproches which might
be laied to his charge, followed the said seruice, and vpon the next daie, being the
fiue &amp; twentith of August, they entered the Glinnes.</p>
<p>The lord deputie being accompanied with the earle of Kildare, Iaques Wingefield,
capteine George Carew, capteine Denie, and others on horssebacke staied
vpon the mounteine side hard by the wood. The archtraitor Fitzgirald, hauing
<note place="marg">The lord depurie staied vpon the mounteins.</note>
some secret intelligence of the seruice towards, he bestoweth and placeth all his
men with their peeces amongst the tr&eacute;es, and there couered themselues, vntill the
Englishmen were entered and passed into the fastnesse, about halfe a mile or more,
and could not easilie returne: and he hauing them at aduantage vpon euerie side
of the hill, with great furie assaileth them with his shot, and in verie short time did
kill the most part of the voward, both capteins and souldiors. The residue which
followed, being in despaire to recouer what was lost, and distrusting themselues,
fled at all hands, and ran backe as fast as they could in so bad a waie. And yet
such was the nimblenesse of the traitors, and their skill of seruice in such places,
that they were like to haue b&eacute;ene killed; if the lord deputie, and the horssemen
had not rescued them: vpon whose comming they retired into their fastnesse.</p>
<p>In this conflict, George More, capteine Audleic, Francis Cosbie, and sir Peter
<note place="marg">The Englishmen slaine in the Glinnes.</note>
Carew coronell, were then murthered and slaughtered; which sir Peter was verie
well armed, and with running in his armor, which he could not put off, he was
halfe smothered, and inforced to lie downe: whome when the rebels had taken,
they disarmed him, &amp; the most part of them would haue saued him, and made request
for him, they thinking that more profit would grow among them by his life
than benefit by his death. Notwithstanding, one villaine most butcherlie, assoone
<note place="marg">Sir Peter Carew slaine.</note>
as he was disarmed, with his sword slaughtered and killed him; who in time after
was also killed. Before the entrie into this seruice, Iaques Wingfield being acquainted

which was feared would insue, persuadeth with his two nephues, sir Peter

and capteine George Carew, to staic and to forbeare to aduenture into the woods,
But sir Peter could not listen therevnto, nor be persuaded; but would n&eacute;eds go in.
His brother would haue doone the like, but his vncle perforce kept him, saieng;
"If I lose one, yet I will keepe the other:" and so by that meanes he was by Gods
goodnesse saued and preserued.</p>
<p>This blacke daie was a dolefull and a gr&eacute;euous daie to the lord deputie and all
his companie: notwithstanding, hoping of a hard beginning would follow a better
ending tooke the matter as patientlic as he could, and made his returne vnto Dublin,
abiding the comming of the lord iustice; who as soone as he was returned,
then the lord Greie was sworne, and had the sword deliuered vnto him. The earle
of Ormond in this meane time, being verie desirous to doo some seruice vpon the
Spaniards, being nothing afraid of their force and multitude, marcheth towards the
fort, and incampeth at Traleigh, where the scout the same night espied a light in
the enimies campe, and by reason of the darke night, the companie of them seemed
to be the greater: which caused the gouernor to be more watchfull and circumspect.
Wherefore in the morning, like a wise and a politike capteine, setteth all his companis
<note place="marg">The earle marcheth in order of battell to the fort.</note>
in battell araie, &amp; so marcheth forwards in his strength &amp; verie good order
ouer the strand of Traleigh towards the fort, euerie man being at a full resolution to
doo his best seruice that day against the enimie. When these strangers had knowledge
of the approching of the lord gouernor, and his companie, albeit their fort
was verie strong, both by nature and by art; yet they distrusted themselues, and
<note place="marg">The Spaniards leaue their fort.</note>
forsooke the fort, and by the guiding of the Irishrie, they remoued themselues from
thense to Glanningell, whome the gouernor pursued, &amp; ouertooke some of them,
vpon whome he gaue the onset, and skirmished with them: diuerse of them he
<note place="marg">The earle followeth the Spaniards and putteth them to the foile.</note>
slue, and manie he tooke, whome he caried along with him: the residue of them
fled into the fastnesse of Glanningell, which is a verie strong place and couert,
by reason of the great woods and of the mounteines adioining. Wherevpon the
daie being spent, and no seruice for that time to be doone anie further, the lord
gouernor incamped there that night, fast to their enimies nose, to trie him what he
would, or durst doo.</p>
<p>Assoone as he was incamped, he calleth the prisoners (who were taken) before
<note place="marg">The companie of the Spaniards not aboue seuen score.</note>
him, and they confessed that they were in number, not aboue seuen hundred men;
but had brought with them pikes, caliuers, munitions, and all kinds of artillerie,
sufficient for fiue thousand men: because they knew that the Irishmen were of
bodies sufficient, but that they lacked furniture and training; &amp; in these two things
they minded to furnish them: and further also they said, that they had sent backe
two of their ships into Spaine, to aduertise that they were safelie arriued, and how
that they were interteined: requesting that the supplie appointed before their comming
from home, might with all sp&eacute;ed be sent awaie, and for which they did dailie
looke: because it was throughlie concluded betw&eacute;ene the pope and king Philip,
to make a through conquest of all Ireland; and so consequentlie as time should
<note place="marg">The determinations of the pope and king Philip, to make a through conquest of Ireland.</note>
serue, to doo the like with England. And moreouer, that they had brought with
them a great masse and store of monie and treasure, which according to their commission
they had deliuered to the earle of Desmond, sir Iohn his brother, &amp; to doctor
Sanders the popes nuntio; and more is promised to be sent.</p>
<p>After these things thus doone, it was giuen to the said gouernor to vnderstand,
that the same night there were three hundred souldiors of the enimies companie returned
&amp; gone backe to the fort. Wherevpon he returned also, and followed
<note place="marg">The earle of Ormond in campeth at the fort.</note>
them the next morning, and came to Dingle, where he incamped as n&eacute;ere to the
fort as he could; and there choosing to himselfe capteine Dowdall, capteine Piers,

and certeine shot, he drew so neere to the fort as he had the whole discouerie and
sight of the fort and companie therein, which s&eacute;emed to be easie to be gotten, if
he had anie shot and munitions for the same. But as neither the scholer without
<note place="marg">The earle for lacke of munition could not preuaile against the fort.</note>
his booke, nor the artificer without his tooles, can doo anie thing in his profession:
no more can the souldior fight without his meet weapons, nor serue without his necessaries:
and therefore for want of things necessarie for this batterie, the lord
gouernor was driuen to returne, and to leaue the fort.</p>
<p>The Spaniards perceiuing this, or mistrusting some other matter, made a sallie
<note place="marg">The Spaniards issue out and giue a skirmish.</note>
of thr&eacute;escore men; and the gouernor seeing their aduantage, thought to follow the
aduise of his capteins, and not to haue dealed at all with them. But one Andrew
Martin more bastic than aduised, and more rash than wise, procured a skirmish
with them, in which he was slaine; and the lord gouernor compelled of force to
answer the skirmish. But it was not long, but that he sounded the retract; and
being not able to annoie the enimie, nor preuaile at the fort, he returned backe
againe, and by iourneies he came to Rekell: where he met the lord deputie, vnto
<note place="marg">The lord deputie commeth to Rekell, and is there met by the earle of Ormond.</note>
whom he y&eacute;elded vp all his companie, and his commission, and then made prouision
of his men, and for victuals, to follow the said lord deputie. The lord deputie
had now in his companie about eight hundred men, horssemen and footmen,
vnder the leadings of capteine Zouch, capteine Walter Raleigh, capteine Denie,
who had also capteine George Carews companie vnder his ensigne, capteine Macworth,
capteine Achin, and others: and then he marched towards the fort where
the Spaniards and Romans were setled.</p>
<p>Capteine Raleigh, notwithstanding that the lord deputie had raised his campe at
Rekell, and was gone towards the fort, yet he taried and staied behind, minding
to practise some exploit. For it was not vnknowne vnto him, that it was a maner
among the Irish kerns, that whensoeuer anie English campe was dislodged and remooued,
they would after their departures come to those camps to take what they
there found to be left. Thus therefore lieng, and k&eacute;eping himselfe verie close,
taried and abode the comming of the said kerns; who suspecting no such trap to
be laid for them, came after their maners and old vsages to the said place, and there
tooke their pleasure, who when they were in their securitie, the capteine and his
men came vpon them, and tooke them all. Among them there was one, who caried
and was laden with withs, which they vsed insted of halters: and being demanded
what he would doo with them, and whie he caried them; gaue answer, that they
were to hang vp English churls; for so they call Englishmen. "Is it so (quoth
the capteine) well, they shall now serue for an Irish kerne:" and so commanded
him to be hanged vp with one of his owne withs; the residue he handled according
to their deserts.</p>
<p>The lord deputie incamped himselfe as n&eacute;ere the fort as he could. And at this
<note place="marg">The lord deputie marcheth to the fort, and besiegeth it.</note>
present was sir William Winter also newlie returned from out of England: but he
arriued at Kinsale, and his vice admerall capteine Bingham came into the baie of
saint Marie weeke or Smerew&eacute;eke, and not long after, sir William Winter himselfe
followed. And by these means the said lord deputie was so well furnished of all
things necessarie, that he at land, and sir William Winter at sea besieged the fort.
But before anie assault giuen, he first summoned the fort; requiring of them who
<note place="marg">The fort is summoned.</note>
they were, what they had there to doo, by whom they were sent, and whie they
fortified in hir maiesties land, &amp; required therewith to y&eacute;eld vp the fort. But
they answered that they were sent some from the holie fatther, which had giuen
<note place="marg">The answer of the fort.</note>
that realme to king Philip; and some from king Philip, who was to receiue and recouer
that land to the holie church of Rome, which by hir maiesties means was be

<!--<fw place="top-left">"438"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>-->


come schismaticall, and out of the church, with other reprochfull speeches: and
that therfore they were in that respect to k&eacute;epe what they had, and to recouer
what they yet had not. Wherevpon the lord deputie sent to sir William Winter, to
haue conference with him, how, in what sort, and by what waies they were to
worke for the dispossessing of these strangers from their fort, and how their artillerie
and munitions might be best placed and laied for the batterie; and betw&eacute;ene
whom it was then determined how all things should be doone.</p>
<p>Whiles they were thus in speeches, and consulting of the matter, the Spaniards
<note place="marg">The Spaniards make a sallie vpon the Englishmen.</note>
thinking to take some aduantage, made a sallie vpon the Englishmen: which was
forthwith answered by capteine Denie (who as then had but a doozzen shot) and by
Michaell Butler lieutenant to capteine Raleigh: &amp; these so valiantlie behaued themselues,
and so worthilie followed the fight, that they made the Spaniards with more
hast than with good speed to returne againe to their fort. The same night following,
sir William Winter, according to the conclusion betw&eacute;ene the lord deputie
and him, he did cause to be vnloden certeine culuerings, and like p&eacute;eces of ordinance
out of hir maiesties ships, which then laie in the rode of Smereweeke, and
then there being a great banke betweene the shores side and the fort, through
which the ordinance were to be caried, they did in the same night cut through that
<note place="marg">The diligent seruice of the mariners.</note>
banke, caried their ordinance through it, and mounted them in the place appointed,
before the breake of the daie, and before it was open daie the batterie was readie
to be giuen. A p&eacute;ece of seruice (the place and time considered) thought woorthie
great commendations. The lord deputie likewise had doone the like vpon the land
<note place="marg">The fort is beset vpon the land side.</note>
side, &amp; so being on both sides in readinesse to follow the seruice, his lordship summoned
them by the shot of a p&eacute;ece of ordinance, offering vnto them mercie if they
would y&eacute;eld. But they knowing nothing what was doone that night, answered as
before, that they would k&eacute;epe what they had, and would increase what they could
get. Wherevpon they began to batter the fort on both sides, both by land
and by water. This first daie of batterie was captaine Raleighs ward daie. But
the Spaniards made their brags, that they cared not for this; and to set a good
face vpon it, some of them sallied out, and offered the skirmish, but verie faintlie
and fearefullie: and so both vpon the first daie, the second daie, and the third
daie, little was doone, but onelie the continuance of the batterie. The fourth
daie was capteine Zouches ward daie, vnder whom was a lustie yoong gentleman
named Iohn Ch&eacute;eke, who drew so n&eacute;ere the fort, that he looked ouer the purport
<note place="marg">Iohn Ch&eacute;eke is slaine.</note>
into it, which being s&eacute;ene and perceiued, one of the Spaniards leuelled a p&eacute;ece
at him, &amp; with his shot strake him in the head, wherewith he died. About the end
of these foure daies, the trenches for the full batterie were drawne and brought so
n&eacute;ere vnto the fort, that now they left to dallie anie longer with the fort, but verie
hotlie and sharpelie they battered at it on both sides. The Spaniards, who had staied
<note place="marg">The fort is battered on euerie side.</note>
themselues vpon the hope of some further supplie, to come out of their countrie,
and thinking of some better aid of the erie of Desmond, &amp; of his brethren, than
yet they had receiued; and s&eacute;eing also the batterie to be such as they could not be
able to withstand and hold out, they desired a parl&eacute;e with the lord deputie, who vtterlie
<note place="marg">The Spaniards desire a parl&eacute;e.</note>
denied it: saieng, that his seruice was against traitors and rebels, with whom
no sp&eacute;eches nor parl&eacute;es are allowed. And forsomuch as they (though strangers by
birth) otherwise did confederat with them in such a traitorous action, they were in
the like predicament with them. Then they requested that they might haue libertie
to depart with bag &amp; baggage, which also would not be granted. Then they requested
that certeine particular men among themselues might haue their fr&eacute;e passage,
and certeine other conditions: but my lord refused both this, and all other

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"conditions,"</fw>-->


<pb n="439"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"439"</fw>-->


conditions, requiring an absolute y&eacute;elding, or nothing at all. When they saw that
they could not preuaile anie waie, then at the length they hanged out a white flag,
and with one voice they all cried out <emph>Misericordia, misericordia,</emph> and offered to y&eacute;eld
both themselues and the fort, without anie condition at all. Which thing when it
was aduertised to his lordship, he sent capteine Iaques Wingfield master of the
<note place="marg">Capteine Wingfield is sent to the fort.</note>
ordinance to the fort, and to make triall whether this their offer were true and vnfeigned:
who when he came to the fort, he was receiued in, and foorthwith the
capteine of the fort came vnto him, and in all humble maner y&eacute;elded himselfe to be
brought, and to be presented vnto the lord deputie: and at the commandement of
the said Iaques Wingfield he disarmed himselfe, and caused all his companie to doo
the like, and to bring all the armour in the fort into one place; and there they
laied their pikes acrosse vpon the same. Which being doone, the said capteine
Wingfield came out of the fort, and brought the capteine with him, promising him
safe conduct to the lord deputie. But by the waie, his lordship sent some to receiue
him at his hands, and willed the said Iaques Wingfield to returne againe to
the fort.</p>
<p>In this fort sir Iames Fitzgirald knight, and lord of the Decies, was a prisoner by
<note place="marg">The prisoners in the fort deliuered.</note>
the order of the earle of Desmond, and one Plunket an Irishman, and one Englishman,
which came and accompanied the traitors out of Spaine. The knight was set
at libertie, but the other two were executed. When the capteine had y&eacute;elded himselfe,
and the fort appointed to be surrendered, capteine Raleigh together with capteine
Macworth, who had the ward of that daie, entered into the castell, &amp; made
a great slaughter, manie or the most part of them being put to the swoord. And
when all things were cl&eacute;ere, the lord deputie came to the fort, and hauing doone
what pleased him, his lordship returned, and manie of the capteins he saued. The
fort foorthwith was rased, the armor and munitions were dispersed abroad, and all
things doone as it pleased the lord deputie, he sent the coronell and campemaister
ouer into England by capteine Denie, and dismissed the armie, and sent euerie
capteine to his garrison. And his lordship went from thense to Dingham, which is
a long scattering waste towne, and in it foure or fiue castels, which the earle of Desmond
had caused to be defaced in the beginning of this rebellion.</p>
<p>And heere the earle of Ormond met with the lord deputie with a new supplie
<note place="marg">Capteine Zouch made the gouernour of Desmond.</note>
of his owne men, being readie to haue followed the seruice if need had so required.
In this towne the lord deputie made capteine Zouch gouernor of Kerrie and Desmond,
and appointed vnto him thr&eacute;e hundred men, and accompanied him with
capteine Cash, who had one hundred men, and capteine Achin, who had fiftie
horssemen, and commanded these to lie in garrison in that towne, or where they
thought good. And these had to them giuen all the victuals which were found in
the fort. And from hense his lordship went to Limerike, and came thither the
<note place="marg">Capteine Berkeleie came into Ireland, and laie at Asketten.</note>
seauen and twentith of Nouember, in the yeare of our Lord one thousand fiue
hundred &amp; eightie. At which time there arriued out of England six new bands
of soldiers, vnder the leading of capteine Berkleie, capteine Cruse, capteine Herd,
and capteine Tanner, all which his lordship bestowed in seuerall garrisons, and in
such places as were most meet for seruice; capteine Berkelie onelie of the capteins
remained in Mounster, and was placed in the house of Asketten, the cheefest castell
of the earle of Desmond with two hundred men. The others went into Connagh,
where the wicked sonnes of the earle of Clanricard were now vpon their
keeping. For notwithstanding that the Spaniards were ouerthrowne, and thereby
a sufficient warning was giuen to the rebels, to bethinke themselues, that if they did
persist in their rebellions, the like would also insue vpon them: yet see how that

<p>The lord deputie being at this present in Limerike, &amp; aduertised of these troubles,
<note place="marg">The earle of Ormond is the gouernour of Mounster.</note>
setteth all things in order for the seruice in Mounster, and committed the whole
gouernement of that prouince vnto the earle of Ormond, and then he returned
vnto Dubline, where he tooke order for Connagh &amp; Leinster. And about this
time there arriued out of England 150 horssemen set out at the charges of the
<note place="marg">The cleargies band doo arriue into Ireland.</note>
cleargie of England, vnder the leadings of William Russell sonne to the earle of
Bedford, and of Brian Fitzwilliams, which were dispersed according to the seruice.
The lord deputie being returned vnto Dubline, the earle of Kildare, and the baron
<note place="marg">The earle of Kildare, and the baron of Deluin had in suspicion, and are committed to ward.</note>
of Deluin his sonne in law, were had in suspicion to be partakers and secret dealers
of these rebellions, and thervpon were committed to ward vnder the custodie of
Iaques Wingfield maister of the ordinance. Immediatlie vpon whose apprehensions,
the lord Henrie Fitzgirald, sonne and heire to the said earle, and of the age about
seauent&eacute;ene yeares, being persuaded by his fosterfathers and followers, he fled into
Ophalia whereof he was baron, and there (as it was said) he was taken by the Oconhours,
<note place="marg">The earls son is kept by the Oconhours.</note>
and kept against his will for his safetie, vntill they did heare further what
should be become of the earle.</p>
<p>This thing being aduertised to the lord deputie, he coniectured that this was
but a surmised and colorable kind of dealing, to bleare his lordships eies: wherefore
by order and good aduise he first willed the earle to send for his sonne, who
did so. But his messenger returned with an answer, that the yoong lord was willing
to come, but the Oconhours, who were in doubt what should be become of the
earle, would in no wise suffer his sonne to depart, vnlesse they might haue good
assurance for his safe returne againe vnto them. The lord deputie not liking these
kind of fond excuses and disordered dealings, sent the earle of Ormond then being
<note place="marg">The earle of Ormond is sent for the yoong lord Fitzgirald.</note>
in Dubline, to deale with the Oconhours, who being accompanied with sir Edmund
and Piers his brethren, Nicholas White maister of the rolles, capteine George
Carew, capteine Macworth, and sundrie other capteins and gentlemen, made their
repaire to the borders and marches of Ophalia; whense after much talke to no purpose,
they all returned without the yoong lord. Neuertheles afterwards the Oconhours
when they had better considered of the matter, and had had some conference
with Hussen and others the earles men, and mistrusting that some further troubles
would insue, euen as the earle of Ormond had partlie threatened them; and doubting
also least the staieng of the sonne might be preiudiciall to the father; then in
all hast did send the yoong lord to the erle of Ormond, who caried him to Dubline,

to the ward, where he remained with his father, vntill they both and the baron of
Deluin were sent into England, where the earle and the baron were sent to the
Tower, and the yoong lord committed to the custodie of the earle of Bedford.

made, and small redresse had, he rode himselfe to Dubline vnto the lord deputie,
and made his complaints thereof, alledging that the outrages of the Barries and his
consorts were such, that vnlesse they were proclamed traitors, and with all diligence
followed and pursued, the euent therof would be verie euill, to the aggr&eacute;euance
of good subiects, &amp; to the incouragement of the wicked: whose insolencie
and pride was growne to such a heigth, that the swoord with extremitie was the
onelie meane now to redresse the same.</p>
<p>The lord deputie and councell, when they had heard and well considered this,
<note place="marg">Capteine Raleigh hath a commission, &amp; the inlargement of a band of horssemen to pursue the enimie.</note>
they sent him backe againe with a commission vnto himselfe, to seize and enter
vpon the castell and house of Barrie court, and all other the lands of the said Barrie:
and likewise to pursue and follow him in the best maner as he thought good:
and for his better seruice to be doone herein, he had certeine horssemen in wages
also giuen vnto him, and added vnto his ensigne of footmen whervpon he returned.
But before he was come backe to Corke, the case was altered; for the matter
was so ordered and handled by such as there and then were in authoritie, and so
manie delaies were vsed to hinder the good seruice purposed, that his commission
auailed him verie little or nothing, for the castell of Barrie Moore was committed
and deliuered to the custodie of the mother of the said Dauid Barrie, and by hir
set ouer vnto him hir sonne: and who foorthwith burned and defaced the said castell
<note place="marg">Dauid lord Barrie burneth and spoileth his owne house.</note>
being his principall house, as also wasted the whole countrie, and became more
woorse and outragious than he was before. This capteine making his returne from
Dubline, &amp; the same well knowne vnto the seneschall of Imokellie, through whose
countrie he was to passe, laie in ambush for him to haue intrapped him betw&eacute;ene
<note place="marg">Capteine Raleigh is laid for by the seneschall.</note>
Youghall and Corke, lieng at a foord, which the said capteine must passe ouer with
six horssemen, and certeine kerne. The capteine little mistrusting anie such
matter, had in his companie onelie two horssemen and foure shot on horssebacke,
which was too small a force in so doubtfull and dangerous times: neuerthelesse he
had a verie good guide, which was the seruant of Iohn Fitzedmunds of Cloue, a
good subiect, and this guide knew euerie corner and starting hole in those
places.</p>
<p>The capteine being come towards the foord, the seneschall had espied him alone,
his companie being scattered behind, and verie fiercelie pursued him, and crossed
<note place="marg">The seneschal followeth capteine Raleigh.</note>
him as he was to ride ouer the water, but yet he recouered the foord and was passed
ouer. The Irishman who was his guide, when he saw the capteine thus alone, and
so narrowlie distressed, he shifted for himselfe and fled vnto a broken castell fast by,
there to saue himselfe. The capteine being thus ouer the water, Henrie Moile,
<note place="marg">The distressed state of Henrie Moile.</note>
riding alone about a bowes shoot before the rest of his companie, when he was
in the midle of the foord, his horsse foundred and cast him downe; and being
afraid that the seneschals men would haue folowed him and haue killed him, cried
out to the capteine to come and to saue his life; who not respecting the danger he
himselfe was in, came vnto him, and recouered both him and his horsse. And then
Moile coueting with all hast to leape vp, did it with such hast and vehemencie,
that he quite ouer leapt the horsse, and fell into a mire fast by, and so his horsse
ran awaie, and was taken by the enimie. The capteine neuerthelesse staid still,
and did abide for the comming of the residue of his companie, of the foure shot
which as yet were not come foorth, and for his man Jenkin, who had about two
hundred pounds in moneie about him, and sat vpon his horsse in the meane while,
hauing his staffe in one hand, and his pistoll charged in the other hand. The

he was indeed) of great seruice, and hauing also a new supplie of twelue horssemen
and sundrie shot come vnto him; yet neither he nor anie one of them, being
twentie to one, durst to giue the onset vpon him, but onelie railed and vsed hard
speeches vnto him, vntill his men behind had recouered and were come vnto him,
and then without anie further harme departed.</p>
<p>It happened that not long after, there was a parlee appointed betw&eacute;ene the lord
gouernor and the rebels; at which the seneschall was present, and stood much
vpon his reputation. Capteine Raleigh being present began to charge him of his
cowardnesse before the earle of Ormond, that he being twentie of his side, to him
alone, durst not to incounter with him. Wherevnto he gaue no answer. But
one of his men standing by said; that his maister was that daie a coward; but
he would neuer be so forgetfull againe, if the like seruice were to be doone,
and in manie great terms exalted his maister the seneschall for his valiantnesse
and seruice. The earle of Ormond hearing those great sp&eacute;esches, tooke the matter
in hand, and offred vnto the seneschall, that if he and sir Iohn of Desmond there
present, and thr&eacute;e or foure others, the best they could choose, would appoint to
<note place="marg">The chalenge made by the earle of Ormond to the seneschall.</note>
meet him; capteine Raleigh, and such foure others as they would bring with them,
they would come to the same place, and passe ouer the great riuer vnto them, and
would there two for two, foure for foure, or six for six, fight and trie the matter
betw&eacute;ene them; but no answer was then giuen: whervpon the white knight was
afterwards sent vnto him with this chalenge, but the rebels refused it. Not long
after this, there were sp&eacute;eches made, that the earle of Ormond was to depart from
this long and wearie seruice into England, &amp; capteine Zouch should in his place
be the generall. Bet&eacute;ene the remoouing of the one, and the placing of the other,
sir William Morgan, capteine Raleigh, and capteine Piers had a commission to be
<note place="marg">Capteine Raleigh a commissioner in Mounster.</note>
gouernors of that part of Mounster, where they spent all that summer, and laie
for the most part at Lismore, and in the countrie and woods thereabouts, in continuall
seruices vpon the enimies from time to time, as occasion and oportunitie
serued.</p>
<p>And when the summer was spent, capteine Raleigh returned with all his band
vnto Corke, being in number eight horssemen and foure score footmen. And as
he passed through the countrie, it was aduertised to him, that Dauid Barrie an
archtraitor was at Cloue with a great troope of sundrie hundreds of men. Wherevpon
<note place="marg">Capteine Raleigh followeth vpon Barrie.</note>
he thought good to passe that waie through the towne of Cloue, minding to
trie the valor of Dauid Barrie, if by anie meanes he might m&eacute;et with him. And
euen at the verie towns end he found Barrie and all his companie, and with a lustie
courage gaue the onset vpon him. But Barrie refused it, and fled. And then this
capteine passing from thense, in his iorneie he espied in a plaine n&eacute;ere adioining to
a woods side, a companie of footmen by themselues, vpon whome with six horssemen
<note place="marg">Capteine Raleigh in danger to be killed.</note>
he gaue the charge: but these being cut off from the wood wherevnto they
were flieng, and hauing not succor now to helpe &amp; relieue themselues, they turned
backe, &amp; conioning themselues togither to withstand this force and onset made
vpon them, in which they behaued themselues verie valiantlie, and of the horsses
they killed fiue, of which capteine Raleigh his horsse was one, and he himselfe in
great danger, and like to haue b&eacute;ene slaine, if his trustie seruant Nicholas Wright
a Yorkshire man borne had not bin. For he perceiuing that his maisters horsse was
<note place="marg">The good seruice of Nicholas Wright.</note>
galled and stricken with a dart, and plunged so much, that to his s&eacute;eming he was
past seruice; the said Nicholas willed and called to an Irishman there, whose name
was Patrike Fagaw, that he should looke to his capteine, and either to rescue him,
or to giue charge vpon the enimie. Wherevpon the said Fagaw rescued his cap

teine, &amp; the said Nicholas Wright forthwith gaue the onset vpon six of the enimies
and slue one of them. And therewith came one Iames Fitzrichard an Irish gentleman
with his kerne to the rescue of the capteine, but his kerne was slaine, and
himselfe in danger. For Wright not looking on them followed the enimie verie
egerlie, and recompensed the losse of one with the slaughter of others. Which
capteine Raleigh perceiuing cried out to his man, saieng; "Wright, if thou be a
man, charge aboue hand &amp; saue the gentleman." Who at his maisters commandment
pressed into the middle of the enimies, and slue one of them, and so saued
the gentleman: and in which skirmish his horsse leg was cut vnder him. Diuerse
footmen were slaine of the enimies, and two were taken prisoners, whome they
carried with them to Corke.</p>
<p>At his lieng in Corke there were sundrie p&eacute;eces of scruices doone by him, all
which doo verie well deserue to be for euer registred. And amongst all others this
one point of his scruice deserueth both commendation and perpetuall remembrance.
<note place="marg">The lord Roch is had in suspicion, and is sent for.</note>
The lord Roch was growen into a suspicion that he was not sound of his loialtie.
Wherevpon capteine Raleigh by commandement was to fetch him and his ladie to
Corke vnto the generall. This thing was not so priuilie determined, but that the
seneschall and Dauid Barrie had knowledge thereof, and minding verelie to take
the capteine at some aduantage, they had assembled a great companie of themselues
to the number of seuen or eight hundred men to haue met with him either comming
or going. The capteine perceiuing and forethinking how dangerous his enterprise
was against so noble a man in that countrie as the lord Roch was, who
was verie well beloued, commanded vpon a sudden all his men one and other, both
horssemen and footmen, which in the whole were not aboue foure score and ten
persons, to be in a readinesse vpon the paine of death betw&eacute;ene ten and eleuen of the
clocke of the same night. At which time euerie man being in a readinesse, he tooke
<note place="marg">Capteine Raleigh commeth to the lord Reches house.</note>
his iorneie and marched toward the lord Roches house called Ballie in Harsh, which
is about twentie miles out of Corke, and came thither somewhat earlie in the
morning. At his comming he went foorthwith to the castell gate.</p>
<p>The townsmen when they saw their lords house and castell thus suddenlie beset,
they doubting the worst, did arme about fiue hundred of themselues. Wherevpon
capteine Raleigh placed and bestowed his men in battell raie in the towne it selfe,
&amp; marched againe to the castell gate, with certeine of his officers and gentlemen
of his band, as by name Michaell Butler, Iames Fulford, Nicholas Write, Arthur
Barlow, Henrie Swane, &amp; Pinking Huish; and they knocked againe at the gate.
And after a while there came three or foure of the said lord Roches gentlemen, &amp;
demanded the cause of their comming, vnto whome the capteine answered, that
he was come to speake with my lord: which was offered he should, so that he would
bring in with him but two or thr&eacute;e of his gentlemen, which the capteine was contented
with, yet in the end (but with much adoo) he came in with all these few
persons before named. When the capteine was once come within the castell, and
<note place="marg">Capteine Raleigh being receiued into the castell getteth in all his men.</note>
had entred into some sp&eacute;eches with the lord Roch, he so handled the matter by
deuises and meanes, that by little and little, and by some and some, he had gotten
in within the iron doore or gate of the courtlodge all his men. And then hauing
the aduantage, he commanded his men to stand and gard the said gate, that no
man should passe in or out: and likewise charged euerie man to come into the hall
with his p&eacute;ece well prepared, with two bullets. The lord Roch when he saw this, he
was suddenlie amazed &amp; stricken at the hart with feare: but dissembling the same,
he set a good face vpon the matter, and calling for meat, requested the capteine and
his foresaid gentlemen to sit downe, &amp; to k&eacute;epe him companie at dinner.

<!--<fw place="top-left">"444"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>-->


After dinner, the capteine falling into speeches with the said lord Roch, declared
plainlie vnto him the cause of his comming, and shewed that he and his wife
were accused to be traitors, and that he had a commission (which he shewed vnto
them) to take and carie them along with him to Corke: which he was to pernorme,
and so would. The lord Roch alledged manie excuses for himselfe and for his
wife, saieng in the end that he neither could nor would go: the capteine answered,
that if they would not go with a good will, they should perforce go against
their will. The lord Roch s&eacute;eing that there was no remedie, he y&eacute;elded: and then
<note place="marg">The lord Roch y&eacute;eldeth to go with capteine Raleigh.</note>
the capteine minding to lose no time, willed him to command and cause all those
of the towne, and all such as were about the house, to attend and be in redinesse to
aid him, and to set him foorth in his iorneie: which he did, and verie willinglie
shewed himselfe to abide and obeie the capteines commandement, saieng that
he would answer the matter well inough, and discharge whatsoeuer should be laid
to his charge, for he knew himselfe to be cleare. And so he made himselfe and his
wife redie to take the iorreie in hand, as the capteine did appoint and command:
and towards night they did set forward to Corke. But the night fell out to
be verie tempestuous and foule, and therewith so darke, that no man could s&eacute;e
hand or foot, nor yet discerne one another; and the waies also were so fowle, so
full of balks, hillocks, pits, and rocks, that the souldiors thereby were maruellouslie
troubled and incombred, some stumbled among the stones, some plunged into holes,
and some by their often fals were not onelie hurt, but also lost their armour, and
were maruellouslie spoiled: and besides that, they were among and in the middle
of the enimies, who laie in sundrie ambushes, thinking verelie to haue intercepted
them, and to haue set vpon them: but the darke night which was cumbersome to
themselues, was a shadow to shrowd them from their enimies. And in the end,
though with much trouble, they came to Corke in safetie, sauing one soldier named
Iohn Phelium, who by his often falling and stumbling among the stones and rocks,
did so hurt one of his feet, that he could neuer recouer the same, but did in the end
consume and rot awaie.</p>
<p>The capteine being come to the towne somewhat earlie in the morning, he was
receiued in, and presented his prisoners to the generall, with no little admiration
that he had escaped so dangerous a iorneie, being verelie supposed of all men that
he could neuer haue escaped. The lord Roch being brought to be examined, did
<note place="marg">The L. Roch acquiteth himselfe.</note>
so well answer for himselfe, that in the end he was acquited, and taken for a true
and a good subiect, and which in time was well tried and knowne. For not he
<note place="marg">The L. Roch and his sonnes good seruices.</note>
himselfe onlie, but all his sons and followers, did attend and performe all such seruices
as were laid vpon them; and in which, thr&eacute;e of his sonnes were killed by the
enimie in hir maiesties seruice.</p>
<p>Capteine Zouch (as is afore said) laie at the Dingham, among whose companie
there fell a dangerous and an extreme sicknesse: few or none escaped it, howbeit
manie died therein. And in which distresse it was aduertised him, that the earle
of Desmond and Dauid Barrie was assembled at Aghado with thr&eacute;e thousand men;
and he being verie desirous to doo some seruice vpon them, drew all his full force of
horsemen and footmen vnto Castelmange. And then by the aduise of his capteins
Achim and Cash, he suddenlie made an onset vpon his enimies, before they wist of
anie such thing, and slue a great companie of them, and draue the erle to such a
<note place="marg">Capteine Zouch putteth the earle of Desmond in danger to be taken.</note>
push, that he in his shirt was driuen to shift for himselfe, in the middle of his gallowglasses,
and by that means he escaped. The earle nothing liking this coorse
successe, sought a better place of safetie, and remooued himselfe to Harlow wood,
and passed by the waie to Kilmallocke. Which when the garrison there did vnder

stand, they pursued and followed him, namelie capteine Bourchier, capteine Dowdall,
capteine Makworth, and capteine Norris, thr&eacute;e miles togither vpon the plains
betweene Kilmallocke and the wood, and slue manie of the rebels. And capteine
Dowdall who was acquainted verie well with that wood, and in it had serued sundrie
times, he would n&eacute;eds, and did enter into the wood, where he met with the earle of
<note place="marg">Capteine Dowdall preieth the erle of Desmond</note>
Desmond now the second time, and gaue the onset vpon him, killed a great number
of his men, tooke from them their cariages, and droue awaie a great preie of kine,
<note place="marg">The seneschall preieth the garison of Lismore.</note>
and brought them to Kilmallocke to the garison. Neere about this time the seneschall
came to Lismore, and preied that countrie, and drone awaie their cattell.
Which when the garison heard, and were aduertised thereof, they issued, and followed
the preie to recouer it; but they were so incountered and skirmished withall,
that they lost the preie, and fiue and twentie of their men were slaine. Diuerse
skirmishes were dailie doone vpon the enimie, and manie iorneies made vpon them
to their great damages and hurts.</p>
<p>In the moneth of August next following, in the yeare of our Lord one thousand
fiue hundred eightie and one, the lord deputie made a iorneie into Mounster, where
when he had taken an account of all their dooings and seruices, he established capteine
<note place="marg">The lord deputie establisheth capteine Zouch gouernour of all Mounster.</note>
Zouch to be gouernour of all Mounster, and generall at armes; and then his
lordship returned through Conagh vnto Dublin. This now new gouernor, being
accompanied with capteine Raleigh and capteine Dowdall, trauelled from place to
place to see all things in good order: but the certeine place of their resting was
at Corke, where for the most part they laie in garison: making in the meane time
sundrie iorneies, as occasion of seruice did require. And they being in Corke,
newes was brought vnto the gouernour that there was a great quarell fallen out
<note place="marg">The L. Barrie and the seneschall fall out.</note>
betw&eacute;ene Dauid Barrie and the seneschall, and that they were mortall enimies, and
at a deadlie food; and they laie both in Dunfrinnen side, not far from the blacke
water. The earle of Desmond and Iohn his brother laie in Patrike Condons countrie,
being on the further side of the said water, who were verie sorie for this quarell,
and would haue come vnto them, but the waters were so great, they could not; yet
they sent their messengers to and fro among them for some pacification, but it was
to no effect. Capteine Dowdall vpon these newes sent out an Irish man which he
<note place="marg">Capteine Dowdall maketh a spiall vpon the seneschall.</note>
had, and who was a notable spiall, named Richard mac Iames, and willed him to
s&eacute;eke out where the seneschall was, to the end that he might make a draught vpon
him. This Richard drawing himselfe to the companies of the rebels, and lieng among
them in their cabins where they laie in the woods, he fell in companie, and then entred
into a great familiaritie of one which was a messenger from the Desmonds vnto
the seneschall, and he thinking nothing but that this Richard was one of the said
companie, began to discourse vnto him the businesse which he had there to doo: and
told him that the next daie following, sir Iohn of Desmond did appoint to come
thither, and to make a peace and an agr&eacute;ement betw&eacute;ene Barrie and the seneschall.
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn of Desmond appointed to make a league betw&eacute;en Barrie and the seneschall.</note>
When as Richard mac Iames had heard at full all his sp&eacute;eches, then he intreated him
that he would go to Corke with him, which in the end the fellow was contented so
to doo. And in the next morning they went togither to Corke, and at their comming
thither, did declare vnto capteine Dowdall the whole matter, and he foorthwith
aduertised the same to the gouernour: who albeit he did not altogither bel&eacute;eue
what was told, yet he agr&eacute;ed that it was best that some seruice should be doone
<note place="marg">The gouernor Zouch and captein Dowdall make a secret iourneie.</note>
vpon them, and concluded that himselfe and capteine Dowdall should doo the
same, vnder the colour that they were to make a iourneie vnto Limerike, and so
they caused it to be said: for in no wise would they be knowne of that which they
had determined. And hauing prepared all things necessarie for this seruice, the
same night they left the charge of the garison vnto capteine Raleigh lieutenant:

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"and"</fw>-->

<!--<fw place="top-left">"446"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>-->


and themselues taking their leaue, as though they were bound for Limerike, they
marched out at the gates, and by breake of the daie they came to castell Lions,
the weather being verie mistie and thicke, and in the castell they found but
one poore man, who told them that Dauid of Barrie was gone but a little before
them vnto Humacquilliam. The gouernour and the capteine being verie eger,
and desirous to doo some seruice, they followed the tract of the horsse a good
prettie waie; but the capteine mistrusting that no good seruice would be doone,
that waie, persuaded the gouernour that he should rather enter and search the
woods, which were fast by, where as he thought some good seruice would be doone
whose aduise the gouernour followed: and they had ridden but a little waie, but
they saw two horssemen come riding toward them, but as soone as they had s&eacute;ene
the said gouernour and capteine, they returned backe againe.</p>
<p>Then the capteine told him that there was a bog in the wood, and his aduise and
counsell was, that some of his shot should be sent to stand betw&eacute;ene the bog and the
wood; which being doone, they followed those two men so short, that they were
driuen to forsake their horsses, and to run on foot towards the bog. But the lose shot
being in a readinesse, did put them backe againe vpon the horssemen, who gaue the
onset vpon them; and the one of them, which was sir Iohn of Desmond they sore
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn of Desmond killed, and his bodie hanged vpon a gibbet by the h&eacute;els.</note>
hurted with a horssemans staffe, that he spake verie few words after. And the
other, whose name was Iames Fitziohn of Strongecullie, they tooke: and both they
caried with them to Corke. Sir Iohns head was sent to Dublin, but his bodie was
hanged vp by the h&eacute;eles vpon a gibbet, and set vpon the north gate of Corke. And
Iames Fitziohn was drawne, hanged, &amp; quartered. And thus haue you the third
head of the venemous Hydra cut off, who had his iust reward and merit, if not too
too good for so villanous &amp; bloudie a traitor: who respecting neither the honor of
God, the obedience to his prince, the credit of his owne house, the faith to his
friend, nor the state of the commonwealth, was wholie imbrued in bloud and
villanie; and in bloud he died, and had his reward by Gods iust iudgement.</p>
<p>Not long after this, it was agreed that a draught should be made vpon Dauid
Barrie, for the preie which he and Goren mae Swene had made in Carbreie, and
passed with the same by Bentrie, where laie a garrison vnder the leading of capteine
Appesleie: but he being deceassed, the same was committed to captein Fenton,
whose lieutenant named Richard Cant, minding to crosse the preie, fell into
the fight with Barrie and his companie: but he was slaine and all his companie,
there being but one man the drumsiager left aliue, who by swiftnesse of his foote
escaped. The foresaid Appesleie was a verie proper man, a gentleman borne, and
of a good house, and brought vp in learning; he could write verie well, and also
deliuer his speeches verie orderlie and eloquentlie. When he grew to some ripe
yeares, he fell acquainted with some lose companions, who persuaded him to accompanie
them to the seas, promising him the sun and the moone, and all the wealth
in the world. And he being soone intised and persuaded, was contented, and went
to the seas, and became as bad as the baddest; whereof great troubles insued, and
he at length was driuen to leaue the seas, and to wander a long time on the seacoasts
in the prouince of Mounster: where by occasion he feil to come to acquaintance
of the earle of Desmond, with whome he found such fauor, that no
Englishman could doo more with him than he could. Afterwards, when the narrow
searching for him was quailed and forgotten, he fell to be acquainted with the
good Henrie Dauels, whome he found rather a father than a friend vnto him: and
then his behauiour was such, that he grew to be in good fauour with all Englishmen,
and in the end put in trust to doo sundrie seruices in Mounster, and was become
and made a capteine, in which office he discharged himselfe verie honestlie and

faithfullie. The gouernor continuing still in one and the same mind, to doo some

seruice vpon Barrie, who then laie in Dunfrennin, he togither with capteine Dowdail
marched to Barries campe, and earlie in the morning (they being vnlooked for)
entred into the campe and there made a great slaughter vpon Barries men, but Barrie
himselfe was gone and fled. After this time, the said Barrie considered his distressed
case, and how continuallie he was pursued and followed by the gouernour and
the English garisons, whose force he saw that he could by no means auoid, but that
at one time or other they would take him at some aduantage. He maketh humble
petition to the gouernour that he might be vnder his protection, and to line thensefoorth
<note place="marg">Barrie sueth for a protection.</note>
in some dutifull and restfull order; which he in the end did obteine.</p>
<p>The lord deputie, thinking that by the death of Iohn of Desmond, and the silence
of the earle his brother, who what was become of him no man could tell, but supposed
that he was fled beyond the seas, or that he was dead, and that all things were well
and in quiet in all Mounster; he thought good to ease hir maiesties charge, and so
<note place="marg">The L. deputie casheth sundrie bands in Mounster.</note>
cashed sundrie bands and discharged sundrie garisons, leauing for the seruice of
Mounster in the whole but 400 footmen &amp; 50 horsemen, of which, 200 were vnder
the leading of the gouernor, one hundred vnder capteine Dowdall, and one hundred
vnder Sir George Bourcher; and the first horssemen were vnder capteine Achin,
who laie in garrison at Adare in Kerrie. When all things (I saie) s&eacute;emed to be at
rest and in peace, and all things well behold a new stirre (and vnlooked for) is now
raised: for Fitzmoris baron of Lexua who had hitherto dissembled the matter, and
<note place="marg">Fitzmoris baron of Lexna breaketh into open rebellion. The cause of this his breaking out, some do impute it to the hard dealing of the gouernor, who so narowlie watched him, that he alwais took from him what he had, and so intercepted him from his prouision, that he had nothing left to eat.</note>

<note place="marg">Fitzmoris seruant to Carew lord of Lexna killeth his maister.</note>
pretended to haue b&eacute;ene a dutifull subiect, when he saw the weaknesse of the Eng
lishmen &amp; how that the garrisons were discharged, &amp; therefore the few men left
were scarse able well to saue and k&eacute;epe themselues, much lesse to hurt others: he
breaketh out into open rebellion, and ioineth with him his wicked, traitorous, and
perinred sonne. This baron of Lexna his first ancestors were seruants to the barons
of Carew, and of Odron, and lords of Lexna, and had the chiefe rule and gouernment
vnder him of all his countrie in Mounster, which was verie great and large: his
eldest sonne he kept in the court of England. And this Fitzmoris, who by the authoritie
vnder his master was growen into great credit in the countrie, and standing
in hope to haue their fiiendship and assistance in all his businesse, watched his time,
and killed the lord Carew his maister, at a table which yet remaineth in the house,
and entred into all his baronie of Lexna &amp; his other possessions in Mounster, euen as
the like was doone by the Kauenaghs in Odron in Leinster. And the heire of Carew
in England, who had great and large possessions in Deuon and in sundrie shires
elsewhere in England, made the lesse and little account of his lands in Ireland, and
so by little and little they lost all their lands in Ireland.</p>
<p>This new baron of Lexna, the first thing that he tooke in hand, was to cleanse and
<note place="marg">The baron of Lexna destroieth all the English in his countrie, and taketh the queenes forts.</note>
to rid his owne countrie from all Englishmen and their garrisons; and in the end,
taking capteine Achin at an aduantage, slue him, and recouered the ward of Adare.
After that, he went to the ward kept in the castell of Lesconile, in which were but
eight Englishmen, and the castell being verie hard to be gained, he vsed this stratagem.
He laid verie close &amp; tectlie a companie of his men in an old house fast by
the castell, &amp; then he practised with an old woman, which was woont euerie morning
to bring a great basket of coles or turffe into the ward, that as soone as she was betw&eacute;ene
the two gates of the castell, she should let fall hir basket and crie out: which
<note place="marg">A stratagem vsed in taking the castell of Lesconile.</note>
she did. For when she was come to the castell, and had after hir accustomable
manet called to the ward, one of them came and loosed the vtter iron doore, and
then he did open the inner doore for hir to come in. When she was come betw&eacute;ene
the two doores, she let fall hir great basket of coles and cried out. The companie
foorthwith lieng in the said old house came, and the ward being not able to draw vnto

<!--<fw place="top-left">"448"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>-->


them the vtter iron doore, nor to shut fast the inner doore, the enimie entred, tooke
the castell, killed all the ward, and cast them ouer the wals. The good successe of
this stratagem caused him to practise &amp; to put in vse other like deuises for the regaining
of the castell (as I remember) of Adnagh. For he supposing that hungrie
<note place="marg">A stratagem at Adnagh.</note>
soldiors would be contented to accept anie courtesie, he procured a yoong harlot,
who was somewhat snowtfaire, to go to the castell, pretending some iniurie to haue
b&eacute;ene doone to hir, and to humble hirselfe to the capteins deuotion, being supposed,
that he by these meanes would fall into the liking and fantasieng of hir, and so
would reteine hir. And by these meanes, she by hir cunning handling of the
matter, according vnto the plot before contriued betw&eacute;ene Fitzmoris and hir, she
should at one time or other find the occasion or opportunitie to betraie the castell.
The capteine receiued hir into the castell, and not forgetting the late former practise
at Lesconile, caused him to be the more warie and circumspect, and to looke
vnto himselfe. Wherevpon he so handled the matter with this harlot, that he in the
end found out all the deuise, and foorthwith he carried hir vp vnto the top of the
castell and cast hir ouer the wals, where with the fall she was crushed and died.
Fitzmoris being disappointed of his purpose, departed from thense, and ranged ouer
all the countries of Tipporarie, Ormond, and Waterford, where were no garrisons
to resist him, and there plaied his parts.</p>
<p>The gouernor, who laie at Corke, being aduertised of these outrages, called his
companie togither, which (as is before said, was not aboue foure hundred persons)
and other reported (but vntrulie) to be about foure thousand: yet minding not to
suffer an iniurie, marched with such companie as he had into Clanmoris, which is the
<note place="marg">The gouernor marcheth from Corke to Clanmoris to incounter with Fitzmoris.</note>
said Fitzmoris countrie, and distant from Corke about thr&eacute;e daies iourneie. The
baron by his espials being aduertised of their comming, forsooke his castell at Adare,
and defaced his castell at Lexna, and drew his goods, and all his forces into the wood
of Lesconile. When the gouernor was come to Adare, he found the towne burnt,
and the few Englishmen (which were in the abbeie) greatlie distressed. From thense
he went to Lesconile, which is ten miles further, where he discouered the baron and
all his companie, which then laie in a plaine bottome in the said wood, hauing then
in his companie of gallowglasses, kerne, shot, and horssemen, about seuen hundred
men.</p>
<p>The gouernor taking aduise what was best to be doone, because that place was
full of fastnesse, and no passage for anie horssemen, but all rested vpon the seruice
of the footmen; they diuided their companie. And capteine Dowdall being verie
<note place="marg">Capteine Dowdall entereth vpon Fitzmoris, and giueth him the foile.</note>

<note place="marg">The baron of Lexna fl&eacute;eth into the hils of Sloughlougher.</note>
desirous to aduenture the seruice vpon him, he had six score footmen appointed
and deliuered vnto him, and the residue he reserued to himselfe. The capteine
entred into the wood, and followed vntill he came into the plains where Fitzmoris
was; who hauing a great companie, and the capteine but (as it were) a handfull to
his, he diuided his whole companie into foure parts, thinking to haue inclosed the
capteine and to haue his will vpon them. The capteine perceiued it, and forthwith
brake vpon one of the companies, and had such a hand vpon them, that he slue a
number of them. Which when Fitzmoris saw, like a valiant man turned his backe
and fled awaie into the mounteins of Sloughlougher, and left all his goods behind;
which the capteine tooke, and also all the cattell there, and brought the same to the
gouernor. From thense they marched to the castell of Clan, of which Oliuer Stephanson
had the ward and k&eacute;eping: and there newes was brought vnto him, that the
lord deputie had sent vnto him two bands of footmen, of which one hundred were
<note place="marg">A supplie of two hundred men sent to the gouernor.</note>
sir Henrie Wallops, and the other capteine Norris. Wherevpon he trauelled vnto
Limerike, and left the whole charge of Clanmoris, and of Kerrie vnto capteine
Dowdall. And the said capteine being put to w&eacute;et that the baron was incamped

<note place="marg">Capteine Dowdall setteth vpon Fitzmoris in Glanflish and giueth him the ouerthrow.</note>
shot, and thirtie horssemen, and he himselffe hauing then but the lieutenant
Wingfield in his companie, made a sallie vpon them, and killed with the sword, and
drane into the riuer aboue seuen score of them, and recouered a preie of eight hundred
kine, fiue hundred horsses and mares, besides a great number of sh&eacute;epe and
gotes: and in the taking of the baron, he found store of monie and plate, and massing
garments. And from hense he marched with his cattell, and incamped besides
Alough, n&eacute;ere vnto the earle of Clanear his house, and from thense to Castelimange,
and so to Adare, and furnished as he went cuerie ward and garison with store of vittels,
<note place="marg">The baron Fitzmoris with a few is ouerthrowne to his vtter fall, and forsaken of all his fr&eacute;ends.</note>
and with the goods he rewarded his souldiors. From this time, the baron
Fitzmoris hauing lost all his prouision &amp; store, was neuer able to recouer himselfe,
neither to credit nor to wealth, nor yet to hold vp his head, but was forsaken of all,
his fr&eacute;ends and followers: and being ashamed of himselfe, and of his bad and disloiall
trecheries, walked and wandred abroad as a forlorne man, not knowing what
to doo, whither to go, or where to s&eacute;eke for succor and helpe.</p>
<p>At length being wearie of himselfe, and of his distressed miseries, bethinketh
<note place="marg">The baron being distressed of all helps, s&eacute;eketh to the earle of Ormond for a protection.</note>
vpon the earle of Ormond, whome notwithstanding that without cause he had verie
much iniured, hauing most outragiouslie preied his countries, burned his villages,
and killed his people: yet he maketh his recourse vnto his lordship, acknowledgeth
his fault, confesseth his follies; and being most sorie for the same, desireth his lordship
to pardon and remit him, and most humblie requested him to haue vnder him a
protection. This honorable man, notwithstanding the great iniuries doone vnto
<note place="marg">The courtesie of the earle of Ormond.</note>
him, and he of a great courage and stomach, and of a noble mind, and 10th to put vp
so great iniuries, yet (as it is attributed to the lion, <emph>Parcere prostratis</emph>) when he had
shewed the great gr&eacute;efes of the said Fitzmoris, he forgat all his owne wrongs, and
granted him his request. Capteine Dowdall, leauing the gouernors souldiors and
companie at Adare, vnder the leading of capteine Smith, he marcheth towards Corke,
where he rested and laie in garrison. Now when all these broils were ended, and
verelie supposed that all things had b&eacute;ene at rest, and the whole prouince of Mounster
at peace; behold the earle of Desmond, who was thought to be either dead or fled, beginneth
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond thought to be dead dooth now shew himselfe.</note>

<note place="marg">The fight at Adare.</note>
to appeare, and to shew himselfe; and hauing assembled a great companie,
came to Adare, where the garrison issued out vpon him: betw&eacute;ene whom the fight
was hot, and manie slaine on both sides. Among whom, Smith serjeant of the band,
and Morgan the lieutenant were both slaine: but yet the English souldiors recouered
the abbeie. About this time one Thomas Birne lieutenant to the notable archtraitor
Fitzgirald, being wearie of the wicked actions which hitherto he had followed
<note place="marg">A draught made to kill Fitzgirald.</note>
among the rebels, sent his messenger to capteine George Carew, requesting him
to deale with the lord deputie for his pardon, and for so manie of his companie as
would ioine with and accompanie him in a p&eacute;ece of seruice to be doone: which he
promised to recompense with the price of his capteins head, which he would in a
bag present to his lordship, as also would kill so manie of his companie as would
not consent with him therevnto.</p>
<p>When this deuise was readie to be practised, the clearke of the band, who was
<note place="marg">Fitzgirald executed to death so manie as conspired against him.</note>
one of the confederats, verie trecherouslie did discouer the same vnto Fitzgirald,
who immediatlie tooke and hanged his lieutenant, the sergeant of his band (who
was an Englishman) and so manie of the souldiors as were of that confederacie.
Not long after, Fitzgirald bethinking vpon the extreame miseries, which in this
rebellion he had indured, and the small hope which he had to preuaile in these his

bad and traitorous actions, but chieffie being afraid of his owne life, least at one time
or other he should be slaine by his souldiors: he sent a messenger to the then lord

the practise, and he foorthwith intreated Fitzgirald in the like manner as he before
had doone with the lieutenant, and so hanged him vp. The lord deputie after

<note place="marg">The lord Greie y&eacute;eldeth vp the sword &amp; returneth into England.</note>

<note place="marg"><date>1582</date></note>

<note place="marg">The lord chancellor and sir Henrie Wallop are lord justices.</note>
he sent for capteine Zouch gouernor of Mounster to come to Dubline: and in the
end of August 1582, after that he had serued full two yeres he deliuered vp the
sword vnto the archbishop of Dubline then lord chancellor, and to sir Henrie Wallop
then treasuror at armes, and tooke shipping; hauing with him capteine Zouch,
who was after slaine by one of his most familiar acquaintance, and sundrie other
gentlemen. The said lord Greie was a man of great nobilitie, and of as honourable and
ancient descent, one that feareth God in true religion, and dutifull to hir maiestie
in all obedience. And albeit he had deserued well of that Irish nation, and had
sowed the good seeds of notable seruices, as well for his martiall seruices, as
for his ciuill gouernment; yet he reped (as his predecessors before him) but darnell
and cockle. For they had among them not onelie conspired his death, for which
some paid d&eacute;erelie; but made also sundrie complaints against him, to which he answered
to his commendation and acquitall, and to their reproch for their ingratitude.</p>
<p>These
two lords iustices being fallen into a broken time, the warres being not
ended, the people not quieted, and the gouernement not staied nor setled; yet they
both ioining their wisedoms, seruices, and good wils, were so blessed therein, that
by them that land was reduced to some perfection and quietnesse. For not long
after they had taken the sword in hand doctor Sanders the popes nuncio and legat,
who came from that holie s&eacute;e of Rome, the sea of all wickednesse, with Iames Fitzmoris
in Iulie in the yeare of our Lord one thousand fiue hundred seuentie and nine,
to beare arms in this land against hir maiestie, after that he had wandered vp and
downe thr&eacute;e yeares togither with the earle and his brethren sir Iohn, in woods and
bogs, and had liued with them a most miserable and wretched life and had b&eacute;ene
partaker of their most cruell bloudsheds, outrages, murthers, and robberies, a life
<note place="marg">The death of doctor Sanders.</note>
good and too good for a traitor and a rebell. He fell sicke of an Irish ague and of
the bloudie flix, and laie in the wood of Clennelisse, which is a wood full of allers,
withies, briers, &amp; thornes, and through which is no passage; where partlie of his
sicknesse, but ch&eacute;efelie for famine and want he died. Euen in this filthie place, that
most miserable wretch and traitor was lodged and died, bequeathing his treasons,
treacheries, and disloialties against his souereigne mistresse and ladie hir maiestie
vnto the pope, reseruing the punishment to the Lord himselfe, who is a swift and
iust iudge vpon all traitors and disobedient persons, and his bodie (as some
saie) was deuoured vp of woolues, but (as some doo thinke) that so much as was left
was buried at Clancarne, not farre off from the place where he died.</p>
<p>The two lords iustices being entred into this broken gouernement, did what they
could to k&eacute;epe the same in peace; and vnderstanding the wilfull disposition of Desmond,
they did vse all the means and waies they could to pacifie him; but so farre
was he imbrued and poisoned with the venom of treason and rebellion, that no
reason, no dutie, nor anie other respect could persuade him to be a loiall and dutifull
subiect. Wherefore he continued still in his old accustomed spoiling and
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond k&eacute;epeth his Christmas in the woods.</note>
wasting the countries, and trusting to no house nor castell, did shrowd himselfe in
woods and bogs, and in the winter following he kept his Christmasse in the wood
of Kilquieg n&eacute;ere to Kilmallocke. And about the fourth of Ianuarie then following,
one Iohn Welsh a valiant and a good souldior, was resolued to make a draught vpon

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"the"</fw>-->


<pb n="451"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"451"</fw>-->


the said earle, and he made acquainted therewith capteine Dowdall, capteine Bangor,
<note place="marg">A draught made vpon the earle by Iohn Welsh.</note>
and George Thorington prouost marshall of Mounster, all which laie then in
garrison in Kilmallocke, and according to the order betweene them then agr&eacute;ed
vpon, they marched in the night time to the place and wood where the earle laie.</p>
<p>But being come thither, they were to passe ouer a great riuer, before they could
come to enter into the wood of Kilquieg, &amp; by reason of the great raines then falling,
it was impossible for man or horsse to passe ouer the same, which thing Iohn Welsh
did before mistrust. Wherefore the night before, he went thither verie closelie, with
such few persons as he had chosen for the purpose: and there he caused a number of
<note place="marg">A deuise how to passe ouer a great riuer.</note>
flakes and hurdels to be made of halson, allers, and withie rods, which he caused to be
drawne ouer the riuer by one, whom he had there of purpose which could swim verie
well. And this fellow when he had fastened some of the hurdels to a tree in the further
side of the water, and then by a rope drew ouer the residue one after another, did
so fasten and tie one vnto another, and so cunninglie handled the matter, that when
the capteins came, they passed ouer the riuer verie well without danger or perill.
And so from thense the said Welsh did guide and bring them by the breake of the
daie vnto the earles cabin: but the wood was so full of thickets, and so mirie, that
<note place="marg">The earle escapeth verie hardlie.</note>
they were faine to go a speares length wide from the cabin to come vnto it. The earle
hearing a great noise, and suspecting some extraordinarie and a greater companie to be
in place more than his owne, and doubting the woorst, can out of his bed in his shirt,
and ran into the riuer fast by his cabin, and there hid himselfe close vnder a banke
hard vp to his chin, by which meanes he escaped and his wife with him. The
souldiors made diligent search for him both by searching of the riuer and of the wood,
but could not find him; wherevpon they did put to the sword so manie as they
found there, and carried awaie the goods with them, and so returned to Kilmallocke.</p>
<p>At this time the seneschall secretlie with all the force which he could make,
came vnto the towne of Youghall, &amp; entred into the end of the same towne.
<note place="marg">The seneschall assaul teth &amp; entreth into Youghall and hath the repulse.</note>
Wherevpon the alarum was raised, and foorthwith Caluerleigh being lieutenant to
capteine Morgan, hauing all his soldiors togither, of which he had fortie shot, went
vnto that end of the towne where the seneschall scaled the wals, &amp; there he made a
sconse, or a little bulworke, and by that meanes saued the towne, and draue the
seneschall from his purpose, and killed aboue fiftie of his men: and so being disappointed
of his purpose he departed awaie. In the end of this moneth of Ianuarie
the earle of Ormond arriued from out of England to Waterford with a new supplie
of foure hundred men, whome he diuided and committed vnto the seuerall leadings
<note place="marg">The earle of Ormond arriueth to Waterford and is generall of Mounster.</note>
of sir George Bourcher, sir William Stanleie, capteine Edward Berkleie, and capteine
Roberts. And being now lord generall by hir maiesties appointment
ouer all Mounster, and hauing obteined an augmentation of two pence by the daie
for euerie soldiors wages, he assembleth all the soldiors and euerie capteine which
had anie charge, and tooke order with euerie of them for such seruices as were to be
doone, furnisheth them with vittels, munitions, monie, and all things necessarie and
meet for them, requesting euerie one of them to shew themselues like good and
valiant soldiors, in the pursuing of the rebels, and vanquishing of the enimies: and
such grace and loue he found among the soldiors, that he was no more desirous than
they most glad and willing to performe the same. Such a good affection euerie one
<note place="marg">The loue of the capteins and soldiors to the earle of Ormond.</note>
did beare to this honorable man.</p>
<p>At this time aduertisement was giuen vnto his lordship, that the earle of Desmond
was incamped in the fastnesse of Harlo wood with a great number of rakehels &amp;
rebels. His lordship mustered all his companies, and minding to doo some seruice
vpon the said rebels, marcheth towards the said fastnesse of Harlo wood. And

being come thither, he diuideth his companies into foure parts, and they entered
<note place="marg">The lord general scowreth Harlo wood.</note>
into foure seuerall places of the wood at one instant: and by that meanes they
scowred the wood throughout, in killing as manie as they tooke, but the residue
fled into the mounteins. The rebels being thus narrowlie followed and pursued,
they neuer after met togither in the like companies, nor assembled themselues in such
great numbers: but the most part of them, which were the chiefest followers and
<note place="marg">Desmond is forraken of all his followers and fr&eacute;ends.</note>
greatest fr&eacute;ends vnto Desmond, as Fitzmoris of Lexna before named, the seneschall,
the lord Barrie, Condon, Donnell mac Knought, &amp; sundrie others, some and some
came awaie, and sought for protection. And albeit their manifold and infinit outrages,
murthers, bloudsheds and spoiles, had deserued a thousand deaths: yet his
lordship considering their repentance, sorrows, and humble submissions, and respecting
more hir maiesties godlie disposition to mercie than their deserts, did (for the
most part) grant vnto euerie of them their requests. The soldiors after this p&eacute;ece of
seruice were dispersed abroad into their seuerall garrisons. And albeit the greater
parts of the rebels were some by sword, and some by protection abated, and much
decreased, yet none of them laie altogither idle, but did follow the seruice as time
and occasion offered. For the earle himselfe, though he were thus unfeathered of
his greatest helps, yet he was one &amp; the same man, a most ranke traitor and rebell:
and therefore vpon him dailie were draughts and pursutes made, and neuer left, vntill
in the end he came vnto confusion.</p>
<p>In the moneth of August, in the yeare of Christ one thousand fiue hundred
eightie and thr&eacute;e, it was aduertised to the garrisons in Kilmallocke and Cashell,
that the erle of Desmond was come againe to harborough himselfe in Harlo
wood, and had aboue three score gallowglasses besides kerne a great number,
<note place="marg">A draught made vpon the gallowglasses in Harlo wood.</note>
vpon whom captein Dowdall hauing good espials, made a iorneie thither, and being
entred into the wood verie earlie, laie close all the forenoone. For these gallowglasses
had bin so dared from time to time, that now like a sort of deere they laie
vpon their k&eacute;epings; and so fearfull they were, that they would not tarrie in anie one
place anie long time, but where they did dresse their meat, thense they would remoone,
and eat it in another place, and from thense go vnto another place to lie.
In the nights they would watch, in the forenoones they would be vpon the hilles
and mounteins, to deserie the countrie, and in the afternoone they would sl&eacute;epe.
The capteine breaking time with them, made staie in the wood accordinglie, and
in the afternoone he learned by his espials, that they were returned from the mounteius,
and were entred into their cabins, where some of them were asl&eacute;epe, and some
of them occupied in dressing of a horsse for to eat, for other vittels were scant. The
capteine suddenlie entred vpon them, and tooke them at such aduantage, that they
were all, for the most part, put to the sword: of which, fiue and twentie were taken
<note place="marg">The gallowglasses in Harlo wood put to sword.</note>
in their cabins. After the dispatch of these Gallowglasses, which are counted
the best men of warre among the Irishrie: the residue of the Irish rebels were
so dismaid, that a man might without anie great danger passe throughout
Mounster.</p>
<p>About a moneth after this, in September, in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred
foure score &amp; three, it hapned that certeine of the lord Roches men, being in Dowall
n&eacute;ere to Trusham, were riding about certeine businesse, and met with the earle of
<note place="marg">The L. Roch his men discouer Desmond.</note>
Desmond, hauing in his companie two or three horsemen and a priest. The
kerns which attended the said lord Roches men, inuironed &amp; compassed them
about; but the earle and his men being well horssed, escaped, onelie the priest they
tooke, by reason of his bad horsse, and him the lord Roch sent the next daie vnto
the lord gouernour, and being examined, he confessed in what great distresse and

miserie the erle was, and that for feare he lurked in corners, &amp; would not be s&eacute;ene.
And further, that he had his onelie rel&eacute;efe and was fostered by Goron mac Swene,
<note place="marg">The Desmond is rel&eacute;ened by Goron mac Swene.</note>
a capteine of the gallowglasses, and who was then vnder protection. And by these
meanes, the erle (who had not b&eacute;ene heard of since he was garred out of Harlo
wood) is now discouered. Wherevpon the lord generall commanded a barke to be
foorthwith vittelled, and to be dispatched into Dingle a Cush: and foorthwith commanded
<note place="marg">A garison appointed to be at the Dingle.</note>
capteine Dowdall to repaire thither, and there to lie in garison; which he
did foorthwith performe. The earle of Desmond when he heard how that he was discouered,
and how that vittels and a garison were seut to Dingle a Cush to the working
of his wo; he was assured that he should be surelie pursued by capteine Dowdall,
<note place="marg">Desmond feareth Dowdall.</note>
who of all other capteines and sir George Bourchier did from time to time
gall and most earnestlie pursue him. Wherefore now as for his last helpe, by the
helpe and friendship of Goron mac Swene, &amp; Moile Morough mac Sweue his brother,
he gathereth a new companie, and maketh himselfe as strong as he can, and getteth
himselfe into Desmond, and there standeth vpon his gard. Goron mac Swene in
<note place="marg">Goron preith all Carberie for Desmond.</note>
the meane time entreth into Carberie, and taketh a great preie of kine, which he
droue foorthwith into Desmond toward the earle, but the iorneie was so long, that
he laie short of th&eacute; earle that night about thr&eacute;e or foure miles.</p>
<p>The men of the countrie, who had thus lost their goods, thr&eacute;e of them with their
swords and targets followed the tract a far off, minding to haue stollen awaic their
owne kine if by anie means they could, and if opportunitie would so serue; for by
force or by intreatie they knew it to be impossible for them to recouer anie thing at
all. The foresaid Goron, when he had lodged himselfe for all night, it was his pleasure
to walke abrode in the fields; and suspecting no harme, went alone, hauing
onelie one kerne with him (and both without weapon) about ten or twelue score off
from his lodging. About which place it hapned the foresaid thr&eacute;e men had hidden
and couched themselues in a bush, and taking the occasion offered, they went also
betw&eacute;ene him and his lodging, and fell vpon him and his kerne, &amp; killed them both:
<note place="marg">Goron mac Swene is killed.</note>
and as soone as they had cut off their heads, they shifted for themselues. Gorons
companie, finding their maister lacking, went abrode to s&eacute;eke him, and in the end
found him and his man without heads, lieng dead vpon the ground; which cast them
into such a maze, as they wist not what to thinke or to doo: neither could they imagine
nor deuise how this should come to passe: for garison there was none in those
parts, and they knew of no person thereabouts whome they could suspect. But this
is the iust iudgement of God, who in his iustice looketh vpon the periured and wicked,
and in mercie beholdeth his seruants. For if this man had liued, it was feared that
by his means the earle would haue increased a new force, and haue dighted the lord
gouernour and all the garisons to greater troubles. The erle being aduertised of the
losse of this his friend, his ch&eacute;efe and onelie staie, was in a great agonie, and maruellouslie
dismaid; and s&eacute;eing no other remedie, he prepareth the best for himselfe,
and taking the aduantage of the time, before the garison should be placed at the
Dingle, he made a draught into Kerrie n&eacute;ere Traileigh, minding to take a prie
<note place="marg">The erle commandeth preie to be taken in Kerrie.</note>
from such as had forsaken him and had receiued their protections. Wherfore in the
evening he sent two horssemen with a certeine kerne ouer the strand of Traleigh
vnto a castell there, &amp; commanded them to take their preie from thense, which they
did, and brought the same awaie with them.</p>
<p>Among those kine thus driuen awaie, a poore woman of that countrie lost all
those few that she had, and being distressed of that which was the cheefe, and in a
maner the onelie rel&eacute;efe of hir and hir children and houshold; and not knowing how
she could by anie meanes recouer them: she bethought hir selfe vpon a brother which

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"she"</fw>-->


<pb n="454"/>

<!--<fw place="top-left">"454"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE CHRONICLES OF IRELAND."</fw>-->


she had, dwelling on the other side of the mounteine, in a castell named Drome,
which was one of the Morettos; and to him she runneth in all the hast she could,
and declareth hir estate and case, praieng him to helpe hir, and that he would follow,
the tract for the recouerie of hir kine. Who when he was aduertised that there
were but two horssemen &amp; a few kerne which had drouen the preie awaie, he to
pleasure his sister tooke three other of his brethren, and followed the tract, till he came
to Castelmange, which castell was in the waie. And when he came thither, he went
to the castell, and desired the constable (whose name was Cheston, and not long
before lieutenant to capteine Berkeleie) that he would spare him some shot and a
few of his kerne to helpe him to follow the preie which was driuen that waie. The
constable and the soldiors were verie glad to pleasure him, and so he had seuen shot
and a doozzen of kerne which dwelled in an out house fast vnder the castell, &amp; so they
went altogither to Traleigh, they being in number three and twentie persons; one
of these was an Irish man borne, named Kollie, but serued alwaies vnder Englishmen,
and could speake verie good English. This man, when they came to Traleigh, they
appointed &amp; made him their leader or capteine; and Moretto because he was borne
in those parties, and best knew the countrie, they appointed to be their guide: and
from thense they followed the tract vntill they came to the side of a mounteine, where
there was a glan, and in it a little groue of wood: and the night being come vpon
them, there they staid and rested themselues for that night. And in the darke night
one of them had espied through the tr&eacute;es a fire not farre off, where vpon they drew
themselues close together, and caused one of themselues closelie and secretlie to
draw towards the fire and to discouer what companie was there, and how manie was
of them; which man did so. And when he returned backe vnto them, he told them
that there was an old bad house, and about fiue or six persons therein: wherevpon
they all determined and agreed to repaire to that place to know the whole matter.
Moretto was the guide to bring them to the house, and Kollie did set his companie
in order and good araie, as was most for their seruice, if n&eacute;ed should so require.
And when they were come to the house, they found in it but onelie one old man,
for the residue were gone. Then Kollie drew his sword and strake the old man, with
which blow he had almost cut off one of his arms; and then he strake him againe,
and gaue him a great blow on the side of his head; wherwith the said old man cried
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond taken in an old house alone and slaine.</note>
out, desiring them to saue his life, for he was earle of Desmond, and then Kollie
staied his hands: but the erle bled so fast, that he waxed verie faint, and could not
trauell anie further: wherevpon the said Kollie bid and willed him to prepare himselfe
to die; and then he strake off the earls head.</p>
<p>The residue of the companie in this meane time spoiled and rifled the house, and
tooke what them listed: and then they all departed and went to Castelmange, and
carried the earles head with them, but left the bodie behind; and whether the same
were deuoured by the woolues or buried by his kerne, it is not certeinlie knowne.
As soone as they came to Castelmange, they sent the said earles head vnto the lord
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmonds head sent into England and put vpon London bridge.</note>
generall, who foorthwith sent the same into England for a present to hir maiestie;
which foorthwith was put vpon a pole, and set on London bridge. When this his
death was noised and knowne, there was no more seruice to be doone: for euerie
rebell east awaie his weapon, and sought all the waies they could to humble themselues
and to become good subiects: sauing one Iohn Bourke, who stood vpon his
<note place="marg">Iohn Bourke hauing a protection, made a stealth, and was killed.</note>
protection, and yet neuerthelesse he and his companie went to Adare, there to haue
taken a preie. But as he passed by the castell, a boie there in discharged his peece
vpon the said Bourke, &amp; strake him in the head, whereof he died. The common
people, who had felt the great smart of this troublesome time, reioised and were glad

of the death of the erle, being in a good hope that the long troubles should haue an
end, and they to be the more at rest. During these continuall troubles in Mounster,
the two lord iustices which laie at Dublin were much eased from all martiall affaires
elsewhere, and were troubled but with the clamorings, exclamations, and brabling
of the Irish people, not woorth the remembring: sauing that a certeine combat was
<note place="marg">A combat betwene two Oconhours.</note>
fought and tried before them in the castell of Dublin, betw&eacute;ene two Oconhours,
verie neere coosens &amp; kinsmen: the one was named Teig mac Guill Patrike Oconhour
appellant; the other was named Con mac Cormake Oconhour defendant. One
of these appealed and charged the other for sundrie treasons in the late rebellion,
and which could haue no other triall but by combat, which was granted vnto them.
Wherevpon, according to the lawes and orders of England for a combat to be tried,
all things were prepared, the daie, time, and place appointed; and according to the
same, the lord iustiees, the iudges, and the councellors came and sat in the place appointed
for the same, euerie man in his degree and calling. And then the court was
<note place="marg">The maner of the combat.</note>
called, and the appellant or plaintife was brought in before the face of the court,
being stripped into his shirt, hauing onlie his sword and target (which were the weapons
appointed) and when he had doone his reuerence and dutie to the lord iustices
and to the court, he was brought to a stoole set in the one of the ends within the
lists, and there sat. After him was the defendant brought in, in the like maner and
order, and with the like weapons: and when he had doone his dutie and reuerence to
the lord iustices and to the court, he was brought to his chaire placed in the other
end of the lists. Then were their actions and pleadings openlie read, and then the
appellant was demanded whether he would auerre his demand or not? who when he
had affirmed that he would, the partie defendant was likewise asked whether he would
confesse the action, or stand to the triall of the same? who did answer as did the
other, that he would auerre it by the swoord.</p>
<p>Upon this their seuerall answers, they were seuerallie called the one after the
other, euerie of them taking a corporall oth that their quarell was true, and that
they would iustifie the same both with sword &amp; blood. Thus they being sworne are
brought backe againe euerie of them to their seuerall places as before. And then
when by the sound of a trumpet a signe was giuen vnto them when they should
enter into the fight; they arose out of their seats, and met ech one the other in the
middle within the lists, and there with the weapons assigned vnto them, they
fought: in which fight the appellant did preuaile, and he not onlie did disarme the
defendant, but also with the sword of the said defendant did cut off his head, and
vpon the point of the same sword did present it to the lord iustices, and so with the
victorie of his enimie he was acquitted. Thus much I thought good to saie somwhat
of much, of the maner of a combat, which together with manie circumstances
therevnto belonging is now for want of vse almost cleane forgotten, and yet verie
necessarie to be knowne. And as for this combat it was so valiantlie doone, that a
great manie did wish that it had rather fallen vpon the whole sex of the Oconhours,
than vpon these two gentlemen.</p>
<p>The vicount of Baltinglas, being aduertised of the death of the earle of Desmond,

which was no small griefe vnto him, and he also verie wearie of his trotting
and wandering on foot amongst bogs, woods, and desert places (being altogither

<note place="marg">The vicount Baltinglasse imbarketh himselfe for Spaine,</note>
and not able to hold head anie longer against hir maiesties force) did imbarke
himselfe for Spaine, in hope to haue some rel&eacute;efe and succor, and to procure some
aid from the king of Spaine; and by that meanes to be of some abilitie to renew his
force and rebellion. But he found in the end verie small comfort. And therefore

of a verie melancholie gr&eacute;efe &amp; sorrow of mind, as it is thought, he died, being in
verie extreame pouertie and need. Not long after this, the two lord iustices, who
had ruled and gouerned the land in these troublesome and broken times in great
wisdome, care, &amp; circumspection, when they had brought the whole land to a
peaceable &amp; quiet gouernment, and deliuered the same from all open or knowne rebellion;
they cashed and discharged all the garrisons in Mounster, onelie two hundred
souldiors excepted: they kept it in good quietnesse, vntill the arriuall of sir
Iohn Perot knight, who was sent ouer to be lord deputie, and landed at Dublin
<note place="marg">Sir Iohn Perot arriueth into Ireland to be lord deputie.</note>
about the middle of Iune, one thousand fiue hundred fourescore and foure, the six
and twentith yeare of hir maiesties reigne vnto whome they deliuered the swoord:
who being entered into his office, begun such a course, that of his good beginnings
a great hope was conceiued of the like to insue. For he was a right woorthie seruitor
in that land, when he was lord president in Mounster: and by whome Iames
Fitzmoris was subdued, and the whole prouince maruellouslie well reformed: whose
notable and most noble acts as they doo well deserue, so when the same shall come
to his full measure, they shall be registred to his perpetuall fame and immortall
honor. And yet in the meane time, it shall not be offensiue to remember some speciall
points of his late seruice, which doo deserue to be remembred: as also for the
incouraging of this noble man to continue the good course which he hath begun;
which doo halson and giue a hope that he will <emph>Addere colophonem,</emph> and bring that
land to a full and perfect gouernment &amp; regiment; which Giraldus Cambrensis
would not warrant could be doone much before doonesdaie.</p>
<p>Not long after the arriuall of this man, the Scots after their accustomed maner,
<note place="marg">The Scots rebell and are subdued.</note>
for a bien venu or welcome to his lordship, they began a rebellion, and are vp in
armes readie for the warre. His lordship hauing notice and knowledge thereof,
maketh himselfe forthwith in a readinesse to m&eacute;ete with them, and to stop them of
their purpose: and therein he so ordered and handled the matter, that the Scots
were driuen to s&eacute;eke peace, to craue pardon, to submit themselues, and to sweare
allegiance, faith, and obedience to hir maiestie. Which when they had obteined,
then they tooke the lands wherein they dwelled, of hir highnesse, y&eacute;elding a yearelie
rent, which before they had not beene accustomed nor woont to dooe. And by
these meanes, if there be any truth in them, the state of that countrie standeth the
better assured.</p>
<p>Then when he was from this seruice returned to Dublin, his speciall care, studie,
and indeuor was to deuise and studie how to reduce and reforme the whole realme
and the gouernment, according to the laws of England. Wherevpon he would and
did verie often assemble the whole councell, or so manie of them as were there, for
their aduise herein; whose names are these. The archbishop of Dublin lord chancellor,
<note place="marg">The councell in Ireland.</note>
the earle of Ormond lord treasuror, the primat of Armagh, the bishop of
Meth, the bishop of Kilmore, sir Iohn Noris lord president of Mounster, sir Henrie
Wallop treasuror at armes, sir Nicholas Bagnoll knight marshall, Robert Gardner
chiefe iustice of the bench, sir Robert Dillon knight chiefe iustice of the common
pl&eacute;es, sir Lucas Dillon knight chiefe baron, sir Nicholas White knight master of the
rols, sir Richard Bingham knight chiefe commissioner in Connagh, sir Henrie Cowleie
knight, sir Edward Waterhouse knight, sir Thomas le Strange knight, Edward
Brabesbie, Geffreie Fenton secretarie, sir Warham Sentleger &amp; sir Valentine Browne
knights; but discontinued. By the good aduise, helpe, and councell of these wise
<note place="marg">The whole realme brought into shire grounds.</note>
and prudent councellors, he first thought it best to bring the whole land into shire
grounds, whereby the laws of England might haue a through course and passage.
Wherefore, what sir Henrie Sidneie before had doone in a few counties, that he per

formed in the whole realme, and brought the same into such &amp; so manie seuerall
counties, as was thought best and most fit for that purpose. To euerie of which new
counties he appointed and assigned seuerall shiriffes, and all such inferior officers as
were most requisit, and to the same incident and apperteining. All and euerie which
shires hitherto not registred, nor published in chronicle, togither with such as tofore
were knowne, I thought it good to set downe by their seuerall names, and in
their prouinces as followeth.</p>

the whole land, and hir maiestie knowne to be souereigne ladie and qu&eacute;ene of the
same. Then the Irishrie by little and little gaue ouer their Brehon laws, and their
Irish vsage, and became obedient vnto the English laws; vnto which they referred
themselues to be tried, and to haue all their quarels to be decided and determined:
whereof at these presents is extant a verie notable president &amp; example betweene
two of the most principall and chiefe personages in the prouince of Vlster. The
one is he, who nameth himselfe Onele, and the other is the earle of Tiron, the heire
to the great Con Onele. These two and their ancestors, and all other noble men in
that prouince, when so euer anie discord or enimitie did fall out among them, they
had no peacemaker but the sword, and by wars and bloudshed was the same decided.
Neuerthelesse, these two noble men leauing to pursue their quarels, as in
<note place="marg">Onele and the earle of Tiron sue each one the other at law.</note>
times past with the sword &amp; in hostile maner, doo refer themselues to the triall of
the laws; and each one of them sueth the other at the common laws, and in the
chancerie in hir maiesties court at Dublin, and there as dutifull subiects doo abide
the triall of their cause. A thing so much the more to be considered, as the parties
be of that nobilitie and stoutnesse; and a thing so rare, as heretofore not heard nor
knowne. Which course if it haue so happie a progresse and successe, as it hath a
good enterance and beginning; no doubt, but that partlie by the laws, and partlie
by the swoord, an vniuersall obedience shall through that land be established, the
common societie shall be preserued, the whole realme shall florish and prosper, hir
maiestie shall be obeied, the reuenues shall be increased; and in the end, peace shall
be vpon Israell. And as this example giueth some manifest good hope thereof, so
the same is confirmed and increased by the happie victorie of late in Connagh;
<note place="marg">Sir Richard Bingham his victorie vpon the Scots.</note>
where a number of Scots, hauing made an inuasion, were met and incountered
withall, by the right worthie sir Richard Bingham knight, chiefe commissioner of
that prouince, and by him they were vanquished &amp; ouerthrowne, to the number of
fifteene hundred persons; so that verie few or none escaped the sword, to returne
home with the news of their successe: but were either killed or drowned.</p>
<p>Thus much hitherto generallie concerning the gouernment of that land of Ireland,
since the death of king Henrie the eight, vntill these presents. In the course of
which time, manie more notable things haue beene doone, worthie to be registred in
the chronicles of perpetuall fame and memorie. For the atteining to the knowledge
whereof, though Iohn Hooker the writer hereof haue b&eacute;ene a diligent traneller and a
searcher for the same; yet he wanted that good successe, as both the historie it selfe
requireth, and he himselfe wisheth. And yet the most part of all the actions in that
age consisted most in continuall warres, rebellions, and hostilitie, either against their
most sacred kings and queenes, or amongst themselues. But whatsoeuer tofore hath
beene doone, none were so tragicall, impious, and vnnaturall, as were the last warres
of the Giraldines of Desmond in Mounster. For of the Giraldines of Kildare, who
were not acquainted, nor consenting to these wicked actions, nothing is meant.
Whereinto who so listeth to looke, and well to consider, he shall find and s&eacute;e most
euident and apparant examples of Gods iustice &amp; iudgement, against such as doo rebell
against the Lords annointed; whome the Lord by his expresse word hath commanded
to be honored and obeied in all humblenesse and dutie: because they are his
vicars, substitutes, and vicegerents vpon the earth, to defend the good, and to
punish the euill; and who so resisteth them, doo resist his ordinances, and shall receiue
hard iudgement, as most manifestlie it dooth appeare in this the earle of Desmonds
rebellion. All which if it should be set downe particularlie, as in course it
fell out, it would be verie tedious: but much more lamentabie and doiefull to be
read.</p>

<p>And therefore leauing the large discourse, it shall suffice to shut and conclude this
historie, with the briefe recitall of the most speciall points, to mooue ech man to consider
the mightie hand of God against traitors and rebels; and his louing mercie and
kindnesse vpon the dutifull and obedient. First therefore Iames Fitzmoris, the first
ringleader in this pageant, and who most vnnaturallie had flocked in strangers and
forreiners to inuade the land, for establishing the antichristian religion, and the depriuing
of hir maiestie from hir imperiall crowne of the realme of Ireland: this man
(I saie) was he who yeelded the first fruits of this rebellion. For in his idolatrous
pilgrimage to the holie crosse, and his traitorous iourneie to practise with all the
rebels and inhabitants in Connagh and Vlster to ioine with him, he did commit a
robberie; and being pursued for the same, he was slaine by a gentleman, and one
of his owne kinsmen Theobald Burke, and his head &amp; quarters set vpon the gates of
the towne of Kilmallocke.</p>
<p>Then Iames of Desmond brother to the earle, hauing done a robberie vpon sir
<note place="marg">Iames Desmond taken in a roberie, hanged, drawne, &amp; quartered.</note>

<note place="marg">Sir Iohn of Desmond slaine, and his bodie hanged by the h&eacute;eles.</note>
Corman mac Teige, was likewise taken and caried to Corke, where he was drawne,
hanged, and quartered; and his head and quarters set vpon the gates and wals of the
citie of Corke. After him, sir Iohn of Desmond, one other brother to the said earle,
who was a speciall champion of the pope, from whom he had receiued manie blessings,
buls, and Agnos dei, which should keepe and preserue him from all harme: yet
for all this his holie cote armour, he was met withall by capteine Zouch and capteine
Dowdall, and by them he receiued his iust reward of a bloudie traitor, and a
fr&eacute;endkiller; being killed and then caried dead to Corke, where his bodie was hanged
by the h&eacute;eles, and his head sent to Dublin, and there set vpon the top of the castle.
And in the end, the earle himselfe was also taken, and with the sword the head was
<note place="marg">The earle of Desmond slaine, and his head sent to London, and set vpon London bridge.</note>
diuided from the bodie: the one was sent to London, and there set vpon London
bridge; and his bodie vncerteine whether it were buried or deuoured by the wild
beasts. And thus a noble race and ancient familie, descended from out of the loines
of princes, is now for treasons and rebellions vtterlie extinguished and ouerthrowne;
onelie one sonne of the said earles is left, and yet prisoner in the Tower of London.
The two doctors, Allen &amp; Sanders, who were the holie fathers legats and nuncios,
<note place="marg">Allen and Sanders died, the one with the sword, the other of famine.</note>
and in their foolish fantasies dreamed that they had the Holie ghost at commandement,
and yet most errant traitors against the lords annointed: the one of them
lifting vp his swoord against hir sacred maiestie, vnder the popes banner at Mounster,
one thousand fiue hundred thr&eacute;escore and ninet&eacute;ene, was slaine and killed:
the other after that he had followed the heeles of the Desmonds almost foure yeares,
wandering to and fro in the woods &amp; bogs, died most miserablie in the wood of
Cleneles, in such diseases as famine and penurie vse to bring. The Romans and
<note place="marg">All strangers slaine.</note>
Spaniards, and the strangers which were sent from the pope and king Philip, with all
their consorts and companies, verie few left of them to returne home, and to carie news
of their successe; but were all put to the sword. And as for the great companies of
souldiors, gallowglasses, kerne, &amp; the common people, who followed this rebellion,
the numbers of them are infinit, whose blouds the earth dranke vp, and whose carcases
the foules of the aire and the rauening beasts of the f&eacute;eld did consume and deuoure.
After this folowed an extreme famine: and such as whom the sword did not
<note place="marg">After the wars folowed a famine.</note>
destroie, the same did consume, and eat out; verie few or none remaining aline,
sauing such as dwelled in cities and townes, and such as were fled ouer into England:
and yet the store in the townes was verie far spent, and they in distresse, albeit
nothing like in comparison to them who liued at large. For they were not onelie
driuen to eat horsses, dogs and dead carions; but also did deuoure the carcases of dead

men, whereof there be sundrie examples: namelie one in the countie of Corke,
where when a malefactor was executed to death, and his bodie left vpon the gallows,
<note place="marg">A man hanged was eaten.</note>
certeine poore people secretlie came, tooke him downe, and did eat him. Likewise
in the baie of Sm&eacute;erew&eacute;eke, or saint Marie w&eacute;eke, the place which was first seasoned
with this rebellion, there happened a ship to be there lost through foule weather, and
<note place="marg">Men drowned and eaten.</note>
all the men being drowned, were there cast on land.</p>
<p>The common people, who had a long time liued on limpets, orewads, and such
shelfish as they could find, and which were now spent; as soone as they saw these
dead bodies, they tooke them vp, and most greedilie did eat and deuoure them:
and not long after, death and famine did eat and consume them. The land it selfe,
which before those wars was populous, well inhabited, and rich in all the good
blessings of God, being plentious of corne, full of cattell, well stored with fish and
sundrie other good commodities, is now become wast and barren, y&eacute;elding no fruits,
the pastures no cattell, the fields no corne, the aire no birds, the seas (though full of
fish) yet to them y&eacute;elding nothing. Finallie, everie waie the cursse of God was so
great, and the land so barren both of man and beast, that whosoeuer did trauell from
the one end vnto the other of all Mounster, euen from Waterford to the head of
Sm&eacute;erew&eacute;eke, which is about six score miles, he should not meet anie man, woman,
or child, sauing in townes and cities; nor yet s&eacute;e anie beast, but the verie woolues,
the foxes, and other like rauening beasts: manie of them laie dead being famished,
and the residue gone elsewhere. A heauie, but a iust iudgement of God vpon
such a Pharoicall and stifnecked people, who by no persuasions, no counsels, and no
reasons, would be reclamed and reduced to serue God in true religion, and to obeie
their most lawfull prince in dutifull obedience; but made choise of a wicked idoll, the
god Mazim to honor, and of that wicked antichrist of Rome to obeie, vnto the vtter
ouerthrow of themselues and of their posteritie. This is the goodnesse that commeth
from that great citie vpon the seuen hils, and that mightie Babylon, the mother
of all wickednesse &amp; abhominations vpon the earth. These be the fruits which come
<note place="marg">The fruits which come from the pope.</note>
from that holie father, maister pope, the sonne of sathan, and the man of sinne, and
the enimie vnto the crosse of Christ, whose bloodthirstinesse will neuer be quenched,
but in the blood of the saints, and the seruants of God; and whose rauening guts be neuer
satisfied, but with the death of such as doo serue the Lord in all godlines, &amp; who will
not be drunke in the cup of his fornications: as it dooth appere by the infinit &amp; most
horrible massacres, and bloodie persecutions, which he dailie exerciseth throughout
all christian lands. Which bicause he can not performe also within the realmes of
<note place="marg">The wicked practises of the pope.</note>
England &amp; Ireland, what practises hath he made by inchantments, sorceries, witchcrafts,
&amp; tresons to beereaue hir maiestie of hir life? What deuises hath he vsed to
raise vp hir owne subiects to rebellions and commotions, to supplant hir of hir roiall
estate and gouernment? What practises hath he vsed with forren princes and potentats,
to s&eacute;eke occasions of breaches of peace and raisings of warres? And how craftilie
hath he suborned his vnholie &amp; traitorous Iesuits, vnder colour of holines, to
range from place to place through hir maiesties realmes, and to mooue and persuade
hir people from dutifull obedience vnto hir highnesse, and to denie hir supreme authoritie
and gouernment? Finallie, how dooth he from time to time like a rauening
woolfe s&eacute;eke the deuouring of hir, and of all hir good subiects, which liue in the
feare of God, and in the religion established vpon his holie word and gospell?
Whereof hath insued the losse of infinit thousands of people, as wherof manie
apparant examples are set downe and recorded in the histories of England; but of
them all, none more lamentable than is this historie of Ireland, and especiallie this

tragedie of Mounster. In which it dooth appeare, how that for the maintenance
of the popes quarels, the earth hath drunke vp the bloud, the fouls of the aire haue
preied, and the beasts of the field haue deuoured the carcases of infinit multitudes
&amp; numbers of people. Which if euerie man would well looke into and consider,
the vngodlie shall s&eacute;e the great iudgements of God, and his seuere iustice against all
such as shall dishonor his holie name; and against such as shall rebell and resist
against his annointed: that thereby they may repent, amend their liues, and be conuerted
vnto the Lord, both in true religion towards him, and in all dutifull obedience
to his annointed. And the good and godlie shall s&eacute;e, and thereby consider
the great good mercies shewed vpon them, in that he hath and continuallie dooth
preserue and k&eacute;epe them from out of the iawes of the lion in all safetie, that they
should dailie more and more grow from grace to grace, and liue in all holinesse and
vertue towards him, and persist in all dutifull obedience vnto hir maiestie our souereigne
ladie and queene; whose daies the Lord God continue and prolong to reigne
ouer vs to his good will and pleasure: and so shall we hir people s&eacute;e good daies, liue
in securitie, and the peace of Israell shall be vpon vs.</p>
