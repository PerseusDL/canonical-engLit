<p><name type="authority">Steevens</name> is, I believe, the earliest among editors to attempt to fix the <emph>Date</emph> of
publication of this play. In the <title>Variorum</title> of <date>1785</date> (p. 131) he calls attention to
the following entry in the <title>Stationers' Registers</title>:
<table>
<row role="data"><cell rows="1" role="data" cols="1"><foreign lang="la"><date>xix die Octobris. [1593]</date></foreign></cell></row>

<p>This Symon Waterson, Steevens goes on to say, was the printer of some of Daniel's
works; the foregoing entry probably refers, therefore, <quote>to Daniel's <title>Cleopatra,</title> of
which there are several editions.</quote> Steevens found a second entry, of which he
remarks that <quote>it is the first notice I have met with concerning any edition of this
play, more ancient than the folio of <date>1623</date>.</quote> It is as follows:

<div2 type="subsection" n="Malone"><head>Malone</head>
<p><name type="authority">Malone</name>, in his edition of <date>1790</date>, says, in his notice of <title>Julius C&aelig;sar</title> (vol. i, p. 369),
that <quote>we have certain proof that <title>Antony and Cleopatra</title> was composed before the middle
of the year <date>1608</date>.</quote> This certain proof is the entry in the <title>Stationers Registers</title> of
that year, but Malone gives a slightly wrong impression in saying that the 20th of May
is <quote>before the middle of the year</quote>; the year then began in March and the middle of
the year fell in September. As a further corroboration of this date, <date>1608</date>, he observes
(p. 372) that <quote>in Ben Jonson's <title>Silent Woman,</title> IV, iv [IV, ii, ed. Gifford], <date>1609</date>, this
play seems to be alluded to: <quote><sp><speaker>Morose.</speaker> <p>Nay, I would sit out a play, that were nothing
but <emph>fights at sea,</emph> drum, trumpet, and target.</p></sp></quote></quote> If the reference be here to <title>Antony &amp;
Cleopatra,</title> the play which is <quote><emph>nothing but</emph> fights at sea</quote> dwindles to a single stage-
direction <quote>Alarum as at a sea fight.</quote>&mdash;IV, xii, 1. The flimsiness of the pretence of
adducing this quotation from Jonson as an indication of the date of <title>Anthony &amp; Cleopatra</title> 
is thus exposed by <name type="authority">Gifford</name>: <quote>Long before <title>The Silent Woman</title> was written,
nay, before Shakespeare was known to the stage, the theatres were in possession of
many rude pieces founded on the remarkable events of our history, of which battles,
etc., always formed a prominent feature. The miserable attempts to represent these
favourite scenes, were often made a subject of mirth by succeeding writers.</quote> Nevertheless,
<pb n="382"/>
<name type="authority">George Chalmers</name>, the next critic who deals with the Chronology of the
Plays, repeats Malone's quotation from <title>The Silent Woman</title> without dissent; he also
accepts the proof to be drawn from the entry in the <title>Stationers' Registers</title> as conclusive,
and observes that if this tragedy were written as a sequel to <title>Julius C&aelig;sar,</title> <quote>it may,
perhaps, have been written in the beginning of the year <date>1608</date>.</quote> He also opines
(<bibl><title>Supplemental Apology,</title> <date>1799</date>, p. 432</bibl>) that &lsquo;like other preceding dramas, this tragedy
had been suggested to the observant mind of Shakespeare, by prior intimations. . . .
The argument of Daniel's <title>Cleopatra</title> may have furnished the more dramatic genius of
Shakespeare with several hints, which he well knew how to work into a better form.
He had seen in <title>The Devils Incarnate,</title> in <date>1596</date>, which he had attentively read,
what Lodge had remarked, how &ldquo;Anthony, dallying in delights with Cleopatra,
gave C&aelig;sar opportunitie of many victories.&rdquo;&rsquo;
</p></div2>
<div2 type="subsection" n="Knight"><head>Knight</head>
<p><name type="authority">Knight</name> is the next editor to discuss the Date. In the <bibl><title>Introduction to Coriolanus</title></bibl>
(p. 148) he remarks: <quote>&lsquo;In <date>1623</date> Blount and Jaggard, the publishers of the folio, enter
<quote>Mr. William Shakspere's Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies, so many of the said
copies as are not formerly entered to other men.</quote> Amongst these is <title>Antony and
Cleopatra.</title> All the plays thus entered in <date>1623</date> were unpublished; and not one of them,
with the exception of <title>Antony and Cleopatra,</title> had been <q direct="unspecified">formerly entered</q> by name.
It is therefore more than probable that the <title>Anthony and Cleopatra</title> entered in <date>1608</date> was
not Shakspere's tragedy; and we therefore reject this entry as any evidence that Shakspere's
<title>Antony and Cleopatra</title> was written as early as <date>1608</date>. Upon the date of this
play depends, according to Malone, the date of <title>Julius C&aelig;sar.</title> We state, unhesitatingly,
that there is no <emph>internal</emph> evidence whatever for the dates of any of the three
Roman plays. We believe that they belong to the same cycle; but we would place
that later in Shakspere's life than is ordinarily done. Malone places them together,
properly enough; but in assuming that they were written in <date>1607</date>, <date>1608</date>, and <date>1610</date>,
his theory makes Shakspere almost absolutely unemployed for the last seven years
of his life. We hold that his last years were devoted to these plays.&rsquo;</quote>&mdash;[Knight's
assertion that <quote>all the plays&rsquo; entered in the First Folio list &lsquo;were unpublished,</quote> is,
possibly, a little rash, and yet it is difficult to disprove it. He is on firmer ground
when he says that it is <quote>more than probable</quote> that the <title>Anthony and Cleopatra</title> of <date>1608</date>
is not Shakespeare's tragedy,&mdash;ground which, I think, has been examined by editors
and critics with hardly sufficient care. It raises another mystery; the ever-recurring
mysteries connected with the Quartos has a tendency to become monotonous. The
Edward Blount who entered the copy of <title>Anthony and Cleopatra</title> in <date>1608</date> is the same
Edward Blount who with William Jaggard entered the copy of the First Folio on
the eighth of November, <date>1623</date>, and the terms of the latter entry expressly exclude
<quote>soe manie</quote> of the <quote>Comedyes, Histories, and Tragedyes</quote> <quote>as are not formerly
entred to other men.</quote> In the list which follows there stands our present <title>Anthonie
and Cleopatra.</title> Why, it may be asked, should Edward Blount include this play in
<date>1623</date>, seeing that he had already received the license to print it in <date>1608</date>? To be
sure, it had not been entered to an <quote>other man,</quote> but it had been entered to himself,
and, if, in <date>1608</date>, <emph>it was Shakespeare's play,</emph> why should he desire to take out a double
license? Why should it be mentioned at all, seeing that, <emph>if the <date>1608</date> entry was the
present play</emph> it was already his property? The list, as it stands in the <title>Stationers'
Registers,</title> of unlicensed plays by Shakespeare which Blount and Jaggard were
licensed to print in <date>1623</date> is as follows:<note place="foot" anchored="yes"> Arber's <title>Transcript,</title> iv, 107.</note>

<p>As Knight says, <quote>not one of these, with the exception of <title>Anthonie and Cleopatra,</title>
had been <q direct="unspecified">formerly entred</q> by name.</quote> And, to repeat what I have just said, if the
<date>1608</date> <title>Anthony and Cleopatra</title> were Shakespeare's, and already the property of Edward
Blount, it is not clear why it should have been entered again. When, therefore,
Knight rejects the date of <date>1608</date> as a proof that Shakespeare wrote the present play in
that year, even-handed justice must acknowledge that there is colour for his rejection,
and, furthermore, all who, confiding on this date, erect their scheme of the chronology
of these plays, do so on a foundation which, in respect to the present play, is
not flawless.

<div2 type="subsection" n="G. C. Verplanck"><head>G. C. Verplanck</head>
<p><name type="authority"><ref targOrder="U" target="verplanck-1847">G. C. Verplanck</ref></name> gives a late date to the three plays <title>Coriolanus</title>, <title>Julius C&aelig;sar</title>,
and the present play, because Shakespeare, in these tragedies, preserves throughout
&lsquo;<quote>an artist-like keeping, which, combined with their dramatic skill, the constant propensity
of the author to moral or political argument or reasoning, and the more
habitual and mature tone of his philosophy, as well as with the evidence of diction
and versification, gives strong attestation that they belong to that later epoch of
Shakespeare's authorship, when (to use Coleridge's discriminating criticism) &ldquo;the
energies of intellect in the cycle of genius become predominant over passion and
creative self-manifestation.&rdquo; This period I should place as beginning after the production
of <title>Lear</title> and <title>Macbeth,</title> in <date>1608</date> or <date>1609</date>, or about the Poet's forty-fifth year.
Besides those reasons for ascribing the Roman dramas to this date, which appeal
only to the reader's taste and feeling, the following considerations seem also of some
weight. <title>Coriolanus</title> and its Plutarchian companions appeared first in print in the
posthumous folio of <date>1623</date>, and they were then entered in the Stationers' Register as
among the plays in that volume <q direct="unspecified">not formerly entered to other men.</q> This was the
case with all Shakespeare's later works, either produced or remodelled after <title>Lear;</title>
for it appears that after <title>Othello</title>, <title>Hamlet,</title> and <title>Lear</title> had placed him far above his contemporaries,
his plays became of too much value to the theatrical company which held
the copies to be suffered to go into the market as mere literary property. Again:
there is no period of Shakespeare's life, except the last seven or eight years, where
we can well find room for the production of these dramas. We well know from
<pb n="384"/>
various sources what were the luxuriant products of his youthful genius until <date>1598</date>.
During the succeeding ten years we find him with his full share of interest and
occupation in the management and pecuniary concerns of his theatre, yet employed
in the enlargement of his <title>Hamlet</title> <quote>to as much again as it was,</quote> the improvement and
revision of some of his comedies, and the composition of <title>As You Like It</title>, <title>Much Ado
About Nothing</title>, <title>Twelfth Night,</title> very probably of several of his English historical
plays, and of <title>Timon,</title> and certainly of <title>Othello</title>, <title>Measure for Measure</title>, <title>Troilus and
Cressida</title>, <title>Lear</title>, and <title>Macbeth.</title> It can scarcely be thought that he had then leisure
to add the Roman tragedies to all these. On the other hand, if there had been no
trace of any additional authorship after <date>1609</date>, we might infer that he had been incapacitated
by disease, or drawn away by some other cause from composition; but as
we know that after that date he revised or greatly enlarged some dramas, and wrote
two or three new ones, we have far more reason to presume that some portion of his
leisure, after he had returned to his native village, during which he wrote the <title>Tempest,</title>
was also employed in the composition of these tragedies, filled like that, his
last poetic comedy, with grave and deep reflections, wide moral speculation, and the
sobered energy of mature but calm power, than to believe that they were poured
forth in the same rapid torrent of invention and passionate thought which, during the
ten preceding years of the Poet's life, had enriched English literature with more of
original dramatic character, and poetic sentiment and expression, than it owes to the
life of any other author.</quote>

This is a valuable date, for the verse is still more checked and cut up (as in his
fourth style) than in <title>Coriolanus</title>. <emph>Put off my helmet to My countryman, a Roman.</emph>
Remarkably so, in the change of person in dialogue; but it is far from having the
same load of ideas, nor stiffness. The mind of the reader would flow on more freely,
than in <title>Coriolanus,</title> if the ear were allowed to do so. It is a far more irregular,
varied, play,&mdash;more, perhaps, than any he has written. There is, however, still much
of the crampness of a lesson out of a book, in the political parts. With this crampness
goes correctness of taste. There are not the faults of carelessness or of
unchecked want of taste, which are common in the earlier plays. Mere conceits,
puns, indelicacy, we do not see much of. There are many double endings in this
play.</quote></cit>

<p><cit><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="gervinus-1862"><name type="authority">G. G. Gervinus</name> (ii, 312, <date>1872</date>. 4te Auflage)</ref>:</bibl><quote><p> It may well be that by the <quote>booke,</quote>
entered by Blount, the present play is meant, and that its date of composition may be
set down as in <dateRange>1607-8</dateRange>. Indications of a common treatment of material, certain
peculiarities of style, possibly even more than these, the poet's frame of mind at the
time, place this play near to <title>Tro. &amp; Cress.,</title> which may also tend to confirm this date.</p>
<p>The late date of the present play is corroborated by the Metrical Tests. From
the careful Table, prepared by Prof. <name type="authority">Ingram</name> (<title>New Sh. Soc. Trans.</title> 1874, p. 450),
of Shakespeare's use of light and weak endings, Prof. Ingram deduces the following
results:
<list type="ordered">
<label>1.</label><item> During the first three-fourths (or thereabouts) of Shakspere's poetic life, he
used the light endings [such as <emph>am, are, art, be, been, can,</emph> etc.] very sparingly, and
the weak endings [such as <emph>and, as, at, by, for, from,</emph> etc.] scarcely at all.</item>
<label>2.</label><item> The last fourth (or thereabouts) is obviously and unmistakeably distinguished
<pb n="385"/>
from the earlier stages by the very great increase of the number of light endings,
and, still more, by the first appearance in any appreciable number, and afterwards
the steady growth, of the weak endings.</item>
<label>3.</label><item> Hence, in any discrimination of periods which is founded on metrical considerations,
this last may be called the <q direct="unspecified">weak-ending Period.</q> . . .</item>
<label>7.</label><item> The weak endings do not come in by slow degrees, but the poet seems to
have thrown himself at once into this new structure of verse; 28 examples occurring
in <title>Ant. and Cleop.,</title> whilst there are not more than two in any earlier play.</item>
</list></p>
<p>Accordingly, in Prof. Ingram's Table, <title>Ant. &amp; Cleop.</title> is the twenty-sixth in order,
and is followed only by <quote>&lsquo;<title>Coriolanus</title>, <title>Pericles</title> (Shakspere's part), <title>Tempest</title>, <title>Cymbeline</title>,
<title>Winter's Tale</title>, <title>Henry VIII</title> (Shakspere's part).&rsquo;</quote></p></quote></cit>

<p><cit><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="halliwell-1868"><name type="authority">J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps</name> (<title>Outlines,</title> 5th ed. p. 187)</ref>:</bibl><quote><p> About the time that
<title>Pericles</title> was so well received at the Globe, the tragedy of <title>Antony and Cleopatra</title> was
in course of performance at the same theatre, but, although successful, it did not
equal the former in popularity. It was, however, sufficiently attractive for Blount to
secure the consent of the Master of the Revels to its publication and also for the
company to frustrate his immediate design.&mdash;[In his <title>Illustrative Notes,</title> Halliwell
attempts to substantiate the foregoing positive assertions by adducing two inferences.
On the words <quote>although successful</quote> there is the following note (p. 524): <quote>This
fact may be inferred from the entry in the Stationers&rsquo; Registers of <date>1608</date>, to Edward
Blount of &ldquo;his copie by the lyke aucthoritie, a booke called Anthony and Cleopatra.&rdquo; 
The &ldquo;like authority&rdquo; refers to the sanction of Sir George Buck and the
company, as appears from the previous entry in the register, so that Blount was no
doubt in possession of the copyright of the authentic play. If he printed it in <date>1608</date>,
no copy of the impression is now known to exist, the earliest edition which has been
preserved being that in the collective work of <date>1623</date>, of which Blount was one of
the publishers; and although it is included in the list of tragedies &ldquo;as are not
&ldquo;formerly entred to other men&rdquo; in the notice of the copyright of the folio, it is
still not impossible that an earlier separate edition was issued by him. There are
indications that the list of non-entered plays was carelessly drawn up.</quote> It is
impossible to deny Halliwell's assertion that there are indications that this list is
carelessly drawn up; but he does not state what the indications are; this at least is
certain that it is so far careful that with but two exceptions, not a single play is given
in it which has been before even referred to in the <title>Stationers' Registers;</title> in regard to
the other plays which it specifies the list is strictly accurate. The two exceptions are
<title>As You Like It,</title> which is not entered, but mentioned only <quote>&lsquo;to be staied&rsquo;</quote> and the present
play of <title>Anthony and Cleopatra,</title> if the entry of 20th of May, <date>1608</date> really refers to
it. When, then, we find this list so accurate in regard to all the other plays, I do
not believe we are justified in asserting that it is inaccurate in this one solitary instance,
unless we are positively certain that the entry of 20th of May, <date>1608</date> refers to Shakespeare's
<title>Anthony and Cleopatra.</title> Knight and Verplanck believe that it does not.
And it is impossible to contradict them. There is no proof whatever that it is Shakespeare's
play. We do not even know that it was a play at all,&mdash;it may have been a
prose history. There is nothing here but inferences, as is, unfortunately, so much of
what Halliwell asserts in his <title>Outlines.</title> For instance, in the note (p. 525) on his statement
that <title>Anthony and Cleopatra</title> did not equal <title>Pericles</title> in popularity: <quote>&lsquo;this,&rsquo;</quote> he
remarks, <quote>may be gathered from the rarity of contemporary allusions to it. The only
extrinsic notice of the tragedy during the author's life-time appears to be a curious one
<pb n="386"/>
in Anton's Philosophers Satyrs, <date>1616</date>, where the latter poet blames ladies for encouraging
the performance of so vicious a drama by their presence.</quote> Here, in this note,
there are two inferences which are supposed to substantiate the truth of an assertion.
In its first line, the inference is open and confessed where it is said that <emph>it may be
gathered.</emph> The second inference lies in assuming that Anton, when he speaks of
<quote>&lsquo;Orestes incest, Cleopatres crimes&rsquo;</quote> refers to Shakespeare's play of <title>Anthony and
Cleopatra.</title> That he does so, is purely a surmise on Halliwell's part. If surmises
be once allowed, why may we not surmise that the unknown date of Beaumont and
Fletcher's <title>The False One,</title> wherein Cleopatra is the heroine, be before <date>1616</date>? Weber
places it before <date>1618</date>. Only a little stretching will bring it into <date>1616</date>, and then to it,
and not to Shakespeare, Anton's reference may apply. Moreover, Shakespeare died
in <date>1616</date>. Can a work, which, like Anton's <title>Satyrs</title> is dated <date>1616</date>, be stated without
qualification to contain a <quote>&lsquo;notice of the tragedy during the poet's lifetime&rsquo;</quote>?</p></quote></cit>

<p>It is hardly likely that Shakespeare, in his Historical Dramas, paid much attention
to the passage of time, either historical or dramatic. It was enough that in the flight
of ten years a general sequence of events was preserved. In these circumstances,
where there inevitably exists much shuffling of times, it is a task of extreme difficulty
to unravel the tangled skein and to determine the division into days of dramatic time.

<p>After the painful student has waded through the preceding pages of this volume, it
seems impertinently superfluous to state that Shakespeare drew the Source of his Plot
from North's <title>Translation of Plutarch.</title> The continual references in the <title>Commentary</title>
to this portion of the <title>Appendix</title> are wearisome in their iteration. Yet, surely, that
mind must be inert, indeed, that finds no pleasure in observing the magic whereby
Shakespeare, gilding the pale stream with heavenly alchemy, transfigures the quiet
prose, at times almost word for word, into exalted poetry. In the following pages
only those passages are reprinted from the <title>Life of Antonius</title> which, in the Editor's
judgement, have any relation to the present play. In the original there are marginal
notes, in Italics, setting forth the substance of the adjoining text; in order to save
space these have been omitted, and their places supplied by references, in broad-
faced type, to Acts, Scenes, and Lines in the play.</p>
<p>The following <title>Transcript</title> is taken from the <title>Photolithograph</title> of <ref targOrder="U" target="leo-1878"><title>Four Chapters of
North's Plutarch,</title></ref> of the edition of 1595, published in 1878, by Dr <placeName>F. A. Leo</placeName>, of
Berlin.

<p>Thereupon he left <placeName>Italy</placeName>, &amp; went into <placeName>Grece</placeName>, &amp; there bestowed the most part
of his time, sometime in warres, and otherwhile in the studie of
eloquence. He vsed a manner of phrase in his speech, called
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, iii, 67.</note>
Asiatike, which caried the best grace and estimation at that time, and was
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, xii, 51.</note>
much like to his manners and life: for it was full of ostentation, foolish
 brauerie, and vaine ambition. . . .</p>
<p>But besides all this, he had a noble presence, and shewed a countenance of one
of a noble house: he had a goodly thicke beard, a broad forehead, crooke nosed,
and there appeared such a manly looke in his countenance, as is commonly seene in
<name>Hercules</name> pictures, stamped or grauen in mettall. Now it had bene a speech of old
time, that the familie of the <name>Anton&yuml;</name> were discended from one <name>Anton,</name>
the sonne of <name>Hercules,</name> whereof the family tooke name. This opinion
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, iii, 105.</note>
did <name>Antonius</name> seeke to confirme in all his doings: not onely resembling
 him in the likenesse of his bodie, as we haue saide before, but
also in the wearing of his garments. For when he would openly shewe himselfe
abroad before many people, he would alwaies weare his cassocke girt downe low
vppon his hippes, with a great sword hanging by his side, and vpon that, some ill
fauoured cloke. Furthermore, things that seeme intollerable in other
men, as to boast commonly, to ieast with one or other, to drinke like
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, iv, 22, etc.</note>
a good fellow with euery bodie, to sit with the souldiers when they
dine, and to eate and drinke with them souldierlike: it is incredible
what wonderfull loue it wanne him amongst them. And furthermore, being given
to loue: that made him the more desired, and by that meanes he brought many to
loue him. For he would further euery mans loue, and also would not be angry that
men should merily tell him of those he loued. But besides all this, that which most
procured his rising and aduancement, was his liberalitie, who gaue all to the souldiers,
and kept nothing for himselfe: and when he was growen to great credite, then was
his authoritie and power also very great, the which notwithstanding himselfe did
ouerthrowe, by a thousand other faults he had. . . .</p>
<p>Then was <name>Antonius</name> straight maruellously commended and beloued
of the souldiers, because he commonly exercised himselfe among
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, iv, 22.</note>
them, and would oftentimes eate and drinke with them, and also be
liberall vnto them, according to his abilitie. . . .</p>
<p>Afterwardes when <name>Pompeys</name> house was put to open sale, <name>Antonius</name>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, vii, 151,</note>
bought it: but when they asked him money for it, he made it very
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">see post.</note>
strange, and was offended with them. . . .</p>
<p>And therefore he left his dissolute manner of life, and maried
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, ii, 137</note>
<name>Fuluia</name> that was <name>Clodius</name> widdow, a woman not so basely minded to
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, ii, 76.</note>
spend her time in spinning and housewiuery, and was not contented
to master her husband at home, but would also rule him in his office abroade, and
<pb n="389"/>
commaund him, that commaunded legions and great armies: so that <name>Cleopatra</name> was
to giue <name>Fuluia</name> thankes for that shee had taught <name>Antonius</name> this obedience to women,
that learned so well to be at their commandement. . . .</p>
<p>Now things remayning in this state at <placeName>Rome</placeName>, <name>Octauius C&aelig;sar</name>
the yonger came to <placeName>Rome</placeName>, who was the sonne of <name>Julius C&aelig;sars</name>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vi, 7.</note>
Neece, as you haue heard before, and was left his lawfull heire by
will, remayning at the time of the death of his great Vncle that was
slaine, in the City of <placeName>Apollonia</placeName>. . . .</p>
<p><name>Cicero</name> on the other side being at that time the chiefest man of authority and estimation
 in the city, he stirred vp all men against <name>Antonius:</name> so that in the end he made
the Senate pronounce him an enemy to his country, and appointed yong <name>C&aelig;sar</name> Sergeants
 to cary axes before him, and such other signes as were incident
 to the dignity of a Consull or Pr&aelig;tor: and moreouer sent 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, iv, 67.</note>
<name>Hircius</name> and <name>Pansa,</name> then Consuls, to driue <name>Antonius</name> out of <placeName>Italy</placeName>.
These two Consuls together with <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> who also had an army,
went against <name>Antonius</name> that besieged the city of <placeName>Modena</placeName>, and there ouerthrew him in
battel: but both the Consuls were slaine there. <name>Antonius</name> flying vpon this ouerthrow,
fell into great misery all at once: but the chiefest want of all other, and that pinched
him most, was famine. Howbeit he was of such a strong nature, that by patience he
would ouercome any aduersitie, and the heauier fortune lay vpon him, the more constant
 shewed he himselfe. Euery man that feeleth want or aduersity, knoweth by
vertue and discretion what he should doe: but when indeede they are ouerlayed with
extremity, and be sore oppressed, few haue the hearts to follow that which they praise
and commend, and much lesse to auoide that they reproue and mislike. But rather
to the contrary, they yeeld to their accustomed easie life: and through faint heart, &amp;
lacke of corage, doe chaunge their first mind and purpose. And therefore it was a
wonderfull example to the souldiers, to see <name>Antonius</name> that was brought
vp in all finenesse and superfluity, so easily to drinke puddle water,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, iv, 70.</note>
and to eate wild frutes and rootes: and moreouer it is reported, that
euen as they passed the Alpes, they did eate the barkes of trees, and
such beasts, as neuer man tasted of their flesh before. . . .</p>
<p>Thus <name>Antonius</name> being a foote againe, and growen of great power, repassed ouer
the Alpes, leading into <placeName>Italy</placeName> with him seuenteene legions, and tenne thousand horsemen,
 besides sixe legions he left in garrison among the <placeName>Gavles</placeName>, vnder the charge of
one <name>Varius,</name> a companion of his that woulde drinke lustely with him, and therefore
in mockery was surnamed <name>Cotylon:</name> to wit, a bibber.</p>
<p>But setting aside the ill name he had for his insolency, he was yet much more
hated in respect of the house he dwelt in, the which was the house of <name>Pompey</name> the
great: a man as famous for his temperance, modesty, and ciuil life,
as for his three triumphes. For it grieued them to see the gates
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, vii, 151.</note>
commonly shut against the Captaines, Magistrates of the city, and
also Ambassadors of straunge nations, which were sometimes thrust
from the gate with violence. . . .</p>
<p>When they had passed ouer the seas, and that they beganne to make warre, they
being both camped by their enemies, to wit, <name>Antonius</name> against <name>Cassius,</name> and <name>C&aelig;sar</name>
against <name>Brutus</name>: <name>C&aelig;sar</name> did no great matter, but <name>Antonius</name> had alway the vpper hand,
and did all. For at the first battell <name>C&aelig;sar</name> was ouerthrowen by <name>Brutus,</name> and lost his
campe, and very hardly saued him selfe by flying from them that followed him.
Howbeit he writeth himselfe in his Commentaries, that he fled before the charge was
<pb n="390"/>
giuen, because of a dreame one of his friends had. <name>Antonius</name> on the other side ouerthrew
 <name>Cassius</name> in battell, though some write that he was not there himselfe at the battel,
 but that he came after the ouerthrow, whilest his men had the enemies in chase.
So <name>Cassius</name> at his earnest request was slaine by a faithfull seruant of his own called
<name>Pindarus,</name> whom he had infranchised: because he knew not in time that <name>Brutus</name>
had ouercome <name>C&aelig;sar.</name> Shortly after they fought an other battell
againe, in the which <name>Brutus</name> was ouerthrowen, who afterwardes also
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, xi, 41.</note>
slue himself. Thus <name>Antonius</name> had the chiefest glory of all this victory,
 specially because <name>C&aelig;sar</name> was sicke at that time. . . .</p>
<p><name>Antonius</name> being thus inclined, the last and extreamest mischiefe of all other (to
wit, the loue of <name>Cleopatra</name>) lighted on him, who did waken and stirre vp many vices
yet hidden in him, and were neuer seene to any: and if any sparke of goodnesse or
hope of rising were left him, <name>Cleopatra</name> quenched it straight, and made it worse then
before. The manner how he fell in loue with her was this. <name>Antonius</name> going to make
warre with the <placeName>Parthians</placeName>, sent to command <name>Cleopatra</name> to appeare personally before
him, when he came into <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>, to aunswere vnto such accusations as were laide
against her, being this: that she had aided <name>Cassius</name> and <name>Brutus</name> in their warre against
him. The messenger sent vnto <name>Cleopatra</name> to make his summons vnto her, was called
<name>Dellius:</name> who when he had thoroughly considered her beautie, the excellent grace
and sweetenesse of her tongue, he nothing mistrusted that <name>Antonius</name> would doe any
hurt to so noble a Ladie, but rather assured himselfe, that within few dayes she should
be in great fauor with him. Thereupon he did her great honour, and perswaded
her to come into <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>, as honourably furnished as she could possible, and bad her
not to be affraide at all of <name>Antonius,</name> for he was a more courteous Lord, then any that
she had euer seene. <name>Cleopatra</name> on the other side beleeuing <name>Dellius</name> words, &amp; gessing
by the former accesse and credit she had with <name>Julius C&aelig;sar,</name> and <name>Cneus Pompey</name> (the
sonne of <name>Pompey</name> the great) onely for her beautie: she began to haue good hope that
she might more easily win <name>Antonius.</name> For <name>C&aelig;sar</name> and <name>Pompey</name> knew her when she
was but a young thing, &amp; knew not then what the worlde ment: but
now she went to <name>Antonius</name> at the age when a womans beautie is at
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, v, 86.</note>
the prime, and she also of best iudgement. So, she furnished herselfe
 with a world of gifts, store of gold and siluer, and of riches and
other sumptuous ornaments, as is credible enough she might bring from so great a
house, and from so wealthie and rich a realme as <placeName>&AElig;gypt</placeName> was. But yet she caried
nothing with her wherein she trusted more then in her selfe, and in the charmes and
inchauntment of her passing beautie and grace. Therefore when she was sent vnto
by diuers letters, both from <name>Antonius</name> himselfe, and also from his friendes, she made
so light of it and mocked <name>Antonius</name> so much, that she disdained to set
forward otherwise, but to take her barge in the riuer of Cydnus, the
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, ii, 225.</note>
poope whereof was of gold, the sailes of purple, and the owers of
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, ii, 243.</note>
siluer, which kept stroke in rowing after the sound of the musicke
of flutes, howboyes, cytherns, vyolls, and such other instruments as they played vpon
in the barge. And now for the person of her selfe: she was laide vnder a pauillion
of cloth of golde of tissue, apparelled and attired like the goddesse <name>Venus,</name> commonly
drawen in picture: and hard by her, on either hand of her, pretie faire boyes apparelled
 as painters doe set foorth god <name>Cupide,</name> with litle fans in their hands, with the
which they fanned winde vpon her. Her Ladies and gentlewomen also, the fairest
of them were apparelled like the nymphes <name>Nereides</name> (which are the myrmaides of the
waters) and like the <name>Graces,</name> some stearing the helme, others tending the tackle and
<pb n="391"/>
ropes of the barge, out of the which there came a wonderfull passing sweete sauor
of perfumes, that perfumed the wharfes side, pestered with innumerable multitudes
of people. Some of them followed the barge all alongst the riuers side: others also
ranne out of the citie to see her comming in. So that in the end, there ranne such
multitudes of people one after an other to see her, that <name>Antonius</name> was left post alone
in the market place, in his Imperiall seate to giue audience: and there went a rumor
in the peoples mouthes, that the goddesse <name>Venus</name> was come to play with the god <name>Bacchus,</name>
 for the generall good of all <placeName>Asia.</placeName> When <name>Cleopatra</name> landed, <name>Antonius</name> sent to
inuite her to supper to him. But she sent him worde againe, he should doe better
rather to come and suppe with her. <name>Antonius</name> therefore to shew himselfe curteous
vnto her at her arriuall, was contented to obey her, and went to supper to her: where
he found such passing sumptuous fare, that no tongue can expresse it. But amongst
all other things, he most wondered at the infinite number of lightes and torches
hanged on the toppe of the house, giuing light in euery place, so artificially set and
ordered by deuises, some round, some square: that it was the rarest thing to behold
that eye could discerne, or that euer bookes could mention. The next night, <name>Antonius</name>
feasting her, contended to passe her in magnificence and finenes: but she ouercame
him in both. So that he himselfe began to scorne the grosse seruice of his house, in
respect of <name>Cleopatraes</name> sumptuousnes and finenesse. And when <name>Cleopatra</name> found
<name>Antonius</name> ieasts and flents to be but grosse, and souldier like, in plaine manner: she
gaue it him finely, and without feare taunted him throughly. Now her beautie (as
it is reported) was not so passing, as vnmatchable of other women, nor yet such, as
vpon present viewe did enamor men with her: but so sweete was her companie and
conuersation, that a man could not possiblie but be taken. And besides her beautie,
the good grace she had to talke and discourse, her curteous nature that tempered her
words &amp; deedes, was a spurre that pricked to the quick. Furthermore, besides all
these, her voice and words were maruellous pleasant: for her tongue was an instrument
 of musicke to diuers sportes and pastimes, the which she easily turned to any
language that pleased her. She spake vnto few barbarous people by interpreter, but
made them answere her selfe, or at the least the most part of them: as the <placeName>&AElig;thiopians</placeName>,
 the <placeName>Arabians</placeName>, the <placeName>Troglodytes</placeName>, the <placeName>Hebrves</placeName>, the <placeName>Syrians</placeName>, the <placeName>Medes</placeName>,
and the <placeName>Parthians</placeName>, and to many others also, whose languages she had learned.
Whereas diuers of her progenitors, the kings of <placeName>&AElig;gypt</placeName>, could scarce learne the
<placeName>&AElig;gyptian</placeName> tongue only &amp; many of them forgot to speake the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName>. Now,
<name>Antonius</name> was so rauished with the loue of <name>Cleopatra,</name> that though his wife <name>Fuluia</name>
had great warres, and much a doe with <name>C&aelig;sar</name> for his affaires, and that the armie of
the <placeName>Parthians</placeName> (the which the kings Lieutenantes had giuen to the only leading of
<name>Labienus</name>) was now assembled in <placeName>Mesopotamia</placeName> readie to inuade <placeName>Syria</placeName>: yet, as
though all this had nothing touched him, he yeelded himselfe to goe with <name>Cleopatra</name>
into <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, where he spent and lost in childish sports (as a man might say)
and idle pastimes, the most pretious thing a man can spend, as <name>Antiphon</name> saith: and
that is, time. For they made an order betwene them, which they called Amimetobion
(as much to say, no life comparable and matchable with it) one feasting each other
by turnes, and in cost, exceeding all measure and reason. And for proofe hereof, I
haue heard my grandfather <name>Lampryas</name> report, that one <name>Philotas</name> a Phisitian, borne in
the city of <placeName>Amphissa</placeName>, told him that he was at that present time in <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>,
and studied Phisicke: and that hauing acquaintance with one of <name>Antonius</name> cookes,
he tooke him with him to <name>Antonius</name> house, (being a young man desirous to see
things) to shew him the wonderfull sumptuous charge and preparation of one only
<pb n="392"/>
supper. When he was in the kitchin, and saw a world of diuersities of meates, and
amongst others, eight wild boares rosted whole: he began to wonder
at it, and saide, sure you haue a great number of guestes to supper.
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, ii, 213.</note>
The cooke fell a laughing, and answered him, no (quoth he) not many
guestes, nor aboue twelue in all: but yet all that is boyled or roasted
must be serued in whole, or else it would be marred straight. For <name>Antonius</name> peraduenture
 will suppe presently, or it may be a pretie while hence, or likely enough he
will deferre it longer, for that he hath drunke well to day, or else hath had some
other great matters in hand: and therefore we doe not dresse one supper onely, but
many suppers, because we are uncertaine of the houre he will suppe in. <name>Philotas</name> the
Phisitian tolde my grandfather this tale. . . .</p>
<p>But now againe to <name>Cleopatra. Plato</name> writeth that there are foure kinds of flatterie:
but <name>Cleopatra</name> deuided it into many kinds. For she, were it in sport, or in matters of
earnest, still deuised sundrie newe delights to haue <name>Antonius</name> at commaundement,
neuer leauing him night nor day, nor once letting him go out of her sight. For
she would play at dice with him, drinke with him, &amp; hunt commonly with him,
and also be with him when he went to any exercise or actiuitie of
body. And sometime also, when he would go vp and downe the
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, i, 68.</note>
citie disguised as a slaue in the night, &amp; would peere into poore
mens windowes &amp; their shops, and scold and braule with them
within the house: <name>Cleopatra</name> would be also in a chamber maides array, and amble
vp and downe the streetes with him, so that oftentimes <name>Antonius</name> bare away both
mockes and blowes. Now, though most men misliked this manner, yet the <placeName>Alexandrians</placeName>
 were commonly glad of this iolity, and liked it well, saying very gallantly,
and wisely: that <name>Antonius</name> shewed them a comicall face, to wit, a merie countenance:
and the <placeName>Romaines</placeName> a tragicall face, to say, a grimme looke. But to reckon vp all
the foolish sportes they made, reuelling in this sort: it were too fonde a part of me,
and therefore I will only tell you one among the rest. On a time he went to angle
for fish, and when he could take none, he was as angrie as could be, because
<name>Cleopatra</name> stood by. Wherefore he secretly commaunded the fisher men, that when
he cast in his line, they should straight diue vnder the water, and put a fish on his
hooke which they had taken before: and so snatched vp his angling rodde, and
brought vp fish twise or thrise. <name>Cleopatra</name> found it straight, yet she seemed not to
see it, but wondred at his excellent fishing: but when she was alone by her selfe
among her owne people, she tolde them how it was, and bad them the next morning
to be on the water to see the fishing. A number of people came to the hauen, and
got into the fisher boates to see this fishing. <name>Antonius</name> then threw in his line and
<name>Cleopatra</name> straight commanded one of her men to diue vnder water
before <name>Antonius</name> men, and to put some old salt fish vpon his baite,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, v, 21.</note>
like vnto those that are brought out of the country of <placeName>Pont</placeName>. When
he had hong the fish on his hook, <name>Antonius</name> thinking he had taken
a fish in deede, snatched vp his line presently. Then they all fell a laughing.
<name>Cleopatra</name> laughing also, said vnto him: leaue vs (my Lord) <placeName>&AElig;gyptians</placeName> (which
dwell in the country of <placeName>Pharvs &amp; Canobus</placeName>) your angling rod: this is not thy profession:
 thou must hunt after conquering of realmes and countries.
Now <name>Antonius</name> delighting in these fond and childish pastimes, very
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, ii, 102.</note>
ill newes were brought him from two places. The first from <placeName>Rome</placeName>,
that his brother <name>Lucius</name> and <name>Fuluia</name> his wife, fell out first betwene
themselues, and afterwards fell to open warre with <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> &amp; had brought all to
<pb n="393"/>
nought, that they were both driuen to flie out of <placeName>Italy</placeName>. The second newes, as
bad as the first: that <name>Labienus</name> conquered all <placeName>Asia</placeName> with the armie of the <placeName>Parthians</placeName>,
 from the riuer of Euphrates, and from <placeName>Syria</placeName>, vnto the
countries of <placeName>Lydia</placeName> and <placeName>Ionia.</placeName> Then beganne <name>Antonius</name> with
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, ii, 113.</note>
much a do, a litle to rouse him selfe as if he had bene wakened
out of a deepe sleepe, and as a man may say, comming out of a
great drunkennesse. So, first of all he bent himselfe against the <placeName>Parthians</placeName>, and
went as farre as the country of <placeName>Ph&oelig;nicia</placeName>: but there he receiued lamentable letters
from his wife <name>Fuluia.</name> Whereupon he straight returned towardes <placeName>Italy</placeName>, with two
hundred saile: and as he went, took vp his friends by the way that fled out of
<placeName>Italie</placeName>, to come to him. By them he was informed, that his wife <name>Fuluia</name> was the
only cause of this warre: who being of a peeuish, crooked, and troublesome nature,
had purposely raised this vprore in <placeName>Italy</placeName>, in hope thereby to withdraw
 him from <name>Cleopatra.</name> But by good fortune, his wife <name>Fuluia</name>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, ii, 139.</note>
going to meete with <name>Antonius</name> sickned by the way, and died in the
citie of <placeName>Sicyone</placeName>: and therefore <name>Octavius C&aelig;sar,</name> and he were the
easilier made friends together. For when <name>Antonius</name> landed in <placeName>Italie</placeName>, and that men
saw <name>C&aelig;sar</name> asked nothing of him, and that <name>Antonius</name> on the other side laide all the
fault &amp; burden on his wife <name>Fuluia:</name> the friendes of both parties would not suffer them
to vnrippe any old matters, and to proue or defend who had the wrong or right, and
who was the first procurer of this warre, fearing to make matters worse betwene them:
but they made them friendes together, and deuided the Empire of <placeName>Rome</placeName> betwene
them, making the sea Ionium the bounds of their diuision. For they gaue all the
prouinces Eastward vnto <name>Antonius:</name> and the countries Westward, vnto <name>C&aelig;sar:</name> and
left <placeName>Africke</placeName> vnto <name>Lepidus:</name> and made a law, that they three one after an other
should make their friends Consuls, when they would not be themselues. This
seemed to be a good councell, but yet it was to be confirmed with a straighter bond,
which fortune offered thus. There was <name>Octauia</name> the eldest sister of
C&aelig;sar, not by one mother, for she came of <name>Ancharia,</name> &amp; <name>C&aelig;sar</name> himselfe
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, ii, 139.</note>
afterwards of <name>Accia.</name> It is reported, that he dearly loued his
sister <name>Octauia,</name> for in deede she was a noble Ladie, and left the
widow of her first husband <name>Caius Marcellus,</name> who died not long before: and it
seemed also that <name>Antonius</name> had bene widower euer since the death of his wife <name>Fuluia.</name>
For he denied not that he kept <name>Cleopatra,</name> but so did he not confesse that he had her
as his wife: &amp; so with reason he did defend the loue he bare vnto this <placeName>&AElig;gpytian</placeName>
<name>Cleopatra.</name> Thereupon euery man did set forward this mariage, hoping thereby that
this Ladie <name>Octauia,</name> hauing an excellent grace, wisedom, &amp; honestie, ioyned vnto so
rare a beautie, that when she were with <name>Antonius</name> (he louing her as so worthy a Ladie
deserueth) she should be a good meane to keepe good loue &amp; amitie betwixt her
brother and him. So when <name>C&aelig;sar</name> &amp; he had made the match betwene them, they
both went to <placeName>Rome</placeName> about this mariage, although it was against the law, that a widow
should be maried within tenne monthes after her husbandes death. Howbeit the
Senate dispensed with the law, and so the mariage proceeded accordingly. <name>Sextus
Pompeius</name> at that time kept in <placeName>Sicilia</placeName>, and so made many an inrode
into <placeName>Italie</placeName> with a great number of pynnasies and other pirates
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">I, iv, 56.</note>
shippes, of the which were Captaines two notable pirats, <name>Menas</name> and
<name>Menecrates,</name> who so scoured all the sea thereabouts, that none durst
peepe out with a saile. Furthermore, <name>Sextus Pompeius</name> had dealt very friendly with
<name>Antonius,</name> for he had courteously receiued his mother, when she fled out of <placeName>Italie</placeName>
<pb n="394"/>
with <name>Fuluia:</name> and therefore they thought good to make peace with him. So they
met all three together by the mount of Misena, vpon a hill that runneth farre into the
sea: <name>Pompey</name> hauing his shyppes ryding hard by at anker, and <name>Antonius</name> and <name>C&aelig;sar</name> their
armies vpon the shore side, directly ouer against him. Now, after they had agreed
that <name>Sextus Pompeius</name> should haue <placeName>Sicile</placeName> and <placeName>Sardinia</placeName>, with this condition, that he
should ridde the sea of all theeues and pirats, and make it safe for passengers, and
withall that he should send a certaine of wheate to <placeName>Rome</placeName>: one of
them did feast an other, and drew cuts who should beginne. It was
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, vi, 102.</note>
<name>Pompeius</name> chaunce to inuite them first. Whereupon <name>Antonius</name> asked
him: and where shall we sup? There, said <name>Pompey,</name> and shewed
him his admirall galley which had sixe banks of owers: that (said he) is my fathers
house they haue left me. He spake it to taunt <name>Antonius,</name> because
he had his fathers house, that was <name>Pompey</name> the great. So he cast
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, vi, 34.</note>
anckers enow into the sea, to make his galley fast, and then built a
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, vii, 151.</note>
bridge of wood to conuey them to his galley, from the head of mount
Misena: and there he welcomed them, and made them great cheere. Now in the
middest of the feast, when they fell to be merie with <name>Antonius</name> loue vnto <name>Cleopatra:
Menas</name> the pirate came to <name>Pompey,</name> &amp; whispering in his eare, said
vnto him: shall I cut the gables of the ankers, and make thee Lord
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, vii, 84.</note>
not only of <placeName>Sicile</placeName> and <placeName>Sardinia</placeName>, but of the whole Empire of
<placeName>Rome</placeName> besides? <name>Pompey</name> hauing paused a while vpon it, at length
answered him: thou shouldest haue done it, and neuer haue told it me, but now we
must content vs with that we haue. As for my selfe, I was neuer taught to breake
my faith, nor to be counted a traitor. The other two also did likewise
 feast him in their campe, and then he returned into <placeName>Sicile</placeName>.
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, vii, 149.</note>
<name>Antonius</name> after this agreement made, sent <name>Ventidius</name> before into <placeName>Asia</placeName>
to stay the <placeName>Parthians</placeName>, and to keepe them they should come no
further: and he himselfe in the meane time, to gratifie <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> was contented to be
chosen <name>Iulius C&aelig;sars</name> priest and sacrificer, &amp; so they ioyntly together dispatched all
great matters, concerning the state of the Empire. But in all other maner of sports
and exercises, wherein they passed the time away the one with the other:
Antonius was euer inferior vnto <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> &amp; alway lost, which grieued him much.
With <name>Antonius</name> there was a soothsayer or astronomer of <placeName>&AElig;gypt</placeName>, that could cast a
figure, and iudge of mens natiuities, to tell them what should happen to them. He,
either to please <name>Cleopatra,</name> or else for that he found it so by his art, tolde <name>Antonius</name>
plainely, that his fortune (which of it selfe was excellent good, and very great) was
altogether bleamished and obscured by <name>C&aelig;sars</name> fortune: and therefore
 he counselled him vtterly to leaue his company, and to get him
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, iii, 22.</note>
as farre from him as he could. For thy <name>Demon,</name> said he, (that is to
say, the good angell and spirit that keepeth thee) is affraide of his:
and being coragious &amp; high when he is alone, becometh fearfull and timerous when
he commeth neere vnto the other. Howsoeuer it was, the euents ensuing proued the
<placeName>&AElig;gyptians</placeName> words true. For, it is said, that as often as they two drew cuts for pastime,
 who should haue anything, or whether they plaied at dice, <name>Antonius</name> alway lost.
Oftentimes when they were disposed to see cockfight, or quailes that
were taught to fight one with an other: <name>C&aelig;sars</name> cockes or quailes did
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">II, iii, 43.</note>
euer ouercome. The which spighted <name>Antonius</name> in his mind, although
he made no outward shew of it: and therefore he beleeued the <placeName>&AElig;gyptian</placeName>
 the better. In fine, he recommended the affaires of his house vnto <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> &amp; went
<pb n="395"/>
out of <placeName>Italy</placeName> with <name>Octauia</name> his wife, whom he caried into <placeName>Grece</placeName>, after he had had a
daughter by her. So <name>Antonius</name> lying al the winter at <placeName>Athens</placeName>, news came vnto him
of the victories of <name>Ventidius,</name> who had ouercome the <placeName>Parthians</placeName> in battell, in the
which also were slaine, <name>Labienus</name> and <name>Pharnabates,</name> the chiefest Captaine king <name>Orodes</name>
had. For these good newes he feasted all <placeName>Athens</placeName>, and kept open house for all the
<placeName>Grecians</placeName>, and many games of price were plaid at <placeName>Athens</placeName>, of the which he himselfe
would be iudge. Wherefore leauing his gard, his axes, and tokens of his Empire at
his house, he came into the shew place (or listes) where these games were plaide in
a long gowne and slippers after the <placeName>Grecian</placeName> fashion, and they caried tippestaues
before him, as martials men do carie before the Iudges to make place: and he himselfe
 in person was a stickler to part the young men, when they had fought enough.
After that, preparing to go to the warres, he made him a garland of the holy Oliue,
and caried a vessell with him of the water of the $ountaine Clepsydra, because of an
Oracle he had receiued that so commaunded him. In the meane
time, <name>Ventidius</name> once againe ouercame <name>Pacorus,</name> (<name>Orodes</name> sonne king
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, i, 1.</note>
of <placeName>Parthia</placeName>) in a battel fought in the country of <placeName>Cyrrestica</placeName>, he
being come againe with a great armie to inuade <placeName>Syria</placeName>: at which
battell was slaine a great number of the <placeName>Parthians</placeName>, &amp; among them <name>Pacorus,</name> the
kings owne sonne slaine. This noble exploit as famous as euer any was, was a full
reuenge to the <placeName>Romaines</placeName>, of the shame and losse they had receiued before by the
death of <name>Marcus Crassus:</name> and he made the <placeName>Parthians</placeName> flie, and glad to keepe themselues
 within the confines and territories of <placeName>Mesopotamia, &amp; Media</placeName>,
after they had thrise together bene ouercome in seueral battels. Howbeit
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, i, 16.</note>
<name>Ventidius</name> durst not vndertake to follow them any farther, fearing
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, i, 32.</note>
least he should haue gotten <name>Antonius</name> displeasure by it. Notwithstanding,
 he led his armie against them that had rebelled, and conquered them
againe: amongst whom he besieged <name>Antiochus,</name> king of <placeName>Commagena</placeName>, who offered
to giue him a thousand talents to be pardoned his rebellion, and promised euer after
to be at <name>Antonius</name> commaundement. But <name>Ventidius</name> made him answere, that he should
send vnto <name>Antonius,</name> who was not farre off, &amp; would not suffer <name>Ventidius</name> to make any
peace with <name>Antiochus,</name> to the end that yet this litle exploit should passe in his name,
and that they should not thinke he did anything but by his Lieutenant <name>Ventidius.</name> The
siege grew very long, because they that were in the towne, seeing they could not be
receiued vppon no reasonable composition: determined valiantly to defend themselues
to the last man. Thus <name>Antonius</name> did nothing, and yet receiued great shame, repenting
 him much that he tooke not their first offer. And yet at last he was glad to
make truce with <name>Antiochus,</name> and to take three hundred talents for composition. Thus
after he had set order for the state &amp; affaires of <placeName>Syria</placeName>, he returned againe to <placeName>Athens</placeName>:
and hauing giuen <name>Ventidius</name> such honours as he deserued, he sent him to <placeName>Rome</placeName>, to
triumph for the <placeName>Parthians</placeName>. <name>Ventidius</name> was the onely man that euer triumphed of
the <placeName>Parthians</placeName> vntill this present day, a meane man borne, and of no noble house
nor family: who only came to that he attained vnto, through <name>Antonius</name> friendshippe,
the which deliuered him happie occasion to atchieue to great matters. And yet to
say truely, he did so well quit himselfe in all his enterprises, that he
confirmed that which was spoken of <name>Antonius</name> and <name>C&aelig;sar:</name> to wit,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, i, 20.</note>
that they were alway more fortunate when they made warre by their
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, xi, 42.</note>
Lieutenants, then by themselues. For <name>Sossius,</name> one of <name>Antonius</name> Lieutenants
 in <placeName>Syria</placeName>, did notable good seruice: and <name>Canidius</name> whom he had also left his
Lieutenant in the borders of <placeName>Armenia</placeName>, did conquer it all. So did he also ouercome
<pb n="396"/>
the kings of the <placeName>Iberians</placeName> and <placeName>Albanians</placeName>, and went on with his conquests vnto
mount Caucasus. By these conquests, the fame of <name>Antonius</name> power increased more
and more, and grew dreadfull vnto all the barbarous nations. But <name>Antonius</name> notwithstanding,
 grew to be maruellously offended with <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> vpon certaine reportes that
had beene brought vnto him: and so tooke sea to go towards <placeName>Italy</placeName> with three hundred
 saile. And because those of <placeName>Brvndvsivm</placeName> would not receiue his armie into
their hauen, he went farther vnto <placeName>Tarentvm</placeName>. There his wife <name>Octauia</name> that came
out of <placeName>Grece</placeName> with him, besought him to send her vnto her brother:
the which he did. <name>Octauia</name> at that time was great with child, and
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, iv, 27.</note>
moreouer had a second daughter by him, and yet she put her selfe
in iorney, and met with her brother <name>Octauius C&aelig;sar</name> by the way, who
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vi, 43.</note>
brought his two chiefe friends, <name>M&aelig;cenas</name> and <name>Agrippa</name> with him. She
tooke them aside, and with all the instance she could possible, intreated them they
would not suffer her that was the happiest woman of the worlde, to become now the
most wretched and vnfortunatest creature of all other. For now, said she, euery
mans eyes doe gaze on me, that am the sister of one of the Emperors and wife of the
other. And if the worst counsell take place, (which the goddes forbid) and that
they growe to warres: for your selues, it is vncertaine to which of them two the
goddes haue assigned the victorie, or ouerthrowe. But for me, on which side soeuer
victorie fall, my state can be but most miserable still. These wordes of <name>Octauia</name> so
softned <name>C&aelig;sars</name> heart, that he went quickly vnto <placeName>Tarentvm</placeName>. . . .</p>
<p><name>Antonius</name> also leauing his wife <name>Octauia</name> and litle children begotten of her with
<name>C&aelig;sar,</name> and his other children which he had by <name>Fuluia:</name> he went directly into <placeName>Asia.</placeName>
Then beganne this pestilent plague and mischiefe of <name>Cleopatraes</name> loue (which had
slept a long time, and seemed to haue beene vtterly forgotten, and that <name>Antonius</name>
had giuen place to better counsell) againe to kindle, and to be in force, so soone as
<name>Antonius</name> came neare vnto <placeName>Syria</placeName>. And in the end, the horse of the minde as <name>Plato</name>
termeth it, that is so hard of raine (I meane the vnreyned lust of concupiscence) did
put out of <name>Antonius</name> head, all honest and commendable thoughtes: for he sent <name>Fonteius
 Capito</name> to bring <name>Cleopatra</name> into <placeName>Syria</placeName>. Vnto whom, to welcome her, he gaue
no trifling things: but vnto that she had already, he added the prouinces of <placeName>Ph&oelig;nicia</placeName>,
 those of the nethermost <placeName>Syria</placeName>, the Ile of <placeName>Cyprvs</placeName>, and a great part of <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>,
and that countrey of <placeName>Ivry</placeName>, where the true balme is, and that part of <placeName>Arabia</placeName> where
the <placeName>Nabatheians</placeName> doe dwell, which stretcheth out towardes the Ocean. These great
giftes much misliked the <placeName>Romaines</placeName>. But now, though <name>Antonius</name> did easily giue
away great seigniories, realmes, and mighty nations vnto some priuate men, and that
also he tooke from other kings their lawfull realms (as from <name>Antigonus</name> king of the
<placeName>Ievves</placeName>, whom he openly beheaded, where neuer king before had suffered like
death) yet all this did not so much offend the <placeName>Romaines</placeName>, as the vnmeasurable
honors which he did vnto <name>Cleopatra.</name> But yet he did much more aggrauat their
malice and ill will towards him, because that <name>Cleopatra</name> hauing brought him two
twins, a sonne and a daughter, he named his son <name>Alexander,</name> and his daughter
<name>Cleopatra,</name> and gaue them to their surnames, the Sun to the one, and the moone to
the other. . . .</p>
<p>This so great and puisant army which made the <placeName>Indians</placeName> quake for fear, dwelling
about the country of the <placeName>Bactrians</placeName>, &amp; all <placeName>Asia</placeName> also to tremble: serued him to no
purpose, &amp; all for the loue he bare to <name>Cleopatra.</name> For the earnest great desire he had
to lie all winter with her, made him begin his warre out of due time, and for hast,
to put all in hazard, being so rauished and enchaunted with the sweete poison of her
<pb n="397"/>
loue, that he had no other thought but of her, and how he might quickly returne
againe: more then how he might ouercome his enemies. . . .</p>
<p>Then seeing him selfe enuironned of all sides, he sent vnto the army, that they
should come and aide him: but there the Captaines that led the legions (among the
which <name>Canidius,</name> a man of great estimation about <name>Antonius</name> made one) committed
many faults.</p>
<p>Now whilest <name>Antonius</name> was busie in this preparation, <name>Octauia</name> his wife, whom he
had left at <placeName>Rome</placeName>, would needes take sea to come vnto him. Her brother <name>Octauius
C&aelig;sar</name> was willing vnto it, not for his respect at all (as most authors doe report) as
for that he might haue an honest colour to make warre with <name>Antonius</name> if he did misuse
 her, and not esteeme of her as she ought to be. But when she was come to
<placeName>Athens</placeName>, she receiued letters from <name>Antonius,</name> willing her to stay there vntill his comming,
 &amp; did aduertise her of his iorney and determination. The which though it
grieued her much, and that she knew it was but an excuse: yet by her letters to him
of aunswere, she asked him whether he would haue those things sent vnto him which
she had brought him, being great store of apparell for souldiers, a great number of
horse, summe of money and gifts, to bestow on his friends and Captaines he had
about him: and besides all those, she had two thousande souldiers chosen men, all
well armed like vnto the Pr&aelig;tors bands. When <name>Niger,</name> one of <name>Antonius</name> friendes
whom he had sent vnto <placeName>Athens</placeName>, had brought these newes from his wife <name>Octauia,</name>
and withall did greatly praise her, as she was worthy, and well deserued: <name>Cleopatra</name>
knowing that <name>Octauia</name> would haue <name>Antonius</name> from her, and fearing also that if with
her vertue and honest behauior, (besides the great power of her brother <name>C&aelig;sar</name>) she
did adde thereunto her modest kind loue to please her husband that she would then
be too strong for her, and in the end winne him away: she subtilly seemed to languish
 for the loue of <name>Antonius,</name> pining her body for lacke of meate. Furthermore,
she euery way so framed her countenance, that when <name>Antonius</name> came to see her, she
cast her eyes vpon him, like a woman rauished for ioy. Straight againe when he
went from her, she fell a weeping and blubbering, looked ruefully of the matter, and
still found she meanes that <name>Antonius</name> should oftentimes finde her weeping: and then
when he came sodainely vppon her, she made as though she dried her eyes, and
turned her face away, as if she were vnwilling that he should see her weepe. . . .</p>
<p>When <name>Octauia</name> was returned to <placeName>Rome</placeName> from <placeName>Athens</placeName>, <name>C&aelig;sar</name> commanded her to
goe out of <name>Antonius</name> house, and to dwell by herselfe, because he had abused her.
<name>Octauia</name> answered him againe, that she would not forsake her husbands house, and
that if he had no other occasion to make warre with him, she prayed him then to
take no thought for her: for sayed she, it were too shamefull a thing, that two
famous Captaines should bring in ciuill warres among the <placeName>Romains</placeName>, the one for the
loue of a woman, and the other for the iealousie betwixt one another. Now as she
spake the word, so did she also performe the deede. For she kept still in <name>Antonius</name>
house, as if he had bene there, and very honestly, and honorably kept his children.
not those onely she had by him, but the other which her husband had by <name>Fuluia.</name>
Furthermore, when <name>Antonius</name> sent any of his men to <placeName>Rome</placeName>, to sue for any office in
the common wealth: she receiued him very curteously, and so vsed her selfe vnto
her brother, that she obtained the thing she requested. Howbeit thereby, thinking
no hurt, she did <name>Antonius</name> great hurt. For her honest loue and regard to her husband,
 made euery man hate him, when they sawe he did so vnkindly vse so noble
a Ladie: but yet the greatest cause of their malice vnto him, was for the diuision of
lands he made amongst his children in the citie of <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>. And to confesse
<pb n="398"/>
a troth, it was too arrogant and insolent a part, and done (as a man would say) in
derision and contempt of the <placeName>Romains</placeName>. For he assembled all the people in the
shew place, where young men doe exercise themselues, and there vppon a high
tribunall siluered, he set two chaires of gold, the one for himselfe,
and the other for <name>Cleopatra,</name> and lower chaires for his children: then
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vi, 3.</note>
he openly published before the assembly, that first of all he did
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vi, 11.</note>
establish <name>Cleopatra</name> Queene of <placeName>&AElig;gypt</placeName>, of <placeName>Cyprys</placeName>, of <placeName>Lydia</placeName>, and
of the lower <placeName>Syria</placeName>, and at that time also, <name>C&aelig;sarion</name> king of the same
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vi, 7.</note>
realmes. This <name>C&aelig;sarion</name> was supposed to be the sonne of <name>Iulius
C&aelig;sar,</name> who had left <name>Cleopatra</name> great with child. Secondly he called the sonnes he
had by her, the kings of kings, &amp; gaue <name>Alexander</name> for his portion, <placeName>Armenia, Media</placeName>,
and <placeName>Parthia</placeName>, when he had conquered the countrie: and vnto <name>Ptolomy</name>
for his portion, <placeName>Phenicia, Syria</placeName>, and <placeName>Cilicia</placeName>. And therwithall
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vi, 16.</note>
he brought out <name>Alexander</name> in a long gowne after the fashion of the
<placeName>Medes</placeName> with a high copped tanke hat on his head, narrow in the toppe, as the kings
of the <placeName>Medes</placeName> and <placeName>Armenians</placeName> doe vse to weare them: and <name>Ptolomy</name> apparelled in a
cloke after the <placeName>Macedonian</placeName> maner, with slippers on his feete, and a broad hat, with
a royal band or diademe. Such was the apparell and old attire of the auncient
kings and successours of <name>Alexander</name> the great. So after his sonnes had done their
humble duties, and kissed their father and mother: presently a company of <placeName>Armenian</placeName>
 souldiers set there of purpose, compassed the one about, and a like company
of the <placeName>Macedonians</placeName> the other. Now for <name>Cleopatra,</name> she did not only weare at that
time, (but at all other times els when she came abroad) the apparell of the goddesse
<name>Isis,</name> and so gaue audience vnto all her subiects, as a new <name>Isis. Octauius C&aelig;sar</name>
reporting all these things vnto the Senate, and oftentimes accusing him to the whole
people and assembly in <placeName>Rome</placeName>: he thereby stirred vp all the <placeName>Romains</placeName> against him.
<name>Antonius</name> on the other side sent to <placeName>Rome</placeName> likewise to accuse him, and the chiefest
pointes of his accusations he charged him with, were these. First,
that hauing spoiled <name>Sextus</name> Pompeius in <placeName>Sicile</placeName>, he did not giue him
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vi, 18.</note>
his part of the Ile. Secondly, that he did detayne in his hands the
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vi, 27.</note>
shippes he lent him to make that warre. Thirdly, that hauing put
<name>Lepidus</name> their companion and triumuirate out of his part of the Empire, and hauing
depriued him of all honors: he retayned for him selfe the lands and reuenues thereof,
which had bene assigned vnto him for his part. And last of all, that he had in
manner deuided all <placeName>Italy</placeName> amongest his owne souldiers, and had left no part of it
for his souldiers. <name>Octauius C&aelig;sar</name> aunswered him againe: that for <name>Lepidus,</name> he had
in deede deposed him, and taken his part of the Empire from him, because he did
ouercruelly vse his authoritie. And secondly, for the conquests he had made by
force of armes, he was contented <name>Antonius</name> should haue his part of them, so that he
would likewise let him haue his part of <placeName>Armenia</placeName>. And thirdly, that for his souldiers,
 they should seeke for nothing in <placeName>Italy</placeName>, because they possessed <placeName>Media</placeName> and
<placeName>Parthia</placeName>, the which prouinces they had added to the Empire of <placeName>Rome</placeName>, valiantly
fighting with their Emperor and Captaine. <name>Antonius</name> hearing these newes, being
yet in <placeName>Armenia</placeName>, commaunded <name>Canidius</name> to goe presently to the sea side with his sixteene
 legions he had: and he himselfe with <name>Cleopatra,</name> went vnto the citie of <placeName>Ephesvs</placeName>,
 and there gathered together his gallies and shippes out of all partes, which
came to the number of eight hundreth, reckoning the great shippes of burden: and
of those <name>Cleopatra</name> furnished him with two hundreth, and twenty thousand talents
besides, &amp; prouision of victuals also to mainteine all the whole armie in this warre.
<pb n="399"/>
So <name>Antonius,</name> through the perswasions of <name>Domitius,</name> commaunded <name>Cleopatra,</name> to returne
againe into <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and there to vnderstand the successe of this warre. But <name>Cleopatra,</name>
 fearing least <name>Antonius</name> should againe be made friends with <name>Octauius C&aelig;sar,</name>
by the meanes of his wife <name>Octauia</name>: she so plyed <name>Canidius</name> with money, and filled
his purse, that he became her spokesman vnto <name>Antonius,</name> and told him there was no
reason to send her from this war, who defraied so great a charge: neither that it was
for his profit, because that thereby the <placeName>&AElig;gyptians</placeName> would then be vtterly discoraged,
which were the chiefest strength of the armie by sea: considering that he could see
no king of all the kings their confederates, that <name>Cleopatra</name> was inferior vnto, either
for wisedom or iudgement, seeing that long before she had wisely gouerned so great
a realme as <placeName>&AElig;gypt</placeName>, &amp; besides that she had bene so long acquainted with him, by
whom she had learned to manedge great affaires. These faire perswasions wanne
him: for it was predestined that the gouernment of all the world should fall into
<name>Octauius C&aelig;sars</name> handes. <name>Octauius C&aelig;sar</name> vnderstanding the sodaine
&amp; wonderfull great preparation of <name>Antonius,</name> he was not a litle
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, iv, 30.</note>
astonied at it, (fearing he should be driuen to fight that sommer)
because he wanted many things, &amp; the great and grieuous exactions of money did
sorely oppresse the people. . . .</p>
<p>Furthermore, <name>Titius</name> and <name>Plancus</name> (two of <name>Antonius</name> chiefest friendes and that had
bene both of them Consuls) for the great iniuries <name>Cleopatra</name> did them, because they
hindred all they could, that she should not come to this warre: they went and yeelded
themselues vnto <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> and tolde him where the testament was that
<name>Antonius</name> had made, knowing perfitly what was in it. The will was
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, iv, 5.</note>
in the custody of the <name>Vestall Nunnes:</name> of whom <name>C&aelig;sar</name> demanded for
it. They answered him, that they would not giue it him: but if he
would goe and take it, they would not hinder him. Thereupon <name>C&aelig;sar</name> went thither,
&amp; hauing read it first to himselfe, he noted certen places worthy of
reproch: so assembling all the Senate, he read it before them all. . . .
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, iv, 5.</note></p>
<p>Now after that <name>C&aelig;sar</name> had made sufficient preparation, he proclaimed
 open warre against <name>Cleopatra,</name> and made the people to
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vii, 7.</note>
abolish the power and Empire of <name>Antonius,</name> because he had before
giuen it vp vnto a woman. And <name>C&aelig;sar</name> sayed furthermore, that <name>Antonius</name> was not
Maister of himselfe, but that <name>Cleopatra</name> had brought him beside himselfe, by her
charmes and amarous poysons: and that they that shoulde make
warre with them, should be <name>Mardian</name> the Eunuch, <name>Photinus,</name> and
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vii, 17.</note>
<name>Iras,</name> a woman of <name>Cleopatraes</name> bedchamber, that frizeled her haire,
and dressed her head, and <name>Charmion,</name> the which were those that
ruled all the affaires of <name>Antonius</name> Empire. Before this warre as it is reported,
many signes and wonders fell out. . . . The Admiral galley of
<name>Cleopatra,</name> was called <name>Antoniade,</name> in the which there chanced a
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, x, 6.</note>
maruellous ill signe. Swallowes had bred vnder the poop of her
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, xii, 7.</note>
ship, and there came others after them that draue away the first, and
plucked down their neasts. Now when all things were readie, &amp; that they drew neare
to fight: it was found that <name>Antonius</name> had no lesse then fiue hundreth good ships of war,
among which there were many gallies that had eight &amp; ten bancks of owers, the which
were sumptuously furnished, not so meete for fight, as for triumph: a
hundred thousand footmen, and twelue thousand horsemen, and had
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vi, 76.</note>
with him to aide him these kings and subiectes following. <name>Bocchus</name>
king of <placeName>Libya</placeName>, <name>Tarc&omacr;demus</name> king of high <placeName>Silicia</placeName>, <name>Archelaus</name> king of <placeName>Cappadocia</placeName>,
<pb n="400"/>
<name>Philadelphus</name> king of <placeName>Paphlagonia</placeName>, <name>Mithridates</name> king of <placeName>Comagena</placeName>, and <name>Adallas</name> king
of <placeName>Thracia</placeName>. All which were there euery man in person. The residue that were
absent sent their armies, as <name>Polemon</name> king of <placeName>Pont</placeName>, <name>Manchus</name> king of <placeName>Arabia</placeName>, <name>Herodes</name>
king of <placeName>Ivry</placeName>: and furthermore, <name>Amyntas</name> king of <placeName>Lycaonia</placeName>, &amp; of the <placeName>Galatians</placeName>:
and besides all these, he had all the aide the king of <placeName>Medes</placeName> sent vnto him. Now
for <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> he had two hundreth and fiftie ships of warre, fourescore thousand footmen,
 and well neare as many horsmen as his enemie <name>Antonius. Antonius</name> for his
part, had all vnder his dominion from <placeName>Armenia</placeName>, &amp; the riuer of Euphrates, vnto the
sea <placeName>Ionivm &amp; Illyricvm</placeName>. <name>Octauius C&aelig;sar</name> had also for his part, all that which was
in our <placeName>Hemisphere</placeName>, or halfe part of the world, from <placeName>Illyria</placeName>, unto the Ocean sea
vpon the west: then all from the Ocean, vnto mare Siculum: &amp; from <placeName>Africk</placeName>, all
that which is against <placeName>Italy</placeName>, as <placeName>Gavle</placeName>, &amp; <placeName>Spain</placeName>. Furthermore, all from the prouince
of <placeName>Cyrenia</placeName>, to <placeName>&AElig;thiopia</placeName>, was subiect vnto <name>Antonius.</name> Now <name>Antonius</name> was made
so subiect to a womans will, that though he was a great deale the stronger by land,
yet for <name>Cleopatraes</name> sake he would needes haue this battell tryed by sea: though he
sawe before his eyes, that for lacke of water-menne, his Captaines did prest by force
all sortes of men out of <placeName>Grece</placeName> that they could take vp in the field,
as trauellers, muletters, reapers, haruest men, and young boyes, and
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vii, 45.</note>
yet could they not sufficiently furnish his gallies: so that the most
parte of them were emptie, and could scant row, because they
lacked water-men enowe. But on the contrarie side <name>C&aelig;sars</name> shippes were not built
for pompe, high and great, onely for a fight and brauery, but they
were light of yarage: armed and furnished with water-men as many
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vii, 48.</note>
as they needed, and had them al in readines, in the hauens of
<placeName>Tarentvm</placeName>, &amp; <placeName>Brvndvsivm</placeName>. So <name>Octauius C&aelig;sar</name> sent vnto <name>Antonius,</name>
to will him to delay no more time, but to come on with his army into <placeName>Italy</placeName>: and
that for his owne part he would giue him safe harbor, to land without any trouble,
and that he would withdraw his armie from the sea, as farre as one horse could
runne, vntil he had put his army a shore, &amp; had lodged his men. <name>Antonius</name> on the
other side brauely sent him word againe, and chalenged the combat of him man to
man, though he were the elder: and that if he refused him so, he would then fight
a battell with him in the fields of <placeName>Pharsalia</placeName>, as <name>Iulius C&aelig;sar,</name> &amp; <name>Pompey</name> had done
before. Now whilst <name>Antonius</name> rode at anker, lying idlely in harbor at the head of
<placeName>Actium</placeName>, in the place where the citie of <placeName>Nicopolis</placeName> standeth at this present: <name>C&aelig;sar</name>
had quickly passed the sea Ionium, and taken a place called <placeName>Toryne</placeName>, before <name>Antonius</name>
vnderstoode that he had taken ship. . . .</p>
<p>Furthermore, he delt very friendly and courteously with <name>Domitius,</name> and against
<name>Cleopatraes</name> minde. For, he being sicke of an agew when he went
and tooke a litle boate to go vnto <name>C&aelig;sars</name> campe, <name>Antonius</name> was very
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, v, 18.</note>
sorie for it, but yet he sent after him all his cariage, traine, and men:
and the same <name>Domitius,</name> as though he gaue him to vnderstand that
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, ix, 27.</note>
he repented his open treason, he died immediately after. . . .</p>
<p>And <name>Canidius</name> also, who had charge of his armie by land, when time came to follow
<name>Antonius</name> determination: he turned him cleane contrarie, and counselled him to send
<name>Cleopatra</name> backe againe, and himselfe to retire into <placeName>Macedon</placeName>, to fight there on the
maine land. And furthermore told him, that <name>Dicomes</name> king of the <placeName>Getes</placeName>, promised
him to aid him with a great power: and that it should be no shame nor dishonor to
him to let <name>C&aelig;sar</name> haue the sea, (because himselfe and his men both had bene well
practised and exercised in battels by sea, in the warre of <placeName>Silicia</placeName> against <name>Sextus Pom-</name>
<pb n="401"/>
<name>peius</name>) but rather that he should doe against all reason, he hauing so great skill and
experience of battelles by land as he had, if he should not imploy the force and
valiantnes of so many lusty armed footemen as he had readie, but
would weaken his armie by deuiding them into shippes. But now
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vii, 52.</note>
notwithstanding all these good perswasions, <name>Cleopatra</name> forced him to
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vii, 54.</note>
put all to the hazard of battell by sea: considering with her selfe
how she might flie and prouide for her safetie, not to helpe him to win the victorie:
but to flie more easily after the battell lost. . . .</p>
<p>So when <name>Antonius</name> had determined to fight by sea, he set all the other shippes on
fire, but threescore ships of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and reserued onely but the best and greatest
gallies, from three bancks, vnto tenne bancks of owers. Into them he put two &amp;
twenty thousand fighting men, with two thousand darters &amp; slingers. Now as he
was setting his men in order of battel, there was a Captaine, and a valiant man, that
had serued <name>Antonius</name> in many battels &amp; conflicts, &amp; had all his body hacked and cut:
who as <name>Antonius</name> passed by him, cryed out vnto him &amp; said; O
noble Emperor, how commeth it to passe that you trust to these vile
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, vii, 76.</note>
brittle shippes? what doe you mistrust these wounds of mine and
this sword? let the <placeName>Egyptians</placeName> and <placeName>Phenicians</placeName> fight by sea, and
set vs on the maine land, where we vse to conquer, or to be slaine on our feete.
<name>Antonius</name> passed by him and said neuer a word, but onely beckned to him with his
hand &amp; head, as though he willed him to be of good courage, although indeed he
had no great courage himselfe. . . .</p>
<p>All that day and the three dayes following, the sea rose so high &amp; was so boisterous,
 that the battell was put off. The fift day the storme ceased, and the sea calmed
againe and then they rowed with force of owers in battell one against the other. . . .</p>
<p>Now <name>Publicola</name> seing <name>Agrippa</name> put forth his left wing of <name>C&aelig;sars</name> armie, to compasse
in <name>Antonius</name> shippes that fought: he was driuen also to loofe off to haue more roome,
&amp; going a litle at one side, to put those farther off that were affraid, and in the middest
 of the battell. For they were sore distressed by <name>Aruntius.</name>
Howbeit the battell was yet of euen hand, and the victorie doubtfull,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, x, 18.</note>
being indifferent to both: when sodainely they sawe the threescore
shippes of <name>Cleopatra</name> busie about their yard masts, and hoysing saile
to flie. So they fled through the middest of them that were in fight, for they had
bene placed behind the great shippes, &amp; did maruellously disorder the other shippes.
For the enemies them selues wondred much to see them saile in that sort, with ful
saile towards <placeName>Peloponnesvs</placeName>. There <name>Antonius</name> shewed plainly, that he had not
onely lost the courage and hart of an Emperor, but also of a valiant man, &amp; that he
was not his owne man: (prouing that true which an old man spake in myrth, that
the soule of a louer liued in another body, and not in his owne) he was so caried
away with the vaine loue of this woman, as if he had bene glued vnto her, &amp; that
she could not haue remoued without mouing of him also. For when he saw <name>Cleopatraes</name>
 shippe vnder saile, he forgot, forsook, &amp; betrayed them that fought for him,
&amp; imbarked vpon a galley with fiue bankes of owers, to follow her
that was already begun to ouerthrow him, &amp; would in the end be
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, x, 29.</note>
his vtter destruction. When she knew his galley a farre off, she lift
vp a signe in the poope of her shippe, and so <name>Antonius</name> coming to it,
was pluckt vp where <name>Cleopatra</name> was, howbeit he saw her not at his first comming,
nor she him, but went and sate downe alone in the prow of his shippe, and saied
neuer a word, clapping his head betweene both his hands. . . .
<pb n="402"/>
After <name>Eurycles</name> had left <name>Antonius,</name> he returned againe to his place, and sate downe,
speaking neuer a word as he did before: and so liued three dayes alone, without
speaking to any man. But when he arriued at the head of T&aelig;narus,
there <name>Cleopatraes</name> women first brought <name>Antonius</name> and <name>Cleopatra</name> to
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, xi, 28.</note>
speake together, and afterwards, to suppe and lye together. Then
beganne there againe a great number of Marchaunts shippes to gather
about them, and some of their friends that had escaped from this ouerthrow: who
brought newes, that his army by sea was ouerthrown, but that they thought the army
by land was yet whole. Then <name>Antonius</name> sent vnto <name>Canidius,</name> to return with his army
into <placeName>Asia</placeName>, by <placeName>Macedon</placeName>. Now for himself, he determined to crosse
ouer into <placeName>Africk</placeName>, &amp; took one of his carects or hulks loden with
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, xi, 23.</note>
gold, siluer, and other rich cariage, &amp; gaue it vnto his friends: commanding
 them to depart, and to seeke to saue themselues. They
answered him weeping, that they would neither doe it, nor yet forsake him. Then
<name>Antonius</name> verie courteously and louingly did comfort them, and prayed them to depart:
and wrote vnto <name>Theophilus</name> gouernor of <placeName>Corinthe</placeName>, that he would see them safe, and
helpe to hide them in some secret place, vntill they had made their way &amp; peace
with <name>C&aelig;sar. . . .</name></p>
<p>And thus it stood with <name>Antonius.</name> Now for his armie by sea, that fought before
the head or foreland of <placeName>Activm</placeName>: they helde out a long time, and
nothing troubled them more then a great boysterous winde that rose
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, xi, 2.</note>
full in the prooes of their shippes and yet with much a doe, his nauie
was at length ouerthrowen, fiue houres within night. . . .</p>
<p>But now to returne to <name>Antonius</name> againe. <name>Canidius</name> himselfe came to bring him
newes, that he had lost all his armie by land at <placeName>Activn</placeName>: on the other side he was
aduertised also, that <name>Herodes</name> king of <placeName>Ivrie</placeName>, who had also certen legions and bandes
with him, was reuolted vnto <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> and all the other kings in like manner: so that,
sauing those that were about him, he had none left him. All this notwithstanding
did nothing trouble him, and it seemed that he was contented to forgoe all his hope,
and so to be ridde of all his care and troubles. Thereupon he left his solitarie house
he had built by the sea which he called Timoneon, and <name>Cleopatra</name> receiued him into
her royall pallace. He was no sooner com thither, but he straight set all the citie on
rioting and banquetting againe, and himselfe to liberalitie and giftes. He caused the
sonne of <name>Iulius C&aelig;sar</name> &amp; <name>Cleopatra,</name> to be enrolled (according to the manner of the
<placeName>Romains</placeName>) amongst the number of young men: and gaue <name>Antyllus,</name> his eldest son he
had by <name>Fuluia,</name> the mans gown, the which was a plaine gowne, without gard or
embroderie of purple. For these things, there was kept great feasting,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, xiii, 3.</note>
banquetting and dancing in <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> many dayes together.
In deede they did breake their first order they had set downe, which
they called Amimetobion, (as much to say, no life comparable) &amp; did set vp another,
which they called Synapothanumenon (signifying the order and agreement of those that
will dye together) the which in exceeding sumptuousnes, and cost was not inferior to
the first. For their friendes made themselues to be inrolled in this order of those that
would die together, and so made great feastes one to another: for euerie man when it
came to his turne, feasted their whole companie and fraternitie. <name>Cleopatra</name> in the meane
time was verie carefull in gathering all sorts of poysons together, to destroy men.
Now to make proofe of those poysons which made men die with least paine, she tryed
it vpon condemned men in prison. For when she saw the poysons that were sodaine
and vehement, and brought speedy death with grieuous torments: &amp; in contrary
<pb n="403"/>
manner, that such as were more milde and gentle, had not that quicke speede and
force to make one dye sodainely: she afterwardes went about to proue the stinging
of snakes and adders, and made some to be applyed vnto men in her sight, some in
one sorte and some in another. So when she had daily made diuers and sundrie
proofes, she found none of them all she had proued so fit, as the biting of an Aspick,
the which causeth onely a heauines of the head, without swounding or complaining,
and bringeth a great desire also to sleepe, with a litle swet in the face, and so by litle
and litle taketh away the senses &amp; vitall powers, no liuing creature perceiuing that
the patients feele any paine. For they are so sorie when any bodie awaketh them,
and taketh them vp: as those that being taken out of a sound sleep, are very heauie
and desirous to sleepe. This notwithstanding, they sent Ambassadors vnto <name>Octauius
C&aelig;sar</name> in <placeName>Asia</placeName>, <name>Cleopatra</name> requesting the realme of <placeName>&AElig;gypt</placeName> for their children, and
<name>Antonius</name> praying that he might be suffered to liue at <placeName>Athens</placeName> like a priuate m&amacr;, if
<name>C&aelig;sar</name> would not let him remaine in <placeName>&AElig;gypt</placeName>. And because they had no other men
of estimation about them, for that some were fled, and those that
remained, they did not greatly trust them: they were inforced to
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, xii, 9.</note>
send <name>Euphronius</name> the schoolemaister of their children. For <name>Alexas</name>
<placeName>Laodician</placeName>, who was brought into <name>Antonius</name> house &amp; fauour by
meanes of <name>Timagenes,</name> and afterwards was in greater credit with him, then any other
<placeName>Grecian</placeName>: (for that he had alway bene one of <name>Cleopatraes</name> ministers to win <name>Antonius,</name>
&amp; to ouerthrow all his good determinations to vse his wife <name>Octauia</name> well) him <name>Antonius</name>
had sent vnto <name>Herodes</name> king of <placeName>Ivrie</placeName>, hoping still to keepe him his friend, that he
should not reuolt from him. But he remained there, and betrayed <name>Antonius.</name> For
where he should haue kept <name>Herodes</name> fr&omacr; reuolting from him, he
perswaded him to turne to <name>C&aelig;sar:</name> &amp; trusting king <name>Herodes,</name> he presumed
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, vi, 17.</note>
to come in <name>C&aelig;sars</name> presence. Howbeit <name>Herodes</name> did him no
pleasure: for he was presently taken prisoner, and sent in chaines to
his own country, &amp; there by <name>C&aelig;sars</name> commaundement put to death. Thus was <name>Alexas</name>
in <name>Antonius</name> life time put to death, for betraying of him. Furthermore, <name>C&aelig;sar</name> would
not graunt vnto <name>Antonius</name> requestes: but for <name>Cleopatra,</name> he made her aunswere, that
he would deny her nothing reasonable, so that she would either put <name>Antonius</name> to
death, or driue him out of her country. There withall he sent
<name>Thyreus</name> one of his men vnto her, a very wise and discreet man,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, xii, 38.</note>
who bringing letters of credit from a young Lord vnto a noble Lady,
and that besides greatly liked her beautie, might easily by his eloquence
 haue perswaded her. He was longer in talke with her then any man else
was, and the Queene her selfe also did him great honour: in somuch as he made
<name>Antonius</name> ielous of him. Whereupon <name>Antonius</name> caused him to be
taken and well fauoredly whipped, and so sent him vnto <name>C&aelig;sar</name>:
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, xiii, 122.</note>
and bad him tell him that he made him angry with him, because
he shewed himselfe proude and disdainfull towardes him, and now
specially when he was easie to be angred, by reason of his present miserie. To be
short, if this mislike thee sayd he, thou hast <name>Hipparchus</name> one of my infranchised
bondmen with thee: hang him if thou wilt, or whippe him at thy pleasure, that we
may crie quittaunce. From thenceforth, <name>Cleopatra</name> to cleare her selfe of the suspition
he had of her, she made more of him then euer she did. For first
of all, where she did solemnise the day of her birth very meanely
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">III, xiii, 219.</note>
and sparingly, fit for her present misfortune: she now in contrary
maner did keepe it with such solemnitie, that she exceeded all measure of sumptuousnesse 
<pb n="404"/>
and magnificence: so that the guestes that were bidden to the
feasts, and came poore, went away rich. Now things passing thus, <name>Agrippa</name> by
diuers letters sent one after an other vnto <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> prayed him to returne to <placeName>Rome</placeName>,
because the affaires there did of necessitie require his person and presence. Thereupon
 he did deferre the warre till the next yeare following: but when winter was
done, he returned againe through <placeName>Syria</placeName> by the coast of <placeName>Africke</placeName>, to make warres
against <name>Antonius,</name> and his other Captaines. When the citie of <placeName>Pelvsivm</placeName> was taken,
there ran a rumor in the citie, that <name>Seleucus,</name> by <name>Cleopatraes</name> consent, had surrendered
the same. But to cleare her selfe that she did not, <name>Cleopatra</name> brought <name>Seleucus</name> wife
and children vnto <name>Antonius,</name> to be reuenged of them at his pleasure. Furthermore,
<name>Cleopatra</name> had long before made many sumptuous tombes and monuments, as well
for excellencie of workemanship, as for hight and greatnesse of building, ioyning
hard to the temple of <name>Isis.</name> Thither she caused to be brought all the treasure and
pretious things she had of the auncient kings her predecessours: as gold, siluer,
emerods, pearles, ebbonie, iuorie, and sinamon, and besides all that, a maruellous
number of torches, faggots, and flaxe. So <name>Octauius C&aelig;sar</name> being affrayed to loose
such a treasure and masse of richesse, and that this woman for spight would set it a
fire, and burne it euery whit: he alwayes sent some one or other vnto her from him,
to put her in good comfort, whilest he in the meane time drew neare the citie with
his armie. So <name>C&aelig;sar</name> came, and pitched his campe hard by the citie, in the place
where they runne and manage their horses. <name>Antonius</name> made a saly vpon him, and
fought very valiantly, so that he draue <name>C&aelig;sars</name> horsemen backe, fighting with his
men euen into their campe. Then he came againe to the pallace, greatly boasting
of this victorie, and sweetely kissed <name>Cleopatra,</name> armed as he was, when he came from
the fight, recommending one of his men of armes vnto her, that had
valiantly fought in this skirmish. <name>Cleopatra</name> to reward his manlinesse,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, viii, 34.</note>
gaue him an armour &amp; head peece of cleane gold: howbeit
the man at armes when he had receiued this rich gift, stale away by
night, and went to <name>C&aelig;sar? Antonius</name> sent againe to chalenge <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> to fight with
him hand to hand. <name>C&aelig;sar</name> aunswered him, that he had many other
wayes to dye then so. Then <name>Antonius</name> seeing there was no way
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, i, 7.</note>
more honourable for him to dye, then fighting valiantly: he determined 
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, ii, 38.</note>
to set vp his rest, both by sea and land. So being at supper,
(as it is reported) he commaunded his officers and household seruaunts
 that waited on him at his bord, that they should fill his cuppes full, and
make as much of him as they could: for sayd he, you know not whether you shall
do so much for me to morrow or not, or whether you shall serue an other maister:
and it may be you shall see me no more, but a dead body. This notwithstanding,
perceiuing that his friends and men fell a weeping to heare him say so: to salue
that he had spoken, he added this more vnto it, that he would not lead them to battell,
 where he thought not rather safely to returne with victorie, then valiantly to dye
with honour. Furthermore, the selfe same night within litle of midnight, when all
the citie was quiet, full of feare, and sorrow, thinking what would be the issue and
end of this warre: it is sayd that sodainly they heard a maruellous
sweete harmonie of sundry sortes of instrumentes of musicke, with
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, iii, 20.</note>
the crie of a multitude of people, as they had bene dauncing, and
had song as they vse in <name>Bacchus</name> feasts, with mouings and turnings
after the manner of the Satyres: and it seemed that this daunce went through the
city vnto the gate that opened to the enemies, and that all the troupe that made this
<pb n="405"/>
noyse they heard, went out of the citie at that gate. Now, such as in reason sought
the depth of the interpretation of this wonder, thought that it was the god vnto whom
<name>Antonius</name> bare singular deuotion to counterfeit and resemble him, that did forsake
them. The next morning by breake of day, he went to set those few footemen he
had in order vpon the hils adioyning vnto the citie: and there he
stood to behold his gallies which departed from the hauen, and
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, x, 9.</note>
rowed against the gallies of his enemies, and so stood still, looking
what exploit his souldiers in them would do. But when by force
of rowing they were come neare vnto them, they first saluted <name>C&aelig;sars</name> men: and then
<name>C&aelig;sars</name> men resaluted them also, and of two armies made but one, and then did all
together row toward the citie. When <name>Antonius</name> saw that his men did forsake him,
and yeelded vnto <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> and that his footemen were broken and ouerthrowen: he
then fled into the citie, crying out that <name>Cleopatra</name> had betrayed him vnto them, with
whom he had made warre for her sake. Th&emacr; she being affrayed of his fury, fled
into the tombe which she had caused to be made, and there locked
the doores vnto her, and shut all the springs of the lockes with great
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, xiii, 5.</note>
boltes, and in the meane time sent vnto <name>Antonius</name> to tell him that
she was dead. <name>Antonius</name> beleeuing it, sayd vnto himselfe: what
doest thou looke for further, <name>Antonius,</name> sith spightfull fortune hath taken from thee
the onely ioy thou haddest, for whom thou yet reseruedst thy life? when he had
sayd these words, he went into a chamber &amp; vnarmed himselfe, and being naked said
thus: O <name>Cleopatra,</name> it grieueth me not that I haue lost thy companie, for I will not
be long from thee: but I am sory, that hauing bene so great a Captaine and Emperour,
 I am indeede condemned to be iudged of lesse courage &amp; noble
minde, then a woman. Now he had a man of his called <name>Eros,</name>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, xiv, 72.</note>
whom he loued and trusted much, and whom he had long before
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, xiv, 97.</note>
caused to sweare vnto him, that he should kill him when he did
commaunde him: and then he willed him to keepe his promise.
His man drawing his sword, lift it vp as though he meant to haue striken his maister:
 but turning his head at one side, he thrust his sword into himselfe, and fell
downe dead at his maisters foote. Then sayd <name>Antonius,</name> O noble <name>Eros,</name> I thanke
thee for this, and it is valiantly done of thee, to shew me what I should do to my
selfe, which thou couldest not do for me. Therewithall he tooke his sword, and
thrust it into his bellie, and so fell downe vpon a litle bed. The wounde he had
killed him not presently, for the bloud stinted a litle when he was layed: and when
he came somewhat to himselfe againe, he prayed them that were about him to dispatch
 him. But they all fled out of the chamber, and left him crying out &amp; tormenting
 himselfe: vntill at last there came a Secretarie vnto him called <name>Diomedes,</name> who
was commaunded to bring him into the tombe or monument where <name>Cleopatra</name> was.
Wh&emacr; he heard that she was aliue, he very earnestly prayed his men to carie his body
thither, and so he was caried in his mens armes into the entry of the monument.
Notwithstanding, <name>Cleopatra</name> would not open the gates, but came to the high windowes,
 and cast out certaine chaines and ropes, in the which <name>Antonius</name> was trussed:
and <name>Cleopatra</name> her owne selfe, with two women onely, which she had suffered to
come with her into these monuments, trised <name>Antonius</name> vp. They that were present
to behold it, sayd they neuer saw so pitifull a sight. For, they plucked vp poore
<name>Antonius</name> all bloudy as he was, and drawing on with pangs of death, who holding
vp his hands to <name>Cleopatra,</name> raised vp himselfe as well as he could. It was a hard
thing for these women to do, to lift him vp: but <name>Cleopatra</name> stouping downe with her
<pb n="406"/>
head, putting all her strength to her vttermost power, did lift him vp with much
a do, and neuer let go her hold, with the helpe of the women beneath that bad her
be of good courage, and were as sory to see her labour so, as she her selfe. So
when she had gotten him in after that sort, and layed him on a bed: she rent her
garments vpon him, clapping her brest, and scratching her face and stomacke.
Then she dried vp his bloud that had berayed his face, and called him her Lord, her
husband, and Emperour, forgetting her owne miserie and calamity, for the pitie and
compasion she tooke of him. <name>Antonius</name> made her ceasse her lamenting,
 and called for wine, either because he was a thirst, or else for
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">IV, xv, 56.</note>
that he thought thereby to hasten his death. When he had dronke,
he earnestly prayed her, and perswaded her, that she would seeke
to saue her life, if she could possible, without reproche and dishonour: and that
cheifly she should trust <name>Proculeius</name> aboue any man else about <name>C&aelig;sar.</name> And as for
himselfe, that she should not lament nor sorow for the miserable chaunge of his fortune
 at the end of his dayes: but rather that she should thinke him the more fortunate,
 for the former triumphes &amp; honours he had receiued, considering that while he
liued he was the noblest and greatest Prince of the world, &amp; that now he was ouercome,
 not cowardly, but valiantly, a <placeName>Romaine</placeName> by an other <placeName>Romaine</placeName>. As <name>Antonius</name>
gaue the laste gaspe, <name>Proculeius</name> came that was sent fr&omacr; <name>C&aelig;sar.</name> For after <name>Antonius</name>
had thrust his sword in himselfe, as they caried him into the tombes
and monuments of <name>Cleopatra,</name> one of his gard called <name>Dercet&aelig;us,</name>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">V, i, 7.</note>
tooke his sword with the which he had striken himselfe, and hid it:
then he secretly stale away, and brought <name>Octauius C&aelig;sar</name> the first
newes of his death, &amp; shewed him his sword that was bloudied. <name>C&aelig;sar</name> hearing these
newes, straight withdrew himselfe into a secret place of his tent, and there burst out
with teares, lamenting his hard and miserable fortune, that had bene his friend and
brother in law, his equall in the Empire, and companion with him in sundry great
exploits and battels. Then he called for all his friendes, and shewed them the letters
<name>Antonius</name> had written to him, and his aunsweres also sent him againe, during their
quarrell and strife: and how fiercely and proudly the other aunswered him, to all
iust and reasonable matters he wrote vnto him. After this, he sent <name>Proculeius,</name> and
commaunded him to do what he could possible to get <name>Cleopatra</name> aliue, fearing least
otherwise all the treasure would be lost: &amp; furthermore, he thought that if he could
take <name>Cleopatra,</name> and bring her aliue to <placeName>Rome</placeName>, she would maruellously beautifie and
set out his triumphe. But <name>Cleopatra</name> would neuer put her selfe into <name>Proculeius</name> handes,
although they spake together. For <name>Proculeius</name> came to the gates that were very thicke
&amp; strong, and surely barred, but yet there were some cranewes through the which
her voyce might be heard, and so they without vnderstood, that <name>Cleopatra</name> demaunded
the kingdome of <placeName>&AElig;gypt</placeName> for her sonnes: and that <name>Proculeius</name> aunswered her, that she
should be of good cheare, and not be affrayed to referre all vnto <name>C&aelig;sar.</name> After he
had viewed the place very well, he came and reported her answere vnto <name>C&aelig;sar.</name>
Who immediately sent <name>Gallus</name> to speake once againe with her, and bad him purposely
 hold her with talke, whilest <name>Proculeius</name> did set vp a ladder against that high
window, by the which <name>Antonius</name> was trised vp, and came downe into the monument
with two of his men hard by the gate, where <name>Cleopatra</name> stood to heare what <name>Gallus</name>
sayd vnto her. One of her women which was shut in her monum&emacr;ts with her, saw
<name>Proculeius</name> by chance as he came downe, and shreeked out: O poore <name>Cleopatra,</name> thou
art taken. Then when she saw <name>Proculeius</name> behind her as she came from the gate,
she thought to haue stabbed her selfe in with a short dagger she wore of purpose by
<pb n="407"/>
her side. But <name>Proculeius</name> came sodainly vpon her, and taking her by both the hands,
sayd vnto her. <name>Cleopatra,</name> first thou shalt do thy selfe great wrong, and secondly vnto
<name>C&aelig;sar:</name> to depriue him of the occasion and oportunitie, openly to shew his bountie
and mercie, and to giue his enemies cause to accuse the most curteous and noble Prince
that euer was, and to appeache him, as though he were a cruell and mercilesse man,
that were not to be trusted. So euen as he spake the word, he tooke her dagger
from her, and shooke her clothes for feare of any poyson hidden about her. Afterwardes
 <name>C&aelig;sar</name> sent one of his infranchised men called <name>Epaphroditus,</name> whom he
straightly charged to looke well vnto her, and to beware in any case that she made
not her selfeaway: and for the rest, to vse her with all the curtesie possible. . . .</p>
<p>Therefore <name>C&aelig;sar</name> did put <name>C&aelig;sarion</name> to death, after the death of his mother <name>Cleopatra.</name>
 Many Princes, great kings &amp; Captaines did craue <name>Antonius</name> body of <name>Octauius
C&aelig;sar,</name> to giue him honourable buriall: but <name>C&aelig;sar</name> would neuer take it from <name>Cleopatra,</name>
who did sumptuously &amp; royally bury him with her own hands, whom <name>C&aelig;sar</name> suffred
to take as much as she would to bestow vpon his funerals. Now was she altogether
ouercome with sorow &amp; passion of minde, for she had knocked her brest so pitifully,
that she had martyred it, and in diuers places had raysed vlcers &amp; inflammations, so
that she fell into a feuer withall: whereof she was very glad, hoping
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">V, ii, 59.</note>
thereby to haue good colour to absteine from meate, and that so she
might haue dyed easily without any trouble. She had a Phisition
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">V, ii, 193.</note>
called <name>Olympus,</name> whom she made priuie of her intent, to the end he
should helpe her to rid her out of her life: as <name>Olympus</name> writeth himselfe, who wrote
a booke of all these things. But <name>C&aelig;sar</name> mistrusted the matter, by many coniectures
he had, and therefore did put her in feare, and threatned her to put her children to
shamefull death. With these threates, <name>Cleopatra</name> for feare yeelded straight, as she
would haue yeelded vnto strokes: &amp; afterwards suffred her selfe to be cured and
dieted as they listed. Shortly after, <name>C&aelig;sar</name> came himself in person to see her, &amp; to
c&omacr;fort her. <name>Cleopatra</name> being layed vpon a litle low bed in poore estate, when she
saw <name>C&aelig;sar</name> come into her chamber, she sodainly rose vp, naked in her smocke, and
fell downe at his feete maruellously disfigured: both for that she had plucked her haire
from her head, as also for that she had martired all her face with her nayles, and
besides, her voyce was small and trembling, her eyes sunke into her head with continuall
 blubbering and moreouer, they might see the most part of her stomake torne
in sunder. To be short, her body was not much better then her minde: yet her
good grace and comelynesse, and the force of her beautie was not altogether defaced.
But notwithstanding this ougly and pitifull state of hers, yet she shewed herselfe
within, by her outward lookes and countenance. When <name>C&aelig;sar</name> had made her lye
downe againe, and sate by her beds side: <name>Cleopatra</name> began to cleare and excuse her
selfe for that she had done, laying all to the feare she had of <name>Antonius: C&aelig;sar,</name> in
contrary manner, reproued her in euery point. Then she sodainly altered her
speach, and prayed him to pardon her, as though she were affrayed to dye, and
desirous to liue. At length, she gaue him a briefe and memoriall of all the ready
money and treasure she had. But by chaunce there stood <name>Seleucus</name> by, one of her
Treasurers, who to seeme a good seruant, came straight to <name>C&aelig;sar</name> to disproue <name>Cleopatra,</name>
 that she had not set in all, but kept many things backe of purpose. <name>Cleopatra</name>
was in such a rage with him, that she flew vpon him, &amp; tooke him by the haire of
the head, and boxed him welfauouredly. <name>C&aelig;sar</name> fell a laughing, and parted the
fray. Alas, sayd she, O <name>C&aelig;sar:</name> is not this a great shame and reproche, that thou
hauing vouchsaued to take the paines to come vnto me, and hast done me this honour, 
<pb n="408"/>
poore wretch, and caitife creature, brought into this pitifull and miserable estate:
and that mine owne seruants should come now to accuse me, though
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">V, ii, 168.</note>
it may be I haue reserued some iewels and trifles meete for women,
but not for me (poore soule) to set out my selfe withall, but meaning
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">V, ii, 200.</note>
to giue some pretie presents and giftes vnto <name>Octauia</name> and <name>Liuia,</name>
that they making meanes &amp; intercession for me to thee, thou mightest
yet extend thy fauour and mercy vpon me? <name>C&aelig;sar</name> was glad to heare her say so, perswading
 him selfe thereby that she had yet a desire to saue her life. So he made
her aunswere, that he did not onely giue her that to dispose of at her pleasure, which
she had kept backe, but further promised to vse her more honorably and bountifully
than she would thinke for: and so he tooke his leaue of her, supposing he had
deceiued her, but indeede he was deceiued himselfe. There was
a young gentleman <name>Cornelius Dolabella,</name> that was one of <name>C&aelig;sars</name> very
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">V, ii, 235.</note>
great familiars, &amp; besides did beare no euill wil vnto <name>Cleopatra.</name> He
sent her word secretly as she had requested him, that <name>C&aelig;sar</name> determined
to take his iorney through <placeName>Svria</placeName>, &amp; that within three daies he would send her away
before with her children. When this was told <name>Cleopatra,</name> she requested <name>C&aelig;sar</name> that
it would please him to suffer her to offer the last oblations of the dead, vnto the soule
of <name>Antonius.</name> This being graunted her, she was caried to the place where his tombe
was, and there falling downe on her knees, imbracing the tombe with her women,
&lsquo;the teares running down her cheekes, she began to speake in this sort: 

<q direct="unspecified">O my deare
Lord <name>Antonius,</name> not long sithence I buried thee here, being a free woman: and now
I offer vnto thee the funerall sprinklings and oblations, being a captiue and prisoner,
and yet I am forbidden and kept from tearing &amp; murthering this captiue body of mine
with blowes, which they carefully gard and keepe, only to triumphe of thee: look
therefore henceforth for no other honours, offerings, nor sacrifices from me, for these
are the last which <name>cleopatra</name> can giue thee, sith now they carie her away. Whilest
we liued together, nothing could seuer our companies: but now at our death, I feare
me they will make vs chaunge our countryes. For as thou being a <placeName>Romaine</placeName>, hast
bene buried in <placeName>&AElig;gypt</placeName>: euen so wretched creature I, an <placeName>&AElig;gyptian</placeName>, shall be buried
in <placeName>Italie</placeName>, which shall be all the good that I haue receiued by thy country. If therefore
the gods where thou art now haue any power &amp; authoritie, sith our gods here
haue forsak&emacr; vs: suffer not thy true friend and louer to be caried away aliue, that in
me, they triumphe of thee: but receiue me with thee, and let me be buried in one
selfe tombe with thee. For though my griefes and miseries be infinite, yet none hath
grieued me more, nor that I could lesse beare withall: then this small time, which
I haue bene driu&emacr; to liue alone without thee. </q>

Then hauing ended these dolefull
plaints, and crowned the tombe with garlands and sundry nosegayes, and maruellous
louingly imbraced the same: she commaunded they should prepare her bath, and
when she had bathed and washed her selfe, she fell to her meate, and was sumptuously
 serued. Now whilest she was at dinner, there came a countryman, and brought
her a basket. The souldiers that warded at the gates, asked straight what he had in
his basket. He opened the basket, and tooke out the leaues that couered the figges,
and shewed them that they were figges he brought. They all of them maruelled to
see so goodly figges. The countryman laughed to heare them, and bad them take
some if they would. They beleeued he told them truely, and so bad him carie them
in. After <name>Cleopatra</name> had dined, she sent a certaine table written and sealed vnto
<name>C&aelig;sar,</name> and commaunded them all to go out of the tombes where she was, but the
two women, then she shut the doores to her. <name>C&aelig;sar</name> when he receiued this table,
<pb n="409"/>
and began to read her lam&emacr;tation and petition, requesting him that he would let her
be buried with <name>Antonius,</name> found straight what she meant, and thought to haue gone
thither himselfe: howbeit he sent one before in all hast that might be, to see what it
was. Her death was very sodaine. For those whom <name>C&aelig;sar</name> sent vnto her ran thither
in all hast possible, &amp; found the souldiers standing at the gate, mistrusting nothing,
 nor vnderstanding of her death. But when they had opened the doores, they
found <name>Cleopatra</name> starke dead, layed vpon a bed of gold, attired &amp; arayed in her royall
 robes, and one of her two women, which was called <name>Iras,</name> dead at her feete: and
her other woman called <name>Charmion</name> halfe dead, and trembling, trimming
 the Diademe which <name>Cleopatra</name> ware vpon her head. One of
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">V, ii, 373.</note>
the souldiers seeing her, angrily sayd vnto her: is that well done
<name>Charmion?</name> Very well sayd she againe, and meete for a Princesse
discended from the race of so many noble kings. She sayd no more, but fell downe
dead hard by the bed. Some report that this Aspicke was brought vnto her in the
basket with figs, &amp; that she had commaunded them to hide it vnder the figge leaues,
that when she should thinke to take out the figges, the Aspicke should bite her before
she should see her: howbeit, that when she would haue taken away the leaues for
the figges, she perceiued it, and sayd, art thou here then? And so, her arme being
naked, she put it to the Aspicke to be bitten. Other say againe, she kept it in a
boxe, and that she did pricke and thrust it with a spindle of gold, so that the Aspicke
being angerd withall, lept out with great furie, and bit her in the arme. Howbeit
few can tell the troth. For they report also, that she had hidden poyson in a hollow
raser which she caried in the haire of her head: and yet was there no marke seene
of her body, or any signe discerned that she was poysoned, neither also did they finde
this serpent in her tombe. But it was reported onely, that there were seene certaine
fresh steppes or trackes where it had gone, on the tombe side toward the sea, and
specially by the doore side. Some say also, that they found two litle pretie bytings
in her arme, scant to be discerned: the which it seemeth <name>C&aelig;sar</name> himselfe
 gaue credit vnto, because in his triumphe he caried <name>Cleopatraes</name>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">V, ii, 422.</note>
image, with an Aspicke byting of her arme. And thus goeth the
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">V, ii, 429.</note>
report of her death. Now <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> though he was maruellous sory
for the death of <name>Cleopatra,</name> yet he wondred at her noble minde and
courage, and therefore commaunded she should be nobly buried, and layed by
<name>Antonius:</name> and willed also that her two women should haue honorable buriall.
<name>Cleopatra</name> dyed being eight and thirtie yeare old, after she had raigned two and
twenty yeares, and gouerned aboue foureteen of them with <name>Antonius.</name> And for
<name>Antonius,</name> some say that he liued three and fiftie yeares: and others say, six and
fiftie.</p>

<div1 type="preface"><head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>The death of <name>Anthony</name> and <name>Cleopatra,</name> is a Subject which has been treated by the
greatest Wits of our Nation, after <name>Shakespeare;</name> and by all so variously, that their
example has given me the confidence to try my self in this Bowe of <name>Ulysses</name> amongst
the Crowd of Sutors; and, withal, to take my own measures, in aiming at the Mark.
I doubt not but the same Motive has prevailed with all of us in this attempt; I mean
the excellency of the Moral: for the chief persons represented, were famous patterns
of unlawful love; and their end accordingly was unfortunate. All reasonable men
have long since concluded, That the Heroe of the Poem, ought not to be a character
of perfect Virtue, for, then, he could not, without injustice, be made unhappy; nor
yet altogether wicked, because he could not then be pitied: I have therefore steer'd
the middle course; and have drawn the character of <name>Anthony</name> as favourably as <name>Plutarch,
 Appian,</name> and <name>Dion Cassius</name> wou'd give me leave: the like I have observ'd in
<name>Cleopatra.</name> That which is wanting to work up the pity to a greater heighth, was not
afforded me by the story: for the crimes of love which they both committed, were not
occasion'd by any necessity, or fatal ignorance, but were wholly voluntary; since our
passions are, or ought to be, within our power. The Fabrick of the Play is regular
enough, as to the inferior parts of it; and the Unities of Time, Place and Action,
more exactly observed, than, perhaps, the English Theater requires. Particularly,
the Action is so much one, that it is the only of the kind without Episode, or Underplot;
 every Scene in the Tragedy conducing to the main design, and every Act concluding
 with a turn of it. The greatest errour in the contrivance seems to be in the
person of <name>Octavia:</name> For, though I might use the priviledge of a Poet, to introduce
her into <name>Alexandria,</name> yet I had not enough consider'd, that the compassion she mov'd
to her self and children, was destructive to that which I reserv'd for <name>Anthony</name> and
<name>Cleopatra;</name> whose mutual love being founded upon vice, must lessen the favour of
the Audience to them, when Virtue and Innocence were oppress'd by it. And,
though I justified <name>Anthony</name> in some measure, by making <name>Octavia's</name> departure, to proceed
 wholly from her self; yet the force of the first Machine still remain'd; and the
dividing of pity, like the cutting of a River into many Channels, abated the strength
of the natural stream. But this is an Objection which none of my Critiques have
urg'd against me; and therefore I might have let it pass, if I could have resolv'd to
have been partial to my self. The faults my Enemies have found, are rather cavils
concerning little, and not essential Decencies; which a Master of the Ceremonies
may decide betwixt us. The <emph>French</emph> Poets, I confess, are strict Observers of these
Punctilio's: They would not, for example, have suffer'd <name>Cleopatra</name> and <name>Octavia</name> to
have met; or if they had met, there must only have pass'd betwixt them some cold
civilities, but no eagerness of repart&eacute;e, for fear of offending against the greatness of
their Characters, and the modesty of their Sex. This Objection I foresaw, and at the
same time contemn'd: for I judg'd it both natural and probable, that <name>Octavia,</name> proud
of her new-gain'd Conquest, would search out <name>Cleopatra</name> to triumph over her; and
that <name>Cleopatra,</name> thus attacqu'd, was not of a spirit to shun the encounter: and 'tis
not unlikely, that two exasperated Rivals should use such Satyre as I have put into
their mouths; for after all, though the one were a <emph>Roman,</emph> and the other a Queen,
they were both Women. . . .</p>
<p>In my Stile I have profess'd to imitate the Divine <name>Shakespeare;</name> which that I
might perform more freely, I have disincumber'd my self from Rhyme. Not that I
condemn my former way, but that this is more proper to my present purpose. I hope
<pb n="411"/>
I need not to explain myself, that I have not Copy'd my Author servilely: Words
and Phrases must of necessity receive a change in succeeding Ages: but 'tis almost
a Miracle that much of his Language remains so pure; and that he who began Dramatique
 Poetry amongst us, untaught by any, and, as <name>Ben Johnson</name> tells us, without
Learning, should by the force of his own Genius perform so much, that in a manner
he has left no praise for any who come after him. The occasion is fair, and the subject
 would be pleasant to handle the difference of Stiles betwixt him and <name>Fletcher,</name>
and wherein, and how far they are both to be imitated. But since I must not be
over-confident of my own performance after him, it will be prudence in me to be
silent. Yet I hope I may affirm, and without vanity, that by imitating him, I have
excell'd my self throughout the Play; and particularly, that I prefer the Scene
betwixt <name>Anthony</name> and <name>Ventidius</name> in the first Act, to any thing which I have written
in this kind.</p></div1>

<lg type="group">
<l>What Flocks of Critiques hover here to day,</l>
<l>As Vultures wait on Armies for their Prey,</l>
<l>All gaping for the Carcass of a Play!</l>
</lg>
<l>With Croaking Notes they bode some dire event;</l>
<l>And follow dying Poets by the scent.</l>
<l>Ours gives himself for gone; y'have watch'd your time!</l>
<l>He fights this day unarm'd; without his Rhyme.</l>
<l>And brings a Tale which often has been told;</l>
<l>As sad as Dido's; and almost as old.</l>
<l>His Heroe, whom you Wits his Bully call,</l>
<l>Bates of his mettle; and scarce rants at all;</l>
<l>He's somewhat lewd; but a well-meaning mind;</l>
<l>Weeps much; fights little; but is wond'rous kind.</l>
<l>In short, a Pattern, and Companion fit,</l>
<l>For all the keeping Tonyes of the Pit.</l>
<lg type="group">
<l>I cou'd name more; a Wife and Mistress too;</l>
<l>Both (to be plain) too good for most of you:</l>
<l>The Wife well-natur'd, and the Mistress true.</l>
</lg>
<l>Now, Poets, if your fame has been his care;</l>
<l>Allow him all the candour you can spare.</l>
<l>A brave Man scorns to quarrel once a day;</l>
<l>Like Hectors, in at every petty fray.</l>
<l>Let those find fault whose Wit's so very small,</l>
<l>They've need to show that they can think at all:</l>
<l>Errours like Straws upon the surface flow;</l>
<l>He who would search for Pearls must dive below.</l>
<l>Fops may have leave to level all they can;</l>
<l>As Pigmies wou'd be glad to lopp a Man.</l>
<l>Half-Wits are Fleas; so little and so light;</l>
<l>We scarce cou'd know they live, but that they bite.</l>
<l>But, as the Rich, when tir'd with daily Feasts,</l>
<l>For change, become their next poor Tenants Ghests;</l>
<l>Drink hearty Draughts of Ale, from plain brown Bowls,</l>
<l>And snatch the homely Rasher from the Coals:
<pb n="412"/></l>
<l>So you, retiring from much better Cheer,</l>
<l>For once, may venture to do penance here.</l>
<l>And since that plenteous Autumn now is past,</l>
<l>Whose Grapes and Peaches have Indulged your taste,</l>
<l>Take in good part from our poor Poets boord,</l>
<l>Such rivell'd Fruits as Winter can afford.</l></div1>

<stage>Enter Serapion, Myris, Priests of Isis.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> Portents, and Prodigies, are grown so frequent,</l>
<l>That they have lost their Name. Our fruitful <name>Nile</name></l>
<l>Flow'd ere the wonted Season, with a Torrent</l>
<l>So unexpected, and so wondrous fierce,</l>
<l>That the wild Deluge overtook the haste</l>
<l>Ev'n of the Hinds that watch'd it: Men and Beasts</l>
<l>Were born above the tops of Trees, that grew</l>
<l>On th' utmost Margin of the Water-mark.</l>
<l>Then, with so swift an Ebb, the Floud drove backward</l>
<l>It slipt from underneath the Scaly Herd:</l>
<l>Here monstrous <name>Phoc&aelig;</name> panted on the Shore;</l>
<l>Forsaken <emph>Dolphins</emph> there, with their broad tails,</l>
<l>Lay lashing the departing Waves: Hard by 'em,</l>
<l>Sea-Horses floundring in the slimy mud,</l>
<l>Toss'd up their heads, and dash'd the ooze about 'em.
<stage>Enter Alexas behind them.</stage></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Myr.</speaker><l> Avert these Omens, Heav'n.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> Last night, between the hours of Twelve and One,</l>
<l>In a lone Isle o'th'Temple while I walk'd,</l>
<l>A Whirl-wind rose, that, with a violent blast,</l>
<l>Shook all the <emph>Dome:</emph> the Doors around me clapt,</l>
<l>The Iron Wicket, that defends the Vault,</l>
<l>Where the long Race of <name>Ptolomies</name> is lay'd,
<pb n="413"/></l>
<l>Burst open, and disclosed the mighty dead.</l>
<l>From out each Monument, in order plac'd,</l>
<l>An Armed Ghost start up: the Boy-King last</l>
<l>Rear'd his inglorious head. A peal of groans</l>
<l>Then follow'd, and a lamentable voice</l>
<l>Cry'd <name>&AElig;gypt</name> is no more. My blood ran back,</l>
<l>My shaking knees against each other knock'd;</l>
<l>On the cold pavement down I fell intranc'd;</l>
<l>And so unfinish'd left the horrid Scene.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alexas</speaker> <stage>(showing himself.)</stage><l> And, Dream'd you this? or, Did invent the Story?</l>
<l>To frighten our <mentioned>&AElig;gyptian</mentioned> Boys withal,</l>
<l>And train 'em up betimes in fear of Priesthood?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> My Lord, I saw you not,</l>
<l>Nor meant my words should reach your ears; but what</l>
<l>I uttered was most true.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> A foolish Dream,</l>
<l>Bred from the fumes of indigested Feasts,</l>
<l>And holy Luxury.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> I know my duty:</l>
<l>This goes no farther.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> 'Tis not fit it should.</l>
<l>Nor would the times now bear it, were it true.</l>
<l>All Southern, from you hills, the <mentioned>Roman</mentioned> Camp</l>
<l>Hangs o'er us black and threatning, like a Storm</l>
<l>Just breaking on our heads.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> Our faint <mentioned>&AElig;gyptians</mentioned> pray for <name>Antony;</name></l>
<l>But in their Servile hearts they own <name>Octavius.</name></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Myr.</speaker><l> Why then does <name>Antony</name> dream out his hours,</l>
<l>And tempts not Fortune for a noble Day,</l>
<l>Which might redeem, what <placeName>Actium</placeName> lost?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> He thinks 'tis past recovery.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> Yet the Foe</l>
<l>Seems not to press the Siege.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> O, there's the wonder.</l>
<l><name>Mec&aelig;nas</name> and <name>Agrippa,</name> who can most</l>
<l>With <name>C&aelig;sar,</name> are his Foes. His Wife <name>Octavia,</name></l>
<l>Driv'n from his House, solicits her revenge;</l>
<l>And <name>Dolabella,</name> who was once his Friend,</l>
<l>Upon some private grudge, now seeks his ruine:</l>
<l>Yet still War seems on either side to sleep.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> 'Tis strange that <name>Antony,</name> for some days past,</l>
<l>Has not beheld the face of <name>Cleopatra;</name></l>
<l>But here, in <placeName>Isis</placeName> Temple, lives retir'd,</l>
<l>And makes his heart a prey to black despair.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> 'Tis true; and we much fear he hopes by absence</l>
<l>To cure his mind of Love.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> If he be vanquish'd,</l>
<l>Or make his peace, <placeName>&AElig;gypt</placeName> is doom'd to be</l>
<l>A <mentioned>Roman</mentioned> Province; and our plenteous Harvests
<pb n="414"/></l>
<l>Must then redeem the scarceness of their Soil.</l>
<l>While <name>Antony</name> stood firm, our <mentioned>Alexandria</mentioned></l>
<l>Rival'd proud <placeName>Rome</placeName> (Dominions other Seat)</l>
<l>And Fortune striding, like a vast <mentioned>Colossus,</mentioned></l>
<l>Cou'd fix an equal foot of Empire here.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> Had I my wish, these Tyrants of all Nature</l>
<l>Who Lord it o'er Mankind, should perish, perish,</l>
<l>Each by the others Sword; but, since our will</l>
<l>Is lamely follow'd by our pow'r, we must</l>
<l>Depend on one; with him to rise or fall.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> How stands the Queen affected?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> O, she dotes,</l>
<l>She dotes, <name>Serapion,</name> on this vanquish'd Man,</l>
<l>And winds her self about his mighty ruins,</l>
<l>Whom would she yet forsake, yet yield him up,</l>
<l>This hunted prey, to his pursuers hands,</l>
<l>She might preserve us all; but 'tis in vain&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l>
<l>This changes my designs, this blasts my Counsels,</l>
<l>And makes me use all means to keep him here,</l>
<l>Whom I could wish divided from her Arms</l>
<l>Far as the Earth's deep Center. Well, you know</l>
<l>The state of things; no more of your ill Omens,</l>
<l>And black Prognosticks; labour to confirm</l>
<l>The peoples hearts.
<stage>Enter Ventidius, talking aside with a Gentleman of Antony's.</stage></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> These <mentioned>Romans</mentioned> will o'rehear us.</l>
<l>But, Who's that Stranger? By his Warlike port,</l>
<l>His fierce demeanor, and erected look,</l>
<l>He's of no vulgar note.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> O, 'tis <name>Ventidius,</name></l>
<l>Our Emp'rors great Lieutenant in the East,</l>
<l>Who first show'd <placeName>Rome</placeName> that Parthia could be conquer'd.</l>
<l>When <name>Antony</name> return'd from <mentioned>Syria</mentioned> last,</l>
<l>He left this Man to guard the <mentioned>Roman</mentioned> Frontiers.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> You seem to know him well.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> Too well. I saw him in <mentioned>Cilicia</mentioned> first,</l>
<l>When <name>Cleopatra</name> there met <name>Antony:</name></l>
<l>A mortal he was to us, and <mentioned>&AElig;gypt.</mentioned></l>
<l>But, let me witness to the worth I hate,</l>
<l>A braver Roman never drew a Sword.</l>
<l>Firm to his Prince; but, as a friend, not slave.</l>
<l>He ne'r was of his pleasures; but presides</l>
<l>O're all his cooler hours and morning counsels:</l>
<l>In short, the plainness, fierceness, rugged virtue</l>
<l>Of an old true-stampt Roman lives in him.</l>
<l>His coming bodes I know not what of ill</l>
<l>To our affairs. Withdraw, to mark him better;</l>
<l>And I'll acquaint you why I sought you here,
<pb n="415"/></l>
<l>And what's our present work.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ventidius.</speaker><l> Not see him, say you?</l>
<l>I say, I must, and will.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gent.</speaker><l> He has commanded,
<stage>They withdraw to a corner of the Stage; 
and Ventidius, 
with the other, comes forwards to the front.</stage></l>
<l>On pain of death, none should approach his presence.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> I bring him news will raise his drooping Spirits,</l>
<l>Give him new life.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gent.</speaker><l> He sees not <name>Cleopatra.</name></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> Would he had never seen her.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gent.</speaker><l> He eats not, drinks not, sleeps not, has no use</l>
<l>Of any thing, but thought; or, if he talks,</l>
<l>'Tis to himself, and then 'tis perfect raving:</l>
<l>Then he defies the World, and bids it pass;</l>
<l>Sometimes he gnawes his Lip, and Curses loud</l>
<l>The Boy Octavius: then he draws his mouth</l>
<l>Into a scornful smile, and cries, Take all,</l>
<l>The World's not worth my care.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> Just, just his nature.</l>
<l>Virtues his path; but sometimes 'tis too narrow</l>
<l>For his vast Soul; and then he starts out wide,</l>
<l>And bounds into a Vice that bears him far</l>
<l>From his first course, and plunges him in ills:</l>
<l>But, when his danger makes him find his fault,</l>
<l>Quick to observe, and full of sharp remorse,</l>
<l>He censures eagerly his own misdeeds,</l>
<l>Judging himself with malice to himself,</l>
<l>And not forgiving what as Man he did,</l>
<l>Because his other parts are more than Man.</l>
<l>He must not thus be lost. <stage>[<name>Alexas</name> and the Priests come forward.</stage></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> You have your full Instructions, now advance;</l>
<l>Proclaim your Orders loudly.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> <mentioned>Romans, &AElig;gyptians,</mentioned> hear the Queen's Command.</l>
<l>Thus <name>Cleopatra</name> bids, Let Labor cease,</l>
<l>To Pomp and Triumphs give this happy day,</l>
<l>That gave the World a Lord: 'tis <name>Antony's.</name></l>
<l>Live, <name>Antony;</name> and <name>Cleopatra</name> live.</l>
<l>Be this the general voice sent up to Heav'n.</l>
<l>And every publick place repeat this eccho.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> <stage>aside.</stage> Fine Pageantry!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> Set out before your doors</l>
<l>The Images of all your sleeping Fathers,</l>
<l>With Laurels crown'd; with Laurels wreath your posts,</l>
<l>And strow with Flow'rs the Pavement; Let the Priests</l>
<l>Do present Sacrifice; pour out the Wine,</l>
<l>And call the Gods to joyn with you in gladness.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> Curse on the tongue that bids this general joy.</l>
<l>Can they be friends of <name>Antony,</name> who Revel</l>
<l>When <name>Antony'</name>s in danger? Hide, for shame,</l>
<l>You <mentioned>Romans,</mentioned> your Great grandsires Images,
<pb n="416"/></l>
<l>For fear their Souls should animate their Marbles,</l>
<l>To blush at their degenerate Progeny.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> A love which knows no bounds to <name>Antony,</name></l>
<l>Would mark the Day with honors; when all Heaven</l>

<sp><speaker>Cleo.</speaker><l> I have none.</l>
<l>And none would have: my Love's a noble madness,</l>

<l>But I have lov'd with such transcendent passion,</l>
<l>I soard, at first, quite out of Reasons view,</l>

<l>'Tis thus: would <name>Antony</name> could see me now;</l>
<l>Think you he would not sigh? though he must leave me,</l>
<l>Sure he would sigh; for he is noble-natur'd,</l>
<l>And bears a tender heart: I know him well.</l>
<l>Ah, no, I know him not; I knew him once,</l>

<sp><speaker>Iras.</speaker><l> I know he loves you.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleo.</speaker><l> Had he been kind, her eyes had told me so,</l>

<l>Just as he sent it, <name>Charmion,</name> undisguis'd,</l>
<l>And in the words he spoke.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Char.</speaker><l> I found him then</l>
<l>Incompass'd round, I think, with Iron Statues,</l>
<l>So mute, so motionless his Soldiers stood,</l>
<l>While awfully he cast his eyes about,</l>

<l>I numbred in it all your sighs and tears,</l>
<l>And while I mov'd your pitiful request,</l>
<l>That you but only beg'd a last farewel,</l>
<l>He fetch'd an inward groan, and ev'ry time</l>
<l>I nam'd you, sigh'd, as if his heart were breaking,</l>
<l>But shun'd my eyes, and guiltily look'd down;</l>
<l>He seem'd not now that awful <name>Antony</name></l>
<l>Who shook an Arm'd Assembly with his Nod,</l>
<l>But making show as he would rub his eyes,</l>
<l>Disguis'd and blotted out a falling tear.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Did he then weep? and, Was I worth a tear?</l>
<l>If what thou hast to say be not as pleasing,</l>
<l>Tell me no more, but let me dye contented.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Char.</speaker><l> He bid me say, He knew himself so well,</l>
<l>He could deny you nothing, if he saw you;</l>
<l>And therefore&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Thou would'st say, he wou'd not see me?</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> You misjudge;</l>
<l>You see through Love, and that deludes your sight:</l>
<l>As, what is strait, seems crooked through the Water;</l>
<l>But I, who bear my reason undisturb'd,</l>
<l>Can see this <name>Antony,</name> this dreaded Man,</l>
<l>A fearful slave, who fain would run away,</l>
<l>And shuns his Master's eyes: if you pursue him,</l>

<sp><speaker>Cleo.</speaker><l> He sends word</l>
<l>He fears to see my face.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> And would you more?</l>

<l>To think I sought this parting, or desir'd</l>
<l>To accuse you more than what will clear my self,</l>
<l>And justifie this breach.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleo.</speaker><l> Thus low I thank you.</l>

<l>(And therein you are kind) that <name>C&aelig;sar</name> first
<pb n="432"/></l>
<l>Enjoy'd my love, though you deserv'd it better:</l>
<l>I grieve for that, my Lord, much more than you;</l>
<l>For, had I first been yours, it would have sav'd</l>
<l>My second choice: I never had been his,</l>
<l>And ne'r had been but yours. But <name>C&aelig;sar</name> first,</l>
<l>You say, possess'd my love. Not so, my Lord:</l>
<l>He first possess'd my Person; you my Love:</l>
<l><name>C&aelig;sar</name> lov'd me; but I lov'd <name>Antony.</name></l>
<l>If I endur'd him after, 'twas because</l>
<l>I judg'd it due to the first name of Men;</l>
<l>And, half constrain'd, I gave, as to a Tyrant,</l>
<l>What he would take by force.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> O Syren! Syren!</l>
<l>Yet grant that all the love she boasts were true,</l>
<l>Has she not ruin'd you? I still urge that,</l>
<l>The fatal consequence.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleo.</speaker><l> The consequence indeed,</l>

<l>(Such <name>Fulvia</name> was)</l>
<l>Yes, but he'll say, you left <name>Octavia</name> for me;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l>

<l>Which quitted such desert, for worthless me?</l>
<l>How often have I wish'd some other <name>C&aelig;sar,</name></l>
<l>Great as the first, and as the second young,</l>
<l>Would court my Love to be refus'd for you!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> Words, words; but <mentioned>Actium,</mentioned> Sir, remember <mentioned>Actium.</mentioned></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleo.</speaker><l> Ev'n there, I dare his malice. True, I Counsel'd</l>

<l>I fled; but not to the Enemy. 'Twas fear;</l>
<l>Would I had been a Man, not to have fear'd,</l>

<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> We're both unhappy:</l>

<l>See, see, <name>Ventidius</name>! here he offers <mentioned>&AElig;gypt,</mentioned></l>

<l>You leave me, <name>Anthony</name>; and, yet I love you.</l>

<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Go! Whither? go from all that's excellent!</l>
<l>Faith, Honor, Virtue, all good things forbid,</l>
<l>That I should go from her, who sets my love</l>

<l>Give to your Boy, your <name>C&aelig;sar,</name></l>
<l>This Rattle of a Globe to play withal,</l>
<l>This Gu-gau World, and put him cheaply off:</l>

 on Cleopatra's. Charmion and Iras hold a Laurel Wreath betwixt
them. A Dance of &AElig;gyptians. After the Ceremony, Cleopatra Crowns Antony.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> I Thought how those white arms would fold me in,</l>

<l>Let <name>C&aelig;sar</name> spread his subtile Nets, like Vulcan,</l>
<l>In thy embraces I would be beheld</l>
<l>By Heav'n and Earth at once:</l>

<l>Let those who took us blush; I would love on</l>
<l>With awful State, regardless of their frowns,</l>
<l>As their superior god.</l>
<l>There's no satiety of Love, in thee;</l>
<l>Enjoy'd, thou still art new; perpetual Spring</l>

<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> O, now the danger's past, your General comes.</l>
<l>He joyns not in your joys, nor minds your Triumphs;</l>
<l>But, with contracted brows, looks frowning on,</l>

<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> I'm waning in his favor, yet I love him;</l>

<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> We can conquer.</l>
<l>You see, without your aid.</l>
<l>We have dislodg'd their Troops,</l>

<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> Have you no friend</l>
<l>In all his Army, who has power to move him,</l>
<l><name>Mec&aelig;nas,</name> or <name>Agrippa</name> might do much.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Thank thy love.</l>
<l>Some four or five such Victories as this,</l>
<l>Will save thy farther pains.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> Expect no more; <name>C&aelig;sar</name> is on his Guard:</l>
<l>I know, Sir, you have conquer'd against ods;</l>
<l>But still you draw Supplies from one poor Town,</l>

<l>Yet I had one, the bravest youth of <mentioned>Rome,</mentioned></l>
<l>Whom <name>C&aelig;sar</name> loves beyond the love of Women;</l>
<l>He could resolve his mind, as Fire does Wax,</l>
<l>From that hard rugged Image, melt him down,</l>
<l>And mould him in what softer form he pleas'd.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> Him would I see; that man of all the world:</l>
<l>Just such a one we want.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> He lov'd me too,</l>
<l>I was his Soul; he liv'd not but in me:</l>
<l>We were so clos'd within each others brests,</l>
<l>The rivets were not found that join'd us first</l>
<l>That does not reach us yet: we were so mixt,</l>
<l>As meeting streams, both to our selves were lost;</l>
<l>We were one mass; we could not give or take,</l>
<l>But from the same; for he was I, I he.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> No matter where,</l>
<l>Since he's no longer mine. He took unkindly</l>
<l>That I forbade him <name>Cleopatra'</name>s sight;</l>
<l>Because I fear'd he lov'd her: he confest</l>
<l>He had a warmth, which, for my sake, he stifled;</l>
<l>For 'twere impossible that two, so one,</l>
<l>Should not have lov'd the same. When he departed,</l>
<l>He took no leave; and that confirm'd my thoughts.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> It argues that he lov'd you more than her,</l>
<l>Else he had staid; but he perceiv'd you jealous,</l>
<l>And would not grieve his friend: I know he loves you.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> I should have seen him then ere now.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> Perhaps</l>
<l>He has thus long been lab'ring for your peace.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Would he were here.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> Would you believe he lov'd you?</l>
<l>I read your answer in your eyes; you would.</l>
<l>Not to conceal it longer, he has sent</l>

<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Let him appear. <stage>[Exit Ventidius, and Re-enters immediately with Dollabella.</stage></l></sp>

<l>Art thou return'd at last, my better half? </l>
<l>Come, give me all my self.</l>
<l>Let me not live,</l>

<l>Was ever half so fond.</l></sp>

<l>Like a long-absent man, and wanders o'er</l>
<l>Each room, a stranger to her own, to look</l>
<l>If all be safe.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Thou hast what's left of me.</l>
<l>For I am now so sunk from what I was,</l>
<l>Thou find'st me at my lowest water-mark.</l>
<l>The Rivers that ran in, and rais'd my fortunes,</l>
<l>Are all dry'd up, or take another course:</l>
<l>What I have left is from my native Spring;</l>
<l>I've still a heart that swells, in scorn of fate,</l>
<l>And lifts me to my banks.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Still you are Lord of all the World to me.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Why, then I yet am so; for thou art all.</l>
<l>If I had any joy when thou wert absent,</l>
<l>I grudg'd it to my self; methought I robb'd</l>
<l>Thee of thy part. But, Oh my <name>Dollabella!</name></l>
<l>Thou hast beheld me other than I am.</l>

<pb n="438"/></l>
<l>With Scepter'd Slaves, who waited to salute me:</l>
<l>With Eastern Monarchs, who forgot the Sun,</l>
<l>To worship my uprising? Menial Kings</l>
<l>Ran coursing up and down my Palace-yard,</l>
<l>Stood silent in my presence, watch'd my eyes,</l>
<l>And, at my least command, all started out</l>
<l>Like Racers to the Goal.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Slaves to your fortune.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Yes, when his end is so, I must join with him;</l>
<l>Indeed I must, and yet you must not chide:</l>
<l>Why am I else your friend?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Take heed, young man,</l>
<l>How thou upbraid'st my love: the Queen has eyes,</l>

<l>The Gentle Winds were lodg'd in Purple sails:</l>

<l>Where she, another Sea-born <name>Venus,</name> lay.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> No more: I would not hear it.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> O, you must!</l>
<l>She lay, and leant her cheek upon her hand,</l>
<l>And cast a look so languishingly sweet,</l>
<l>As if, secure of all beholders hearts,</l>
<l>Neglecting she could take 'em: Boys, like <name>Cupids,</name></l>
<l>Stood fanning, with their painted wings, the winds</l>
<l>That plaid about her face: but if she smil'd,</l>
<l>A darting glory seem'd to blaze abroad:</l>
<l>That mens desiring eyes were never weary'd;</l>
<l>But hung upon the object: to soft Flutes</l>
<l>The Silver Oars kept time; and while they plaid,</l>
<l>The hearing gave new pleasure to the sight;</l>
<l>And both to thought: 'twas Heav'n, or somewhat more;</l>
<l>For she so charm'd all hearts, that gazing crowds</l>
<l>Stood panting on the shore, and wanted breath</l>
<l>To give their welcome voice.</l>
<l>Then, <name>Dollabella,</name> where was then thy Soul?</l>
<l>Was not thy fury quite disarm'd with wonder?</l>

<l>That I accus'd her of my Brothers death?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> And should my weakness be a plea for yours?</l>

<l>Yours, he would say, in your declining age,</l>
<l>When no more heat was left but what you forc'd,</l>
<l>When all the sap was needful for the Trunk,</l>
<l>When it went down, then you constrain'd the course,</l>
<l>And robb'd from Nature, to supply desire;</l>
<l>In you (I would not use so harsh a word)</l>
<l>But 'tis plain dotage.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Ha!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> 'Twas urg'd too home.</l>
<l>But yet the loss was private that I made;</l>
<l>'Twas but my self I lost: I lost no Legions;</l>

<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> I bring Conditions from him.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Are they Noble?</l>
<l>Methinks thou shouldst not bring 'em else; yet he</l>
<l>Is full of deep dissembling; knows no Honour,</l>
<l>Divided from his Int'rest. Fate mistook him;</l>
<l>For Nature meant him for an Usurer,</l>

<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> It was my <name>Dollabella,</name> or some God.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Nor I; nor yet <name>Mec&aelig;nas,</name> nor <name>Agrippa:</name></l>
<l>They were your Enemies; and I a Friend</l>

<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> When I forget it,</l>
<l>Be thou unkind, and that's my greatest curse.</l>
<l>My Queen shall thank him too.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> I fear she will not.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> I would not see her lost.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> When I forsake her,</l>
<l>Leave me, my better Stars; for she has truth</l>
<l>Beyond her beauty. <name>C&aelig;sar</name> tempted her,</l>

<l>Look on her, view her well; and those she brings:</l>
<l>Are they all strangers to your eyes? has Nature</l>
<l>No secret call, no whisper they are yours?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> For shame, my Lord, if not for love, receive 'em</l>
<l>With kinder eyes. If you confess a man,</l>
<l>Meet 'em, embrace 'em, bid 'em welcome to you.</l>
<l>Your arms should open, ev'n without your knowledge,</l>
<l>To clasp 'em in; your feet should turn to wings,</l>
<l>To bear you to 'em; and your eyes dart out,</l>
<l>And aim a kiss ere you could reach the lips.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> I stood amaz'd to think how they came hither</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Octav.</speaker><l> Thus long I have attended for my welcome;</l>
<l>Which, as a stranger, sure I might expect.</l>
<l>Who am I?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> <name>C&aelig;sar'</name>s Sister.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Octav.</speaker><l> That's unkind!</l>
<l>Had I been nothing more than <name>C&aelig;sar'</name>s Sister,</l>

<l>'Tis true, I have a heart disdains your coldness,</l>

<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> Do, take it, thou deserv'st it.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> On my Soul,</l>

<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> I fear, <name>Octavia,</name> you have begg'd my life.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Octav.</speaker><l> Begg'd it, my Lord?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Yes, begg'd it, my Ambassadress,</l>

<sp><speaker>Octav.</speaker><l> Poorly and basely I could never beg;</l>

<l>A Man, my Equal, in the place of <name>Jove,</name></l>
<l>As he could give me being? No; that word,</l>

<l>And die upon my tongue.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> You shall not need it.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> I will not need it. Come, you've all betray'd me:</l>
<l>My Friend too! To receive some vile conditions.</l>
<l>My Wife has bought me, with her prayers and tears;</l>
<l>And now I must become her branded Slave:</l>
<l>In every peevish mood she will upbraid</l>
<l>The life she gave: if I but look awry,</l>
<l>She cries, I'll tell my Brother.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Octav.</speaker><l> My hard fortune</l>
<l>Subjects me still to your unkind mistakes.</l>

<l>Sir, you are free; free, ev'n from her you loath;</l>
<l>For, tho' my Brother bargains for your love,</l>
<l>Makes me the price and cement of your peace,</l>
<l>I have a Soul like yours; I cannot take</l>

<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> <name>Octavia,</name> I have heard you, and must praise</l>
<l>The greatness of your Soul;</l>
<l>But cannot yield to what you have propos'd:</l>

<l>And you do all for duty. You would free me,</l>
<l>And would be dropt at <mentioned>Athens;</mentioned> was't not so?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Octav.</speaker><l> It was, my Lord.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Then I must be oblig'd</l>
<l>To one who loves me not, who, to her self,</l>
<l>May call me thankless and ungrateful Man:</l>

<l>That you might think you ow'd me for your life,</l>
<l>And ow'd it to my duty, not my love.</l>
<l>I have been injur'd, and my haughty Soul</l>
<l>Could brook but ill the Man who slights my Bed.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Therefore you love me not.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Octav.</speaker><l> Therefore, my Lord,</l>
<l>I should not love you.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Therefore you wou'd leave me?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Octav.</speaker><l> And therefore I should leave you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;if I could.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Her Souls too great, after such injuries,</l>
<l>To say she loves; and yet she lets you see it.</l>
<l>Her modesty and silence plead her cause.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> O, <name>Dollabella,</name> which way shall I turn?</l>
<l>I find a secret yielding in my Soul;</l>
<l>But <name>Cleopatra,</name> who would die with me,</l>

<l>But does it not plead more for <name>Cleopatra?</name></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> Justice and Pity both plead for <name>Octavia;</name></l>

<l>Come, come, my Lord, if I can pardon you,</l>
<l>Methinks you should accept it. Look on these;</l>

<l>As they are mine? Go to him, Children, go;</l>

<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Men are but Children of a larger growth,</l>
<l>Our appetites as apt to change as theirs,</l>
<l>And full as craving too, and full as vain;</l>
<l>And yet the Soul, shut up in her dark room,</l>
<l>Viewing so clear abroad, at home sees nothing;</l>
<l>But, like a Mole in Earth, busie and blind,</l>
<l>Works all her folly up, and casts it outward</l>
<l>To the Worlds open view: thus I discover'd,</l>
<l>And blam'd the love of ruin'd <name>Antony</name>;</l>
<l>Yet wish that I were he, to be so ruin'd.
<stage>Enter Ventidius above.</stage></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> Alone? and talking to himself? concern'd too?</l>
<l>Perhaps my ghess is right: he lov'd her once,</l>
<l>And may pursue it still.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> O Friendship! Friendship!</l>
<l>Ill canst thou answer this; and Reason, worse:</l>
<l>Unfaithful in th' attempt; hopeless to win;</l>
<l>And, if I win, undone: meer madness all.</l>
<l>And yet th' occasion's fair. What injury</l>
<l>To him, to wear the Robe which he throws by?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> None, none at all. This happens as I wish,</l>
<l>To ruine her yet more with <name>Antony.</name>
<stage>Enter Cleopatra, talking with Alexas, Charmion, Iras on the other side.</stage></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> She comes! What charms have sorrow on that face!</l>
<l>Sorrow seems pleas'd to dwell with so much sweetness;</l>
<l>Yet, now and then, a melancholy smile</l>
<l>Breaks loose, like Lightning, in a Winter's night,</l>
<l>And shows a moments day.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ven.</speaker><l> If she should love him too! Her Eunuch there!</l>
<l>That <mentioned>Porcpisce</mentioned> bodes ill weather. Draw, draw nearer,</l>
<l>Sweet Devil, that I may hear. <stage>[Dollabella goes over to Charmion and seems to talk with them.</stage></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> Believe me; try Iras;</l>
<l>To make him jealous; jealousie is like</l>
<l>A polisht Glass held to the lips when life's in doubt:</l>
<l>If there be breath, 'twill catch the damp and show it.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> I grant you jealousie's a proof of love,
<pb n="448"/></l>
<l>But 'tis a weak and unavailing Med'cine;</l>
<l>It puts out the disease, and makes it show,</l>
<l>But has no pow'r to cure.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> 'Tis your last remedy, and strongest too:</l>
<l>And then this <name>Dollabella,</name> who so fit</l>
<l>To practice on? He's handsom, valiant, young,</l>
<l>And looks as he were laid for Nature's bait</l>
<l>To catch weak Womens eyes.</l>
<l>He stands already more than half suspected</l>
<l>Of loving you: the least kind word, or glance,</l>
<l>You give this Youth, will kindle him with love:</l>
<l>Then, like a burning Vessel set adrift,</l>
<l>You'll send him down amain before the wind,</l>
<l>To fire the heart of jealous <name>Antony.</name></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Can I do this? Ah no; my love's so true,</l>
<l>That I can neither hide it where it is,</l>
<l>Nor show it where it is not. Nature meant me</l>
<l>A Wife, a silly harmless household Dove,</l>
<l>Fond without art; and kind without deceit;</l>
<l>But Fortune, that has made a Mistress of me,</l>
<l>Hast thrust me out to the wide World, unfurnish'd</l>
<l>Of falshood to be happy.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> Force your self.</l>
<l>Th' event will be, your Lover will return</l>
<l>Doubly desirous to possess the good</l>
<l>Which once he fear'd to lose.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> I must attempt it;</l>
<l>But Oh with what regret! <stage>Exit Alex.</stage> <stage>[She comes up to Dollabella.</stage></l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> How; and how?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Iras.</speaker><l> Such praises of your beauty!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Meer Poetry.</l>

<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Those <mentioned>Roman</mentioned> Wits have never been in <mentioned>Egypt,</mentioned></l>

<l>I, who have seen&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;had I been born a Poet,</l>
<l>Should chuse a nobler name.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> You flatter me.</l>
<l>But, 'tis your Nation's vice: all of your Country</l>
<l>Are flatterers, and all false. Your Friend's like you.</l>
<l>I'm sure he sent you not to speak these words.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> No, Madam; yet he sent me&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Well, he sent you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Of a less pleasing errand.

<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> How less pleasing?</l>
<l>Less to your self, or me?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Madam, to both;</l>
<l>For you must mourn, and I must grieve to cause it.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> You, <name>Charmion,</name> and your Fellow, stand at distance.
<stage>(Aside.)</stage></l><l>Hold up, my Spirits.&mdash;&mdash;Well, now your mournful matter;</l>
<l>For I'm prepar'd, perhaps can ghess it too.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> I wish you would; for 'tis a thankless office</l>
<l>To tell ill news: and I, of all your Sex,</l>
<l>Most fear displeasing you.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Of all your Sex,</l>
<l>I soonest could forgive you, if you should.</l></sp>

<l>Dear damn'd, inconstant Sex!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> In the first place,</l>
<l>I am to be forsaken; is't not so?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> I wish I could not answer to that question.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Then pass it o'er, because it troubles you:</l>
<l>I should have been more griev'd another time.</l>
<l>Next, I'm to lose my Kingdom.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Farewel, <mentioned>Egypt.</mentioned></l>
<l>Yet, is there any more?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Madam, I fear</l>
<l>Your too deep sense of grief has turn'd your reason.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> No, no, I'm not run mad; I can bear Fortune:</l>
<l>And Love may be expell'd by other Love,</l>
<l>As Poysons are by Poysons.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> &mdash;&mdash;You o'erjoy me, Madam,</l>
<l>To find your griefs so moderately born.</l>
<l>You've heard the worst; all are not false, like him.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> No; Heav'n forbid they should.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Some men are constant.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> And constancy deserves reward, that's certain.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Deserves it not; but give it leave to hope.</l></sp>

<l>To mollifie that rugged word <mentioned>Depart.</mentioned></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Oh, you mistake: he chose the harshest words,</l>
<l>With fiery eyes, and with contracted brows,</l>
<l>He coyn'd his face in the severest stamp:</l>
<l>And fury shook his Fabrick like an Earthquake;</l>
<l>He heav'd for vent, and burst like bellowing <mentioned>&AElig;tna,</mentioned></l>
<l>In sounds scarce humane, &lsquo;Hence, away for ever:</l>
<l>&lsquo;Let her begone, the blot of my renown, 

<stage>[All the time of this speech, Cleop. seems more and more concern'd, till she sinks quite down.</stage>
</l>
<l>&lsquo;And bane of all my hopes: </l>
<l>&lsquo;Let her be driv'n as far as men can think </l>
<l>&lsquo;From Mans commerce: She'll poyson to the Center.&rsquo;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Oh, I can bear no more!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Help, help: Oh Wretch! Oh cursed, cursed Wretch!</l>

<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Oh, let him not approach me.</l>
<l>Why have you brought me back to this loath'd Being,</l>
<l>Th' abode of Falshood, violated Vows,</l>
<l>And injur'd Love? For pity, let me go;</l>
<l>For, if there be a place of long repose,</l>
<l>I'm sure I want it. My disdainful Lord</l>
<l>Can never break that quiet; nor awake</l>
<l>The sleeping Soul, with hollowing in my Tomb</l>
<l>Such words as fright her hence. Unkind, unkind.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> <stage>kneeling.</stage> Believe me, 'tis against my self I speak,</l>
<l>That sure deserves belief; I injur'd him:</l>
<l>My Friend ne'er spoke those words. Oh, had you seen</l>
<l>How often he came back, and every time</l>
<l>With something more obliging and more kind,</l>
<l>To add to what he said; what dear Farewels;</l>
<l>How almost vanquisht by his love he parted,</l>
<l>And lean'd to what unwillingly he left:</l>
<l>I, Traitor as I was, for love of you,</l>
<l>(But what can you not do, who made me false!)</l>
<l>I forg'd that lye; for whose forgiveness kneels</l>
<l>This self-accused, self-punished Criminal.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> With how much ease believe we what we wish!</l>
<l>Rise, <name>Dollabella</name>; if you have been guilty,</l>
<l>I have contributed, and too much love</l>
<l>Has made me guilty too.</l>
<l>Th' advance of kindness which I made, was feigned,</l>
<l>To call back fleeting love by jealousie;</l>
<l>But 'twould not last. Oh, rather let me lose</l>
<l>Than so ignobly trifle with his heart.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> I find your breast fenc'd round from humane reach,</l>
<l>Transparent as a Rock of solid Crystal;
<pb n="451"/></l>
<l>Seen through, but never pierc'd. My Friend, my Friend!</l>
<l>What endless treasure hast thou thrown away,</l>

<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> I said at first I was not fit to go;</l>
<l>I could not hear her sighs, and see her tears,</l>
<l>But pity must prevail: and so, perhaps,</l>

<l>Draw near, you well-join'd wickedness, you Serpents,</l>
<l>Whom I have, in my kindly bosom, warm'd</l>

<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> My Lord, have I</l>

<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Can Heav'n prepare</l>
<l>A newer Torment? Can it find a Curse</l>
<l>Beyond our separation?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Yes, if Fate</l>
<l>Be just, much greater; Heav'n should be ingenious</l>
<l>In punishing such crimes. The rowling Stone,</l>
<l>And gnawing Vulture, were slight pains, invented</l>
<l>When <name>Jove</name> was young, and no examples known</l>
<l>Of mighty ills; but you have ripen'd sin</l>

<l>In Dowry with my heart; I had no use,</l>
<l>No fruit of all, but you: a Friend and Mistress</l>
<l>Was what the World could give. Oh, <name>Cleopatra</name>!</l>
<l>Oh, <name>Dollabella</name>! how could you betray</l>
<l>This tender heart, which with an Infant-fondness</l>
<l>Lay lull'd betwixt your bosoms, and there slept

<l>Secure of injur'd Faith?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> If she has wrong'd you,</l>
<l>Heav'n, Hell, and You revenge it.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> If she wrong'd me,</l>
<l>Thou wouldst evade thy part of guilt; but swear</l>
<l>Thou lov'st not her.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Not so as I love you.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Not so! Swear, swear, I say, thou dost not love her.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> No more than Friendship will allow.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> No more?</l>
<l>Friendship allows thee nothing: thou art perjur'd.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l>
<l>And yet thou didst not swear thou lov'dst her not;</l>
<l>But not so much, no more. Oh trifling Hypocrite,</l>
<l>Who dar'st not own to her thou dost not love,</l>
<l>Nor own to me thou dost! <name>Ventidius</name> heard it;</l>
<l><name>Octavia</name> saw it.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> They are enemies.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> <name>Alexas</name> is not so; he, he confest it;</l>
<l>He, who, next Hell, best knew it, he avow'd it.
<stage>(To Dol.)</stage> </l><l>Why do I seek a proof beyond your self?</l>
<l>You whom I sent to bear my last Farewel,</l>
<l>Return'd to plead her stay.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> What shall I answer?</l>
<l>If to have lov'd be guilt, then I have sinn'd;</l>
<l>But if to have repented of that love</l>
<l>Can wash away my crime, I have repented.</l>
<l>Yet, if I have offended past forgiveness,</l>
<l>Let not her suffer: she is innocent.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Ah, what will not a Woman do who loves!</l>
<l>What means will she refuse, to keep that heart</l>
<l>Where all her joys are plac'd! 'Twas I encourag'd,</l>
<l>'Twas I blew up the fire that scorch'd his Soul,</l>
<l>To make you jealous; and by that regain you.</l>
<l>But all in vain; I could not counterfeit:</l>
<l>In spight of all the damms, my love broke o'er,</l>
<l>And drown'd my heart again: Fate took th' occasion;</l>
<l>And thus one minutes feigning has destroy'd</l>
<l>My whole life's truth.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Thin Cobweb Arts of Falshood;</l>
<l>Seen, and broke through at first.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Forgive your Mistress.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Forgive your Friend.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> You have convinc'd your selves,</l>
<l>You plead each others Cause: What Witness have you,</l>
<l>That you but meant to raise my jealousie?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Our selves, and Heav'n.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Guilt witnesses for guilt. Hence, Love and Friendship;</l>
<l>You have no longer place in humane breasts,</l>
<l>These two have driv'n you out: avoid my sight;
<pb n="459"/></l>
<l>I would not kill the Man whom I lov'd;</l>
<l>And cannot hurt the Woman; but avoid me,</l>
<l>I do not know how long I can be tame;</l>
<l>For, if I stay one minute more to think</l>
<l>How I am wrong'd, my Justice and Revenge</l>
<l>Will cry so loud within me, that my pity</l>
<l>Will not be heard for either.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolla.</speaker><l> Heav'n has but</l>
<l>Our sorrow for our sins; and then delights</l>
<l>To pardon erring Man: sweet Mercy seems</l>
<l>Its darling Attribute, which limits Justice;</l>
<l>As if there were degrees in Infinite;</l>
<l>And Infinite would rather want perfection</l>
<l>Than punish to extent.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> I can forgive</l>
<l>A Foe; but not a Mistress, and a Friend:</l>
<l>Treason is there in its most horrid shape,</l>
<l>Where truth is greatest: and the Soul resign'd</l>

<l>That I have lost for you: or to the <mentioned>Romans</mentioned>?</l>
<l>They hate me for your sake: or must I wander</l>

<l>Banish'd for love of you; banish'd from you;</l>
<l>I, there's the Banishment! Oh hear me; hear me,</l>

<l>I have a Fool within me takes your part;</l>

<l>'Twas then, false Fortune, like a fawning Strumpet,</l>
<l>About to leave the Bankrupt Prodigal,</l>
<l>With a dissembled smile wou'd kiss at parting,</l>
<l>And flatter to the last; the well-tim'd Oars</l>
<l>Now dipt from every bank, now smoothly run</l>
<l>To meet the Foe; and soon indeed they met,</l>
<l>But not as Foes. In few, we saw their Caps</l>

<sp><speaker>Serap.</speaker><l> His fury cannot be express'd by words:

<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Base fawning Wretch! wouldst thou betray him too?</l>

<l>He who began this mischief,</l>
<l>'Tis just he tempt the danger: let him clear you;</l>
<l>And, since he offer'd you his servile tongue,</l>
<l>To gain a poor precarious life from <name>C&aelig;sar,</name></l>
<l>Let him expose that fawning eloquence,</l>

<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Slave, thou deserv'st it.</l>
<l>Not that I fear my Lord, will I avoid him;</l>
<l>I know him noble: when he banish'd me,</l>
<l>And thought me false, he scorn'd to take my life;</l>
<l>But I'll be justifi'd, and then die with him.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alex.</speaker><l> O pity me, and let me follow you.</l></sp>

<l>I was but great for her; my Pow'r, my Empire,

<l>I care not which I take: I'm only troubled</l>
<l>The life I bear, is worn to such a rag,</l>
<l>'Tis scarce worth giving. I cou'd wish indeed</l>
<l>We threw it from us with a better grace;</l>

<p><cit><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="scott-1808"><name type="authority">Sir Walter Scott</name> (<hi rend="italic">Introduction to</hi> &lsquo;All for Love,&rsquo; Dryden's <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> V, 287,
London, 1808)</ref></bibl><quote><p> The first point of comparison [between Shakespeare's Play and
Dryden's] is the general conduct, or plot, of the tragedy. . . . Shakespeare, with the
license peculiar to his age and character, had diffused the action of his play over
Italy, Greece, and Egypt; but Dryden, who was well aware of the advantage to be
derived from a simplicity and concentration of plot, has laid every scene in the city
of Alexandria. By this he guarded the audience from that vague and puzzling distraction
 which must necessarily attend a violent change of place. It is a mistake to
suppose that the argument in favour of the unities depends upon preserving the
deception of the scene; they are necessarily connected with the intelligibility of the
piece. It may be true, that no spectator supposes that the stage before him is actually
 the court of Alexandria; yet, when he has once made up his mind to let it pass
as such during the representation, it is a cruel tax, not merely on his imagination,
but on his powers of comprehension, if the scene be suddenly transferred to a distant
 country. Time is lost before he can form new associations, and reconcile their
bearings with those originally presented to him, and if he be a person of slow comprehension,
 or happens to lose any part of the dialogue, announcing the changes, the
whole becomes unintelligible confusion. In this respect, and in discarding a number
 of uninteresting characters, the plan of Dryden's play must be unequivocally
preferred to that of Shakespeare in point of coherence, unity, and simplicity. It is
a natural consequence of this more artful arrangement of the story, that Dryden contents
 himself with the concluding scene of Antony's history, instead of introducing
the incidents of the war with Cneius Pompey, the negotiation with Lepidus, death
of his first wife, and other circumstances, which, in Shakespeare, only tend to distract
 our attention from the main interest of the drama. The unity of time, as
necessary as that of place to the intelligibility of the drama, has, in like manner,
been happily attained; and an interesting event is placed before the audience with
no other change of place, and no greater lapse of time, than can be readily adapted
to an ordinary imagination. But, having given Dryden the praise of superior address
in managing the story, I fear he must be pronounced in most other respects inferior
to his grand prototype. Antony, the principal character in both plays, is incomparably
 grander in that of Shakespeare. The majesty and generosity of the military
hero is happily expressed by both poets; but the awful ruin of grandeur, undermined
by passion, and tottering to its fall, is far more striking in the Antony of Shakespeare.
 Love, it is true, is the predominant, but it is not the sole ingredient in his
character. It has usurped possession of his mind, but is assailed by his original passions,
 ambition of power, and thirst for military fame. He is, therefore, often, and
it should seem naturally represented, as feeling for the downfall of his glory and
power, even so intensely as to withdraw his thoughts from Cleopatra, unless considered
 as the cause of his ruin. Thus, in the scene in which he compares himself
to &lsquo;black Vesper's pageants,&rsquo; he runs on in a train of fantastic and melancholy
similes, having relation only to his fallen state, till the mention of Egypt suddenly
recalls the idea of Cleopatra. But Dryden has taken a different view of Antony's
character, and more closely approaching to his title of <hi rend="italic">All for Love.</hi> &lsquo;He seems not
now that awful Antony.&rsquo; His whole thoughts and being are dedicated to his fatal
passion; and though a spark of resentment is occasionally struck out by the
reproaches of Ventidius, he instantly relapses into love-sick melancholy. The following 
<pb n="474"/>
beautiful speech exhibits the romance of despairing love, without the deep
and mingled passion of a dishonoured soldier, and dethroned emperor: [<hi rend="italic">All for
Love:</hi> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> Lie there, thou shadow of an Emperor. . . . And take me for their
&lsquo;fellow-citizen,&rsquo; p. 417.] Even when Antony is finally ruined, the power of jealousy
is called upon to complete his despair, and he is less sensible to the idea of C&aelig;sar's
successful arms than to the risque of Dolabella's rivalling him in the affections of
Cleopatra. It is true, the Antony of Shakespeare also starts into fury, upon Cleopatra 
permitting Thyreus to kiss her hand; but this is not jealousy; it is pride
offended, that she, for whom he had sacrificed his glory and empire, should already
begin to court the favour of the conqueror, and vouchsafe her hand to be saluted by
a &lsquo;jack of C&aelig;sar's.&rsquo; Hence Enobarbus, the witness of the scene, alludes immediately 
to the fury of mortified ambition and falling power: &lsquo;'Tis better playing with
&lsquo;a lion's whelp, Than with an old one dying.&rsquo; . . . Having, however, adopted an idea
of Antony's character, rather suitable to romance than to nature, or history, we must
not deny Dryden the praise of having exquisitely brought out the picture he intended
to draw. He has informed us, that this was the only play written to please himself;
and he has certainly exerted in it the full force of his incomparable genius. Antony
is throughout the piece what the author meant him to be: a victim to the omnipotence
of love, or rather to the infatuation of one engrossing passion.</p>
<p>In the Cleopatra of Dryden, there is greatly less spirit and originality than in
Shakespeare's. The preparation of the latter for death has a grandeur which puts to
shame the same scene in Dryden, and serves to support the interest during the whole
fifth act, although Antony has died in the conclusion of the fourth. No circumstance
can more highly evince the power of Shakespeare's genius, in spite of his irregularities; 
since the conclusion in Dryden, where both lovers die in the same scene, and
after a reconciliation, is infinitely more artful and better adapted to theatrical effect.
In the character of Ventidius, Dryden has filled up, with ability, the rude sketches,
which Shakespeare has thrown off in those of Sc&aelig;va [<mentioned>sic</mentioned>] and Eros. The rough
old Roman soldier is painted with great truth; and the quarrel betwixt him and
Antony, in the first act, is equal to any single scene that our author ever wrote,
excepting, perhaps, that betwixt Sebastian and Dorax; an opinion in which the
judgment of the critic coincides with that of the poet. It is a pity, as has often been
remarked, that this dialogue occurs so early in the play, since what follows is necessarily 
inferior in force. Dryden, while writing this scene, had unquestionably in
his recollection the quarrel betwixt Brutus and Cassius, which was justly so great a
favourite in his time, and to which he had referred as inimitable in his prologue to
<foreign>Aureng-Zebe.</foreign> The inferior characters are better supported in Dryden than in
Shakespeare. We have no low buffoonery in the former, such as disgraces Enobarbus, 
and is hardly redeemed by his affecting catastrophe. Even the Egyptian
Alexas acquires some respectability, from his patriotic attachment to the interests of
his country, and from his skill as a wily courtier. . . . The Octavia of Dryden is a
much more important personage than in the <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> of Shakespeare.
She is, however, more cold and unamiable; for, in the very short scenes in which
the Octavia of Shakespeare appears, she is placed in rather an interesting point of
view. But Dryden has himself informed us, that he was apprehensive the justice of
a wife's claim upon her husband would draw the audience to her side, and lessen
their interest in the lover and the mistress. He seems accordingly to have studiedly
lowered the character of the injured Octavia, who, in her conduct towards her husband, 
shews much duty and little love; and plainly intimates, that her rectitude of
<pb n="475"/>
conduct flows from a due regard to her own reputation, rather than from attachment
to Antony's person, or sympathy with him in his misfortunes. It happens, therefore, 
with Octavia, as with all other very good selfish kind of people; we think it
unnecessary to feel any thing for her, as she is obviously capable of taking very good
care of herself. I must not omit, that her scolding scene with Cleopatra, although
anxiously justified by the author in the preface, seems too coarse to be in character,
and is a glaring exception to the general good taste evinced throughout the rest of
the piece. . . . In judging betwixt these celebrated passages, [the descriptions by
Shakespeare and by Dryden of Cleopatra on the Cydnus] we feel almost afraid to
avow a preference of Dryden, founded partly upon the easy flow of the verse, which
seems to soften with the subject, but chiefly upon the beauty of the language and
imagery, which is flowery without diffusiveness, and rapturous without hyperbole. I
fear Shakespeare cannot be exculpated from the latter fault; yet I am sensible, it is
by sifting his beauties from his conceits that his imitator has been enabled to excel
him. It is impossible to bestow too much praise on the beautiful passages which
occur so frequently in <hi rend="italic">All for Love.</hi> I content myself with extracting the sublime
and terrific description of an omen presaging the downfall of Egypt. [&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Serap.</hi> Last
night, between the Hours of Twelve and One. . . . And so unfinish'd left the horrid
Scene.&rsquo; p. 412.]</p></quote></cit>

absolutely banished the latter from the stage. A French critic calls Great Britain
the island of Shakspeare's idolaters; yet so it happens, in this same island, that Dryden's 
<hi rend="italic">All for Love</hi> has been acted ten times oftener than Shakspeare's <hi rend="italic">Antony and

of a popular dramatic poet's pieces on the stage is not a proof of his popularity
having expired, or being even on the decline. The frequenters of the theatre demand
variety. Moli&egrave;re is as much as ever a favourite of France, yet the pieces of other
comic writers are oftener represented.</note> Dryden's Mark Antony is a weak voluptuary from first to last. Not a
sentence of manly virtue is ever uttered by him that seems to come from himself; and
whenever he expresses a moral feeling, it appears not to have grown up in his own
nature, but to have been planted there by the influence of his friend Ventidius, like a
flower in a child's garden, only to wither and take no root. Shakspeare's Antony
is a very different being. When he hears of the death of his first wife, Fulvia, his
exclamation &lsquo;There's a great spirit gone!&rsquo; and his reflections on his own enthralment 
by Cleopatra, mark the residue of a noble mind. A queen, a siren, a Shakspeare's 
Cleopatra alone could have entangled Mark Antony, whilst an ordinary
wanton could have enslaved Dryden's hero.</p></quote></cit>

Octavia as well as that of Cleopatra: he has presented us with a regular scolding match
between the rivals, in which they come sweeping up to each other from opposite sides
of the stage, with their respective trains, like two pea-hens in a passion. Shakspeare
would no more have brought his captivating, brilliant, but meretricious Cleopatra into
immediate comparison with the noble and chaste simplicity of Octavia, than a connoisseur 
in art would have placed Canova's Dansatrice, beautiful as it is, beside the
Athenian Melpomene, or the Vestal of the Capitol.</p></quote></cit>

three or four exceptions, superior to anything produced by his contemporaries. If his
Cleopatra is wretched, his Antony is powerfully sketched. The altercation between

which has taken possession of the Roman commander, and against the force of which
the loyalty of Ventidius struggles to no purpose. There are few things said and
fewer things done by Antony which remind us of the great general, of the dishonored
soldier, of the fallen master of half the world. He is little more than a sentimental
love-sick swain, while the Egyptian queen has lost nearly every one of the characteristics 
with which she has impressed the ages, and is exhibited to us as displaying the
behavior of a tender-hearted, affectionate, and wholly romantic school-girl. Scott,
who is at his worst in his comparison of this play with Shakespeare's, assures us
that its plan must be preferred to that of the latter's on the score of coherence, unity,
and simplicity; and, further, that as a consequence of the more artful arrangement
of the story, the unity of time, like that of place, so necessary to the intelligibility
of the drama, has been happily attained. It is the last assertion alone which concerns 
us here. How has this unity of time been attained? It has been preserved
by the studious suppression of all reference whatever to its passage. Events are
crowded into it which history is not alone in assuring the scholar did not happen in
the space assigned: common sense further assures everybody they could not possibly
so have happened. Numerous minor incidents, however important, are not necessary 
to be considered in the examination of the play. But in this one day Antony
goes out to fight a great battle. We only hear of it; there is no representation of it.
On his return he reports that five thousand of his foes have been slain. As battles
go in this world, the mere despatching of so large a number of men would encroach
heavily upon the time allotted. Further, at a later period in this one day, the Egyptian 
fleet sets out to attack the enemy. Instead of fighting the Romans it goes over
<pb n="477"/>
to them. Then follow the consequences of defeat and despair. This is the happy
attainment of the same old spurious unity of time, which cheats our understanding
at the cost of our attention. Yet, though marked by these and other defects, Dryden's 
play is, after its kind, an excellent one. There are in it passages of great
power, which will explain the favor with which it has been held by many. Had its
author been gifted with dramatic genius, as he was not, he would doubtless have
made it far more effective. But under the limitations imposed by the critical canons
he accepted, neither he nor any one else could have drawn the picture of life which
we find in the wonderful corresponding creation of the great poet of human nature.</quote></cit>

the first Act to the last. But the power of delighting is derived principally from the
frequent changes of the scene; for, except the feminine arts, some of which are too
low, which distinguish Cleopatra, no character is very strongly discriminated. Upton,
who did not easily miss what he desired to find, has discovered that the language of
Antony is, with great skill and learning, made pompous and superb, according to his
real practice. But I think his diction not distinguishable from that of others: the
most tumid speech in the play is that which C&aelig;sar makes to Octavia. The events,
of which the principal are described according to history, are produced without any

</bibl><quote><p> This is a very noble play. Though not in the first class of
Shakespear's productions, it stands next to them, and is, we think, the finest of his
Historical Plays, that is, of those in which he made poetry the organ of history, and
assumed a certain tone of character and sentiment, in conformity to known facts,
instead of trusting to his observations of general nature or to the unlimited indulgence
of his own fancy. What he has added to the history, is upon a par with it. His
genius was, as it were, a match for history as well as nature, and could grapple at
will with either. This play is full of that pervading comprehensive power by which
the poet could always make himself master of time and circumstances. It presents
a fine picture of Roman pride and Eastern magnificence: and in the struggle between
the two, the empire of the world seems suspended, &lsquo;like the swan's down-feather,
&lsquo;That stands upon the swell at full of tide, And neither way inclines.&rsquo; The characters 
breathe, move, and live. Shakespear does not stand reasoning on what his
characters would do or say, but at once <hi rend="italic">becomes</hi> them, and speaks and acts for them.
He does not present us with groups of stage-puppets or poetical machines making set
speeches on human life, and acting from a calculation of ostensible motives, but he
brings living men and women on the scene, who speak and act from real feelings,
according to the ebbs and flows of passion, without the least tincture of the pedantry
of logic or rhetoric. Nothing is made out by inference and analogy, by climax and
antithesis, but every thing takes place just as it would have done in reality, according
to the occasion.</p>

which he has combined an almost literal fidelity to history with an equally faithful
adherence to the truth of nature, and in which he superinduces the merit of skilful
dramatic management, it would be <hi rend="italic">Anthony and Cleopatra.</hi> In his portraiture of
Antony there is, perhaps, a flattered likeness of the original by Plutarch; but the
similitude loses little of its strength by Shakspeare's softening and keeping in the
shade his traits of cruelty. In Cleopatra, we can discern nothing materially different
from the vouched historical sorceress; she nevertheless has a more vivid meteoric
and versatile play of enchantment in Shakspeare's likeness of her, than in a dozen
of other poetical copies in which the artists took much greater liberties with historical
truth:&mdash;he paints her as if the gypsy herself had cast her spell over him, and given
her own witchcraft to his pencil. At the same time, playfully interesting to our fancy
as he makes this enchantress, he keeps us far from a vicious sympathy. The asp at
her bosom, that lulls its nurse asleep, has no poison for our morality. A single
glance at the devoted and dignified Octavia recalls our homage to virtue; but with
delicate skill he withholds the purer woman from prominent contact with the wanton
Queen, and does not, like Dryden, bring the two to a scolding match.</p></quote></cit>

pardon, when her indiscretion had effected his utter ruin: &lsquo;Fall not a tear, I say,&rsquo;
etc. III, xi, 78. The opinion entertained by the dramatic Antony of the worthlessness 
of Cleopatra, is a circumstance entirely of the poet's own creation. Antony
describes her as &lsquo;cunning past man's thought,&rsquo; and designates her in terms which,
to the mind of a lover, would naturally communicate feelings of unmingled disgust.
&lsquo;I found you as a morsel,&rsquo; etc. III, xiii, 142. He is fully alive to, and bitterly
laments the folly and degradation of his conduct; but his firmest resolves are feebly
opposed against the potent spell of his &lsquo;grave charm,&mdash;Whose eye beck'd forth his
&lsquo;wars, and call'd them home; Whose bosom was his crownet, his chief end.&rsquo; The opinions 
and actions of Shakespeare's Antony, therefore, are diametrically opposed to each
other; but there is no inconsistency in his conduct. The licentiousness of Cleopatra
is the link which binds her to the heart of Antony; dissolute and voluptuous himself,
her depravity is congenial to his nature; that which others would have revolted from,
is to him a spell. . . . But, what was grateful to his appetite did not command the
approbation of his judgement. History has alike recorded Antony's intellectual
ability and his corporeal frailty: a victim to the latter, enough of the former doubtless
survived to impress on his memory the deepest sense of his folly, the weakness and
the unworthiness of his infatuation. Shakespeare read the inmost thoughts of Antony;
he has given them an everlasting record.</p></quote></cit>

of Cleopatra. It has passages, where he lets his mind loose, and follows his fancy
and feeling freely; particularly, perhaps, in the end; and even the verse breaks
delightfully out of its trammels, as in the speech about the cloud. The subject of the
play, in fact, was likely often to lead to this looser and softer character; tenderness,
even weakness, is its business. It is historical; but it is chiefly the anecdote of history, 
not the dignity of it. <hi rend="italic">Plutarch's Lives,</hi> his only authority, is in fact but, in great
degree, a collection of anecdotes. But there was no occasion to read Plutarch, to
understand the part of Cleopatra. The tenderness of feeling, however, extends
itself to other parts than those of the lovers; at least it is most remarkable in the
death of Enobarbus&mdash;a part which, after the manner of Shakespeare, is made to throw
great light on the character of Antony himself, which he meant to elevate as much
as possible; notwithstanding his great weakness in all that concerns Cleopatra, and
unmistakable misconduct with regard to his wife. He represents him as, what he
certainly was not, a man of the most noble and high spirit, capable at times, notwithstanding 
the luxury he afterwards fell into, of a thoroughly soldier-like life, and full
of kind and generous feelings. He seems to delight in supposing the melancholy
meditations of a great and active character, when losing his power, and drawing to

for introducing so many short scenes, which serve no purpose but to let the auditor
know the news. They form a sort of back-ground to the picture, but they detain the
action. For poetry and character, there are few dramas superior; nor is there any
want of deep and grand pathos; but perhaps both Antony and Cleopatra are too
heroic to be pitied for weakness, and too viciously foolish to be admired for their
heroism. Seldom has unlawful love been rendered so interesting; but the interest,

Marlowe; and, strangest of all, Sextus Pompeius is William Herbert; and Menas,
Thomas Thorpe. It is not probable, that Miss Anne Hathaway ever dreamt of being
the sister of C&aelig;sar and the wife of a greater than C&aelig;sar; but was Shakspere himself
conscious of his own position in the world of poetry and thought? Certainly, this
play proves it; but this self-consciousness is not in the least degree necessarily connected 
with pride or vanity; it is the repose, the calm majesty of the Olympian Jove;
and when Antony acknowledges himself a Roman by a Roman valiantly vanquished,
it is the Shakspere of 1593 acknowledging the moral supremacy and greatness of him
of 1613. It may perhaps be advisable, and more satisfactory to the reader to point
out, how far the characters in the Sonnets and in the Play agree or tally one with
another. The two ladies readily answer for themselves&mdash;Cleopatra being, of course,
the lady with the raven black eyes; and Octavia, Mrs. W. Shakspere. Enobarbus
also, the personal friend and favourite officer of Antony, treacherous, repentant, and
forgiven, is easily recognized as Lord Southampton, who was in after-life &lsquo;a great
&lsquo;captain in the Spanish wars, and in the Low Countries.&rsquo; To conclude, Antony is
evidently not the Mark Antony of history, but the fully developed Shakspere of 1593
&mdash;an archangel ruined; Lord Southampton is clearly pointed at in Enobarbus; the
character of Marlowe is drawn with extraordinary accuracy; the Earl of Pembroke
is very distinctly marked; and the allusion to Thomas Thorpe a home-thrust. It is
impossible that Shakspere, in his fiftieth year, could, even offhand as a sketch, have
written these passages without a clear and definite object; and yet the two apparently
trifling and unmeaning conversations, the one with Menas, and the other about
Lepidus, might have been omitted, and the parts of Pompey and Lepidus might have
been dismissed in a few words, just like Fulvia, without injury to the body of the
work; and perhaps the play would then have been cast in a more classical mould,
less distasteful to French critics, and more worthy of a Daniel or a Pembroke's
Mother; but it would not have been a Reply to the tale in the Sonnets.</p></quote></cit>

and wonderful tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra.</hi> We have already witnessed the

and sporting as an equal with those of <hi rend="italic">Venus and Adonis.</hi> We have now to see him
identify himself with two mortals at the height of fortune, who, in a species of heroic
madness, had conceived themselves to be in the position of Divine Powers, exempt
<pb n="481"/>
from all laws except that of their own wills. This is the elevation at which Shakspere 
sustains his argument, and thus prevents it from becoming immoral, as it does
in the hands of Dryden, who paints his heroine and hero as mere human persons, of
great rank indeed, indulging in voluptuous and licentious habits. No notion of guilt
attaches to the conduct of Shakspere's <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> either in the poet's
opinion or their own. They absolutely transcend all relative conventions, all possible
forms of manners. They consciously acknowledge, and therefore transgress, no law.
They live in an ideal region, far above the reach of a moral code, and justify their
acts on the warranty of their own nature. They swear by and recognise no higher
power than themselves. That this is a false position there is no doubt; and the
poet, by the catastrophe of his tragedy shows it to have been such. But while the
divine revels last, the actors in them fully believe that they are the divinities whom
they would represent. Antony and Cleopatra surrender themselves without reserve
to the inspirations with which they are filled, and are no less in their own estimation
than the very deities of love. They suffer no vulgar criticism, no every-day cares, to
come near them, and hold themselves aloof from the customary and the common.
They sit on thrones outside the circle of the round globe, and repose on couches
which float in air-like clouds, and never touch the surface of the planet. . . . There
is a poetic valour as well as a personal one, and it required a brave poet to conceive
and execute such a design. With a happy audacity, Shakspere rises from the beginning 
to the height of his theme. The love of his heroic pair, they assume to be
boundless. To set a bourne to it, would require the discovery of a new heaven, new
earth. The manner in which Antony suffers the imperial Egyptian to overbear his
very manhood shows at any rate that his is without limits. No consideration or
interest, however solemn or serious, can prevent its extension.</p></quote></cit>

The fascination exercised by Cleopatra over Antony, and hardly less by Antony over
Cleopatra, is not so much that of the senses as of the sensuous imagination. A third
of the world is theirs. They have left youth behind with its slight, melodious raptures

become a reality, when the world is limited and positive, when life is urged to yield
up quickly its utmost treasures of delight. What may they not achieve of joy who

whom he loved and who so long was loth to leave him, is here, as in history, the
visible one man revealed who could grapple for a second with very Rome and seem
to throw it, more lightly than he could cope with Cleopatra. And not the Roman
Landor himself could see or make us see more clearly than has his fellow provincial
of Warwickshire that first imperial nephew of her great first paramour, who was to
his actual uncle even such a foil and counterfeit and perverse and prosperous parody
as the son of Hortense Beauharnais of Saint-Leu to the son of Letizia Buonaparte
of Ajaccio. For Shakespeare too, like Landor, had watched his &lsquo;sweet Octavius&rsquo;
smilingly and frowningly &lsquo;draw under nose the knuckle of forefinger&rsquo; as he looked
out upon the trail of innocent blood after the bright receding figure of his brave
young kinsman. The fair-faced false &lsquo;present God&rsquo; of his poetic parasites, the
smooth triumphant patron and preserver with the heart of ice and iron, smiles before
us to the very life. It is of no account now to remember that &lsquo;he at Philippi kept
&lsquo;His sword even like a dancer:&rsquo; for the sword of Antony that struck for him is in
the renegade hand of Dercetas.</p>

there can be little or no doubt, produced the play of <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar,</hi> and had seen in
the character of Antony, notwithstanding all its great elements, the fatal consequences
of a &lsquo;vicious mole of nature.&rsquo; Antony may have been in his mind when he wrote
this passage. Thomas De Quincey, in his volume on <hi rend="italic">The C&aelig;sars,</hi> credits Shakespeare 
with an insight into the grand possibilities of Antony's nature, which the
Romans themselves could not have had: &lsquo;Shakespeare,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;had a just conception 
of the original grandeur which lay beneath that wild tempestuous nature
presented by Antony to the eye of the undiscriminating world. It is to the honor
of Shakespeare that he should have been able to discern the true coloring of this
most original character under the smoke and tarnish of antiquity. It is no less to
the honor of the great triumvir, that a strength of coloring should survive in his
character, capable of baffling the wrongs and ravages of time. Neither is it to be
thought strange that a character should have been misunderstood and falsely appreciated 
for nearly two thousand years. It happens not uncommonly, especially
amongst an unimaginative people, like the Romans, that the characters of men are
ciphers and enigmas to their own age, and are first read and interpreted by a far
distant posterity. . . . Men like Mark Antony, with minds of chaotic composition&mdash;
light conflicting with darkness, proportions of colossal grandeur disfigured by
unsymmetrical arrangement, the angelic in close neighborhood with the brutal&mdash;are
first read in their true meaning by an age learned in the philosophy of the human
heart. Of this philosophy the Romans had, by the necessities of education and
domestic discipline, not less than by original constitution of mind, the very narrowest 
visual range. . . . Not man in his own peculiar nature, but man in his relations
to other men, was the station from which the Roman speculators took up their
philosophy of human nature. Tried by such standard, Mark Antony would be
found wanting. As a citizen, he was irretrievably licentious, and therefore there
needed not the bitter personal feud, which circumstances had generated between
them, to account for the <hi rend="italic">acharnement</hi> with which Cicero pursued him. Had Antony
been his friend even, or his near kinsman, Cicero must still have been his public
enemy. And not merely for his vices; for even the grander features of his character, 
his towering ambition, his magnanimity, and the fascinations of his popular
qualities,&mdash;were all, in the circumstances of those times, and in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> disposition, of a
tendency dangerously uncivic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(Page 265): In such a highly-coloured and richly-sensuous passage [as the

<hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> that the problem consisted in shutting off sympathy with moral obliquity,
and inviting sympathy with moral freedom so far as the latter is asserted, on the part
of the principal actors. And just this, it will be seen, Shakespeare has done. We
are nowhere brought into a sympathetic relationship with the moral obliquity of either
Antony or Cleopatra. We are protected by the moral spirit with which the dramatist
works, from any perversion of the moral judgment. And this protection is positive
rather than negative; for the moral judgment is stimulated to its best activity,
throughout the play.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of the play, bearing on its moral spirit, is that part of its
narrated element which pertains to the hero and heroine&mdash;what is <hi rend="italic">told</hi> of Antony and
of Cleopatra, instead of being brought dramatically forward. Professor Delius, in his
valuable papers <hi rend="italic">On Shakespeare's Use of Narration in his Dramas,</hi> attributes too
<pb n="485"/>
much, perhaps, of the narrated element, to the deficiencies of the stage in Shakespeare's 
time, and not enough to the perspective the artist aimed after, by his use of
narration, and to the moral proportion of a play. What is thrown into the background 
by narration often serves moral proportion by its being thus kept apart from
our sympathies. This is especially the case with the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra.</hi> 
[See I, i, 46-53; I, i, 63-67; II, ii, 267-279; III, x, 26-29; III, xi, 55-80;
IV, xiv, 55-65; IV, xv, 27-30.] Now the point to be especially noted is, that
Cleopatra's fascination is, in the passages quoted, <hi rend="italic">described</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spoken of,</hi> rather than
brought dramatically to our feelings through what she herself says and does. These
descriptions of her charms do not bring us into any sympathetic relationship with her
personality. We simply <hi rend="italic">know of</hi> her charms. The dramatist does but little more
than the historian. Plutarch <hi rend="italic">tells</hi> us of her fascination, and so does Dion Cassius.
Both these writers emphasize it even more than Shakespeare does. But they narrate
it as historians. They address the fact to our minds. But the drama, if it be within
its purpose, should bring it, as far as possible, to our &aelig;sthetic appreciation, rather
than simply acquaint us with the fact. But it does not do so. In some, indeed in
all the scenes in which Cleopatra appears, she is not a very fascinating creature. Her
treatment of the messenger who brings her the news of Antony's marriage to Octavia
does not present her in a very attractive light; rather, in a very repulsive one (A. II.
Sc. V.). In her rage she is simply irrational. She beats the innocent messenger,
hales him up and down, and even prepares to kill him. She is almost divorced from
the moral constitution of things. Her will is the wind's will. Her fascination, as
represented by Shakespeare, is almost wholly a sexual one, exerted upon those who
are in her bodily presence.</p></quote></cit>

the drift of the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> this certainly may with truth be
said, that to strong natures that sicken under the weight of convention and are weary
with looking upon the littleness of human nature in its ordinary forms, it affords a
great and splendid, howsoever temporary, relief and refreshment. The winds of
power blow through it; the strong meridian sunshine blazes over it; the colours of
morning burn around it; the trumpet blares in its music; and its fragrance is the
scent of a wilderness of roses. Shakespeare's vast imagination was here loosed
upon colossal images and imperial splendours. The passions that clash or mingle
in this piece are like the ocean surges&mdash;fierce, glittering, terrible, glorious. The
theme is the ruin of a demigod. The adjuncts are empires. Wealth of every sort
is poured forth with regal and limitless profusion. The language glows with a prodigal 
emotion and towers to a superb height of eloquence. It does not signify, as
modifying the effect of all this tumult and glory, that the stern truth of mortal evanescence 
is suggested all the way and simply disclosed at last in a tragical wreck of
honour, love, and life. While the pageant endures it endures in diamond light, and
when it fades and crumbles the change is instantaneous to darkness and death.
&lsquo;The odds is gone, And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon.&rsquo;
There is no need to inquire whether Shakespeare&mdash;who closely followed Plutarch,
in telling the Roman and Egyptian story&mdash;has been true to the historical fact. His
characters declare themselves with absolute precision and they are not to be mistaken. 
Antony and Cleopatra are in middle life, and the only possible or admissible
ideal of them is that which separates them at once and forever from the gentle, puny,
experimental emotions of youth, and invests them with the developed powers and
<pb n="486"/>
fearless and exultant passions of men and women to whom the world and life are a
fact and not a dream. They do not palter. For them there is but one hour, which
is the present, and one life, which they will entirely and absolutely fulfil. They
have passed out of the mere instinctive life of the senses, into that more intense and
thrilling life wherein the senses are fed and governed by the imagination. Shakespeare 
has filled this wonderful play with lines that tell unerringly his grand meaning 
in this respect&mdash;lines that, to Shakespearean scholars, are in the alphabet of
memory: &lsquo;There's beggary in the love that can be reckoned.&rsquo; . . . &lsquo;There's not a
minute of our lives should stretch Without some pleasure now.&rsquo; . . . &lsquo;Let Rome in
Tiber melt and the wide arch Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space!&rsquo; . . .
&lsquo;O, thou day of the world, Chain mine armed neck! Leap thou, attire and all,
Through proof of harness, to my heart and there Ride on the pants triumphing.&rsquo; . . .
&lsquo;Fall not a tear, I say! one of them rates All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss;
Even this repays me.&rsquo; Here is no Orsino, sighing for the music that is the food of
love; no Romeo, taking the measure of an unmade grave; no Hamlet lover, bidding
his mistress go to a nunnery. You may indeed, if you possess the subtle, poetic
sense, hear, through this voluptuous story, the faint, far-off rustle of the garments
of the coming Nemesis; the low moan of the funeral music that will sing those
imperial lovers to their rest&mdash;for nothing is more inevitably doomed than mortal
delight in mortal love, and no moralist ever taught his lesson of truth with more
inexorable purpose than Shakespeare uses here. But in the meantime it is the
present vitality and not the moral implication of the subject that actors must be concerned 
to show, and observers to recognise and comprehend, upon the stage, if this
tragedy is to be rightly acted and rightly seen. Antony and Cleopatra are lovers,
but not lovers only. It is the splendid stature and infinite variety of character in
them that render them puissant in fascination. Each of them speaks great thoughts
in great language. Each displays noble imagination. Each becomes majestic in
the hour of danger and pathetically heroic in the hour of death. The dying speeches
of Antony are in the highest vein that Shakespeare ever reached; and, when you
consider what is implied as well as what is said, there is nowhere in him a more
lofty line than Cleopatra's &lsquo;Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have immortal
&lsquo;longings in me!&rsquo; Antony at the last is a ruin, and like a ruin&mdash;dark, weird, grim,
lonely, haggard&mdash;he seems to stand beneath a cold and lurid sunset sky, wherein the
black clouds gather, while the rising wind blows merciless and terrible over an intervening 
waste of rock and desert. Those images indicate the spirit and atmosphere
of Shakespeare's conception.</p></quote></cit>

of North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch,</hi> to select his <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Antonius</hi>?
The answer, I think, must be that in Volumnia, Calpurnia and Portia, and Cleopatra,
he found woman in her three-fold relation to man, of mother, wife, and mistress. I
have passed over Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi>; but I may end by tracing in his
<hi rend="italic">Antony</hi> the golden tradition he accepted from Amyot and North. It is impossible
to do this in detail, for throughout the first three Acts all the colour and the incident,
throughout the last two all the incident and the passion, are taken by Shakespeare
from North, and by North from Amyot. Shakespeare, indeed, is saturated with
North's language and possessed by his passion. He is haunted by the story as North
has told it, so that he even fails to eliminate matters which either are nothing to his
<pb n="487"/>
purpose or are not susceptible of dramatic presentment: as in I, ii of the Folios,
where you find Lamprias, Plutarch's grandfather, and his authority for many details
of Antony's career, making an otiose entry as Lamprius, among the characters who
have something to say. Everywhere are touches whose colour must remain comparatively 
pale unless they glow again for us as, doubtless, they glowed for Shakespeare, 
with hues reflected from the passages in North that shone in his memory.
During his first three Acts Shakespeare merely paints the man and the woman who
are to suffer and die in his two others; and for these portraits he has scraped together
all his colour from the many such passages as are scattered through the earlier and
longer portion of North's <hi rend="italic">Antonius.</hi> But in the Fourth Act Shakespeare changes his
method: he has no more need to gather and arrange. Rather the concentrated
passion, born of, and contained in, North's serried narrative, expands in his verse&mdash;
nay, explodes from it&mdash;into those flashes of immortal speech which have given the
Fourth Act of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> its place apart even in Shakespeare. Of all
that may be said of North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch,</hi> this perhaps is of deepest significance: that
every dramatic incident in Shakespeare's Fourth Act is contained in two, and in his

the superb rhythmical swell of many passages, the work is unsurpassed. But it has
a grave share of the defects to which Romantic Drama had been liable from the first,
especially when it was drawing upon historical materials. . . . Shakspere seems to
have felt a conscientious obligation to introduce every incident, political or private,
mentioned by Plutarch, and the result is a loss of dramatic unity and perspective.
The multiplicity of details is bewildering, and no single event stands out boldly as
the pivot on which the catastrophe turns. But this artistic defect is here in part the
outcome of a significant peculiarity in Shakspere's treatment of love as a dramatic
theme. Sexual passion is the immediate subject of only three plays, <hi rend="italic">Romeo and
Juliet, Troilus and Cressida,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra.</hi> In each case the emotional
interest is interwoven with elements of a political nature&mdash;the civil strife of Montagues 
and Capulets, the war between the Greeks and the Trojans, the struggle for
the lordship of the Roman world. Thus Shakspere, even when making an elaborate
study of amorous passion, does not isolate it from the wider, more material, issues of
surrounding civic or national life. He thus avoids the disastrous pitfall of treating
love as the exclusive factor in existence&mdash;a method which, according to the nature of
the love chosen for analysis, tends to produce an unwholesome sentimentality or a
still more unwholesome prurience. Shakspere opens to our view hearts aflame with
chaste affection or with sensuous desire, but he never cheats himself or others into
the belief that sexual relationship is the solitary, imperious concern of all mankind.
From the kaleidoscopic changes of Cleopatra's moods he turns our gaze to the legions
tramping in solid array through the uttermost parts of the earth, or to the council-chambers 
where the destinies of kingdoms are being decided by the stroke of a pen.
We are shown in turn every aspect of the most materialistic age in the world's history, 
the age when Roman civic virtue was, in its death-throes, suffocated by the
plethora of its golden spoils from the South and the East.</p></quote></cit>

exhibitions the poet has afforded of that almost divine insight and intuition which
<pb n="488"/>
enabled him to comprehend at a glance that complete whole of which other men,
after painful toil, learn but a beggarly part. The student of ancient history can find
in the play occasional disregard of precise dates. He can discover, in some cases, a
sequence of events which is not in absolutely strict accord with the account of them
that has been handed down. But from no investigation of records, from no interpretation 
of texts, will he ever arrive at so clear and vivid a conception of the characters 
of the actors who then took part in the struggle for the supremacy of the world.
Nowhere in ancient story or song will he find, as here, the light which enables him
to see the men as they are. It is a gorgeous gallery in which each personage stands
out so distinct that there is no danger of misapprehension or confusion as to the parts
they fill. Antony appears the soldier and voluptuary he was, swayed alternately by
love, by regret, by ambition, at one moment the great ruler of the divided world, at
the next recklessly flinging his future away at the dictation of a passionate caprice;
Cleopatra, true to no interest, fascinating, treacherous, charming with her grace those
whom she revolts by her conduct, luring the man she half loves to a ruin which
involves herself in his fate; Octavius, cool, calculating, never allowing his heart to
gain, either for good or evil, the better of his head, showing in early youth the self-
restraint, the caution, the knowledge of the world which belong to advancing years;
the feeble Lepidus, striving to act the part of a reconciler to the two mighty opposites, 
with whom the irony of fate has thrown him into conjunction: these and half-
a-dozen minor characters appear painted in clear and sharp outline on the crowded
canvas of Shakespeare; while in attendance, like the chorus of a Greek tragedy,
stands Enobarbus, commenting on every incident of the great world-drama which is
acted before his eyes, ominously foreboding the declining fortunes of his chief in
the moral ruin which carries with it prostration of the intellect, and pointing to the
inevitable catastrophe of shame and dishonor to which events are hurrying.</p></quote></cit>

between two, like <hi rend="italic">Timon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pericles,</hi> produced with the help of collaborators. The
question, however, is not material, for both show Shakespeare's restoration to a sane
and cheerful view of life. <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> is pre-eminently the work of one
interested in the &lsquo;world's great business.&rsquo; Hardly anywhere else is there such bustle,
such variety, such zest for political and military affairs. Shakespeare is thoroughly
in charity with his principal characters. His treatment of Cleopatra is purely objective, 
there is no trace of personal resentment, as in his portrait of Cressida. In
Antony he has marvellously depicted &lsquo;the average sensual man,&rsquo; on a far lower
plane than a noble idealist like Brutus, but still capable of deep human feeling. This
was shown in <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar,</hi> by the great speeches beginning &lsquo;O pardon me, thou
&lsquo;bleeding piece of earth,&rsquo; and &lsquo;This was the noblest Roman of them all.&rsquo; In <hi rend="italic">Antony
and Cleopatra</hi> this depth of feeling is entirely devoted to a woman; and so intense,
especially under the influence of jealousy, so sincere, so single-minded, save for one
vacillation under stress of politics, is it that we overlook the fact that we have before
us an Antony in decay, no longer able to sway the Roman multitude or school Octavius.
Wisdom and policy are gone forever, even martial honour is dimmed, but love makes
amends for all. Such a picture necessarily implies a corresponding brilliancy in the
<pb n="489"/>
portrait of Cleopatra, and it is needless to remark that she is perhaps the most wonderful 
of all Shakespeare's studies of female character. He follows Plutarch's delineation 
closely, but performs the same miracle upon it as Venus wrought upon the
effigy of Galatea: a beautiful image becomes a living being. Perhaps the keynote
of the personality is what Shakespeare terms &lsquo;her infinite variety&rsquo;; there is room in
her for every phase of female character. The same amplitude characterises the play
itself, with its great sweep in time and place, its continual changes of scene, its crowd
of personages, its multitude of speeches and profusion of poetical imagery. The contrast 
with <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi> is instructive. There the interest is more concentrated, the
characterisation more minute, and the execution more laborious. The ease with
which Shakespeare handles his theme in the later play, and the plasticity of the
entire subject in his hands, manifest the perfection of his art by dint of practice, but
impair the effectiveness of his piece on the stage. The actor has fewer grand opportunities 
than of yore, and although the drama is resplendent with poetical phrases,
there are few sustained outbursts of passion or eloquence. The impersonation of
Cleopatra, moreover, demands an actress of mature years. In Shakespeare's time
there was no difficulty, for there were no actresses. The representation of his Cleopatra 
by a <hi rend="italic">boy</hi> strikes us now as indescribably farcical.</p></quote></cit>

orator, soldier and debauchee; a Henry V. without his power of self-control&mdash;furnished

of Cleopatra, as recorded by Plutarch, joined (for she is no Cressida) to a
certain greatness of soul and fidelity of passion, must have struck the poet's imagination

painted in his <hi rend="italic">Sonnets.</hi> The use of the word &lsquo;will&rsquo; in this remarkable play is
noticeable. When Antony has left the battle of Actium, to his own dishonour, in
pursuit of the flying Cleopatra, the queen asks the shrewd, worldly, and calculating 
Enobarbus, who is introduced into the play as a kind of chorus to comment on
Antony and his fortunes: &lsquo;Is Antony or we in fault for this?&rsquo; Enobarbus replies:
&lsquo;Antony only, that would make his will Lord of his reason.&rsquo; (III, xiii.) Yet Antony
throughout the play recognises that he is acting against his deliberate resolution,
under the irresistible influence of passion: &lsquo;I followed that I blush to look upon:
My very hairs do mutiny; for the white Reprove the brown for rashness, and they
them For fear and doting.&rsquo; (III, xi.) So that his conduct is what Iago calls &lsquo;merely
a lust of the blood and <hi rend="italic">permission</hi> of the will.&rsquo; (I, iii.) This is the very helplessness

we close the book in a triumph which is more than reconciliation, this is mingled, as
we look back on the story, with a sadness so peculiar, almost the sadness of disenchantment? 
Is it that, when the glow has faded, Cleopatra's ecstasy comes to appear,
I would not say factitious, but an effort strained and prodigious as well as glorious,
not, like Othello's last speech, the final expression of character, of thoughts and
emotions which have dominated a whole life? Perhaps this is so, but there is something 
more, something that sounds paradoxical: we are saddened by the very fact
that the catastrophe saddens us so little; it pains us that we should feel so much triumph 
and pleasure. In &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo; &lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; &lsquo;Othello,&rsquo; though in a sense
we accept the deaths of hero and heroine, we feel a keen sorrow. We look back,
think how noble or beautiful they were, wish that fate had opposed to them a weaker
enemy, dream possibly of the life they might then have led. Here we can hardly
do this. With all our admiration and sympathy for the lovers we do not wish them
to gain the world. It is better for the world's sake, and not less for their own, that
they should fail and die. At the very first they came before us, unlike those others,
unlike Coriolanus and even Macbeth, in a glory already tarnished, half-ruined by
their past. Indeed one source of strange and most unusual effect in their story is
that this marvellous passion comes to adepts in the experience and art of passion,
who might be expected to have worn its charm away. Its splendour dazzles us;
but, when the splendour vanishes, we do not mourn, as we mourn for the love of
Romeo or Othello, that a thing so bright and good should die. And the fact that
we mourn so little saddens us.</p>
<p>A comparison of Shakespearean tragedies seems to prove that the tragic emotions
are stirred in the fullest possible measure only when such beauty or nobility of character 
is displayed as commands unreserved admiration or love; or when, in default
of this, the forces which move the agents, and the conflict which results from these
forces, attain a terrifying and overwhelming power. The four most famous tragedies
satisfy one or both of these conditions; &lsquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rsquo; though a great
tragedy, satisfies neither of them completely. But to say this is not to criticise it. It
does not attempt to satisfy these conditions, and then fail in the attempt. It attempts
something different, and succeeds as triumphantly as &lsquo;Othello&rsquo; itself. In doing so
it gives us what no other tragedy can give, and it leaves us, no less than any other,
lost in astonishment at the powers which created it.</p></quote></cit>

and in the actions of the drama, no really elevating feature, either in its politics or
in its love-affairs. This play seems to make us intuitively aware how much we
should lose in Shakespeare, if, with his confessedly great knowledge of men and
nature, there did not go, hand in hand, &aelig;sthetic excellence (the ideal concentration
of actors and actions), and ethical excellence (the ideal height of what is represented
as human nature). The poet had to set forth a debased period in his <hi rend="italic">Antony and
Cleopatra</hi>; for the truth of history, he did so adequately; but this did not exclude
him from giving a glance at a better state of human nature, which, amid so much
degradation, might comfort and elevate us. If we recall the <hi rend="italic">Historical Plays,</hi> where
Shakespeare had to depict generations, for the most part degenerate and ruined, we
shall find that in <hi rend="italic">Richard II.</hi> there was, as a compensation, a Gaunt and a Carlisle;
and even in <hi rend="italic">Richard III.,</hi> the few strokes that depicted the sons of Edward, are a
beneficent counterpoise to the wide-spread wickedness. Here, however, there is
nothing of the kind, and we may even affirm that the opportunity for such a counterbalance 
has been conspicuously evaded: it would surely have been easy, in the character 
of Octavia at least, to keep before us some views of what is more noble in
human nature; even if it were by only a few traits, which would have exhibited her
to us in action, where now she is merely described to us in words. Let me introduce
an observation here, which will set this singular defect in <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> in
a still stronger light. It seems to us, in truth, as though Shakespeare, about 1607-
10, had, we will not say a period but, seasons when he composed his poetry, in general, 
somewhat more carelessly, be it regarded either &aelig;sthetically or ethically. What
may have been the cause of that which is here conjectured, we can hardly fathom.
It is, indeed, possible, that at about this time his aversion to everything pertaining
to the theatre, might have seized him more strongly; it may be also possible, that
some indications of physical exhaustion had already set in, and that these may have
been the cause of his retirement, and the first intimation of his early death.
<note place="foot" anchored="yes">Shakespeare died at the age of fifty-two years. This is early, but not quite as

Cleopatra in a more advantageous light than was befitting, and clothed the voluptuaries 
with a certain exalted splendour, that betrays a decided partiality for them.
But whatever he did in this respect, was undoubtedly done, not from moral levity,
but for &aelig;sthetic purposes. Had Shakespeare taken Antony exactly as he found him
in Plutarch, never would he have been able to represent him as a tragic character,
or have excited an interest in him in his relations with Cleopatra. . . . It is wonderful, 
how Shakespeare so preserved the historical features of Antony's character, as,
on the one hand, not to make him unrecognizable, and yet, on the other, to make of
him an attractive personage.</p></quote></cit>

here brought in contact, which, in good qualities as well as bad, are as completely
complemental to each other, as their elevation is high above the average of mankind.
A ruler of the universe, who has tasted to the last drop all that the world offers both
of toil and of self-indulgence, meets a queen who can also say that nothing human is
alien to her. Both stand at the very highest hey-day of life, and are in complete
fullness of their powers. Long before reaching this point, both would have been, in
modern phrase, <hi rend="italic">blas&eacute;s,</hi> had not the inexhaustible, classic life of the senses endowed
each of them with eternal youth. Thus nature, by a species of necessity, binds them
to each other; each beholds a recognised counterpart in the opposite sex. It is in
both a final passion, which, because it is the last, blazes up with all the intensity of
a first love; in a moment, it makes these two mature, world-worn beings, children
again, and, with the same lightheartedness, as ever a Romeo or a Juliet, wafts them
above all dangers of their time, and all duties of their station. The only difference
between them and those two young lovers is that they were <hi rend="italic">conscious</hi> of their state
and had reduced their intoxicating revel to a system, and diversified their enjoyments
with all the refinement of an exquisite art of living.</p>
<p>(Page vi): Up to this point [where Anthony leaves Octavia and returns to Cleopatra] 
the general public will understand the hero, and follow his conduct with sympathy. 
Thus far he differs in no respect from other enamoured heroes, who <foreign lang="de">&lsquo;sich

<note place="foot" anchored="yes">That is, &lsquo;who fight with men, and flirt with women,&rsquo; from a Student-song by

and to whom a pardon for
even some suspicious weaknesses will be extended for the sake of a certain romantic
chivalry. But when, at the very crisis of his fate, he leaves the naval battle because
his mistress from womanish timidity sets sail and flies,&mdash;from that moment he forfeits,
in the opinion of the majority, all claim to any tragic sympathy, and it is doubtful
if, throughout the rest of the play, he ever quite regains it. Here is a point, where,
in my opinion, the psychological problem becomes too fine, too exceptional, too deep
for a dramatic performance. The conception of a woman, with a power so demoniacal 
that it mystifies both sense and reason, as here floated before the imagination
of the poet, perhaps before his memory,&mdash;for we must seek in the confessions of the
<hi rend="italic">Sonnets</hi> for the earliest studies of this Cleopatra,&mdash;will rarely find on the stage an
incarnation, which, even to a certain extent, will justify the hero, in holding indifferent 
the gain or loss of a hemisphere in comparison with separation from his enchantress. 
When we can be brought to believe in such an elemental power of this passion,
then and then only can we face the shame of this hero, not with a disapproving shrug,
but with that tragic shock, which the horror of every inexorable fate always awakens

<pb n="493"/>
in us. I must deny myself the illustration by separate examples of that lavish exuberance 
of characteristics wherewith the hand of genius has set forth the figure of the
Egyptian Queen. I honestly believe it to be the very greatest masterpiece of female
characterisation; alongside of which there can be placed no more richly devised figure
in the whole literature of modern romance, whereof the strength lies in psychologic
analysis and vivid contrasts. With equal poetic power and depth is the character of
Anthony depicted to the very last; both are to be measured separately, just as both
separately are overtaken by a fate so completely interwoven that the flame of passion,
which transfigures them at the close with a wondrous glory, reflects its glow back to
the beginning of the play and illumines many a shadow. The scholastic view, which
turns Shakespeare into a conscientious moralist, above all things anxious to display,
in the fate of mortals, the equipoise of guilt and expiation, appears, as it seems to me,
in no single play in such embarrassing perplexity as in the presence of this tragedy;
which undoubtedly preaches with a hundred tongues the lesson, in Goethe's striking
words, that &lsquo;self-indulgence and achievement are incompatible.&rsquo; But a single principle, 
founded on experience, and, among others, objectively contained in a poem,
cannot on that account claim to be considered the soul of the whole work. If the
poet had chosen this material in order to warn the world against being fooled by
self-indulgence, because it disables the power of achievement, he would have devised
the development very differently. In spite of the gross stain wherewith this hero
of self-indulgence, this heroic <hi rend="italic">rou&eacute;,</hi> has defiled himself, his character decidedly over-
shadows the discreet, cool, efficient, and, in fact, victorious rival. Extremely few
readers will waver in their choice as to which they would give the preference, to the
cold-blooded C&aelig;sar or to the warm-blooded Marc Anthony. And even an audience
of women would not remain insensible to Cleopatra's charm. But if a majority could
be really found, who, in spite of the tragic downfall, did not cease to deem the aristocratic 
autocracy of these natures as criminal, the minority could console themselves
that they had on their own side the poet himself. There arose before him the dazzling 
apparition of such a pair, that &lsquo;stood up peerless,&rsquo; and it stimulated his creative
power. Whatsoever was holy and unholy in such a tie, everything that an average
morality could plead against it, was undoubtedly as ever present to him as to his
critics of today. And although it may not have stood written in history, his higher
comprehension and knowledge of the world taught him the inflexible law that even
the most highly endowed man must succumb as soon as he &lsquo;would make his will
&lsquo;Lord of his reason.&rsquo; Shakespeare, with his incorruptible honesty, neither concealed
all this, nor adorned it. Nay, there are traces of even a certain defiance in the sharp
prominence given to what is hateful and mean. He allows it freely to unfold itself
in sharp realistic features of every-day life. In his heart, however, he is aware that
he has but to await the propitious moment to melt all this dross into an irresistible
glow and refine it. He could not have been the poet that he is, the richly endowed
son of Mother Nature, had he not known himself to be a blood relation to whatsoever 
of nobility she had brought forth. When he saw, in this pair, the powers of a
luxurious life bloom forth and wither in obedience to the law of all earthly things, a
tragic pain broke from his heart, which had no rest until he had adorned their grave
with all the treasures of poesy, and, by the most affecting funeral ceremony, rendered
their death immortal.</p></quote></cit>

footing with the principal character in the action of a Shakespearean tragedy. But
what a contrast between Juliet and Cleopatra: one, a young girl, hardly more than
a child, whom the might of a pure and unselfish passion transforms into a woman,
whose whole being is absorbed by this love which consummates her character and
her life; the other, a courtesan of genius, if I may say so, with experience of life
and the world, devoted to pleasure, practiced in all the arts of seduction, endowed
by nature with an alluring witchery, to whom the fire of her love for Antony alone
lends a glimmer of womanly dignity. Artistically considered, Cleopatra is, perhaps,
the masterpiece among Shakespeare's female characters; given the problem, Shakespeare 
has solved it as no one else could have done. But what conflicts must his
soul have endured, what bitter experiences must he have passed through, to have set
himself such a problem, to have created a woman so widely different from all those
he had pictured before&mdash;a woman so devoid of the ideal womanly graces, yet so
irresistible, for whose sake Antony sacrifices the dominion of the world.</p></quote></cit>

that Shakespeare, in his climatic and geographical references to the native land of
Cleopatra, remains first of all a poet unsurpassed in truth to nature. Every student
of geography, even without any thought of Egypt in his mind, would at once assign
the land represented in this play to a chartographic zone wherein the climate, the
flora, the fauna, and the human race were all thoroughly consistent. And at the
same time the poet has striven to reflect symbolically, in the character of the land
itself and especially in its animal life, the fatal nature of the passion of the hero and
heroine&mdash;an aim which he has attained with his usual supremacy. Finally, the poet
has given, as an illustration, an historical law, founded in the nature of all races.
Wheresoever the inhabitants of any country in which nature yields her gifts in lavish,
prodigal profusion, suffer themselves, by this profusion to be seduced to a love of
pleasure, from that hour they are doomed to decay, and must become subject to an
alien race from rougher climates. Without assuming that it was the poet's first or
chief intention to give a proof of this, we can at least assert that, with a small expenditure 
of means, he has supplied it. At all events, in the drama before us, Shakespeare 
has penetrated to the creative power of Nature and has overheard her secrets;
with greater truth can he say of himself, what the Soothsayer claims with self-conscious 
modesty, that &lsquo;in Nature's infinite book of secrecy a little I can read.&rsquo;
However widely critics may differ in their views of our poet's artistic power and perfection 
they are of one mind in a recognition of the uniformity of his local colouring.
In conclusion let me quote the remarks of <name type="authority">R&uuml;melin</name> at the close of his criticism of the
Roman plays: &lsquo;Although Shakespeare makes his Roman heroes think and speak
&lsquo;like English lords and barons,&rsquo; says R&uuml;melin,
<note place="foot" anchored="yes"><hi rend="italic">Shakespearestudien,</hi> p. 108, 1866.</note>
&lsquo;he knew how to impart to his plays
and to his characters a very effective geographic <hi rend="italic">nuance</hi>; if he imagined himself in
any particular country, his phantasy assumed a certain tinct which diffused itself
over every object. Throughout <hi rend="italic">Macbeth, Hamlet, Lear</hi> there blows a keen northern 
wind, but in <hi rend="italic">Romeo,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">The Merchant of Venice</hi> from the very first we feel the
southern warmth. In like manner, these Roman plays seem to have a similar
local colour, a warmer tone, as far as they may be said to have any specific tone
at all.&rsquo;</p></quote></cit>

of the race of Semiramis and of Zenobia, between her and Antony there is enacted
not merely a love-story but a great political undertaking. Along side of the riotous
festivities of Alexandria there was advancing a powerful political and social movement 
which was to shake the world. On this rock, of which he was only dimly conscious, 
rather than clearly perceiving it, Shakespeare's poetry was wrecked. It is
not the continuous shifting of the scene, whereby we are chased as though by a
storm from Alexandria to Rome on board of Pompey's galley, from Rome to Actium,
and back to Alexandria; it is not the messengers, the servants, the guards, who
necessarily, by their news, spin out the thread of the action, that break up and shatter 
the dramatic unity; it is the material itself, as Shakespeare has comprehended
it, which has remained in the epic form of a chronicle. The poet has neither
known how, out of the numberless persons, to select the most important, nor, out of
the superabundance of circumstances, to eliminate the weightiest; consequently the
drama lacks genuine core and deliquesces like pap [<hi rend="italic">breiartig</hi>]. In not a single instance
is the contrast between Antony and Octavius sharply defined, and the perpetual love-
making of the hero and heroine, which rises and falls in a monotonous alternation
from tender cooing to furious execrations, is at first comic, but at last tedious. Very
possibly, admirers of Shakespeare may accept it differently, but to my taste, a good
third of the speeches of Antony and of Cleopatra trenches close on the bombast of the
weaker tragedy of Corneille. There is no attempt at a development of character in
the grand style; from the beginning to the end, Cleopatra is a quarrelsome woman,
who, in the scenes with the messenger and with Seleucus, strikingly proves that, on
the old English stage such <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;les</hi> of Furies and fish-wives could have been played only
by young men, for whom they were written.</p></quote></cit>

guilty love of Antony and Cleopatra, a subject that would have presented an almost
insuperable difficulty to a poor little poet of a narrow and mediocre type; quite at a
loss, and biting his pen the while, he would have said to himself, &lsquo;What is to be
done? Cleopatra is a very wicked woman, a <hi rend="italic">monster,</hi> as Horace calls her,&mdash;a
mixture of all we most hate and despise, she is a coquette, timid, cowardly, cringing, 
perfidious, tyrannical, cruel and wanton. To interest decent people in such a
creature is clearly impossible, except by making a selection from among the contradictory 
features of her character, and since Plutarch speaks of her as being occasionally 
generous, tender and devoted, heroic and sublime, I must convert the conception
into the rule, and put an expurgated Cleopatra on the stage.&rsquo; But Shakespeare
reasoned in a very different manner. He started with the notion of Cleopatra as an
enchantress, and he trusted with quiet confidence to the power of his poetry, and to
his sure knowledge of the human heart, to make the same fascination that she exercised 
over her lovers be felt by us: her faults, her vices, her crimes&mdash;what do they
matter? Besides which, it betrays a good deal of simplicity to suppose that certain
sins which are repulsive in a man are equally odious when met with in a woman. A
man is ugly, and has hard work to atone for his natural ugliness, but, as a poet has
said,&mdash;and it is no empty compliment, but an astute psychological truth,&mdash;women, do
what they will, are always charming: <foreign lang="fr">&lsquo;On en peut, par hasard, trouver qui sont

<p>Shakespeare has not deemed it necessary to leave out any of the stains, big or

of depriving the lovely little monster of a single charm, only makes her the more

hand, let these same events occur in the very highest circle of public life; let the
courtesan be called Cleopatra, and let her wear a crown; let the spendthrift husband
be called Antony and reign over the East; and let the brother who avenges the
insulted wife be called Octavius and be master of the Occident; then the whole
known world will find itself involved in a household quarrel; the mourning of one
family will bring about the mourning of the human race. The earth will tremble
beneath the tramp of armies, the sea under the weight of fleets; nation will challenge 
nation and both rush at each other; Alexandria will hurl defiance at Carthage;
Rome and Athens will fly at each other's throats. A hundred thousand men, twelve
thousand horses, three hundred ships will hardly suffice to uphold the cause of the
courtesan; to the rescue will throng Bocchus, the king of Libya, Tarcodemus, the
king of Cilicia, Archelaus, the king of Cappadocia, Philadelphus, the king of Paphlagonia, 
Mithridates, the king of Commagena, Adallas, the king of Thrace, Polemon, 
the king of Pontus, Manchus, the king of Arabia, Amynthas, the king of the
Lycaonians and Galatheans, Herod, the king of the Jews, and the king of the
Medes. Eighty thousand veterans, twelve thousand horsemen, and two hundred
and fifty ships will not be too many to uphold the rights of the lawful wife; Italy,
Spain, Gaul will send their legions, and Europe, from Slavonia to the Atlantic, will
be in motion. O amazing logic of facts! Can a cause so puny have such vast
results! Can a lever sufficient to lift the globe be found in the smile of a mad-cap

houses to fill the galleys; muleteers, harvesters, travellers on the road are seized

torch in hand, rush over the earth; the heavens are reddened with a fateful glow, it
is blazing villages, lit by squadrons,&mdash;the Orient and the Occident, for long ages
defiant, have met at last. The shock befell before the promontory of Actium. The
Orient recoils before the Occident.</p>
<p>(Page 16): Shakespeare for ever brings back the interest to this sovereign figure
which gives to the work its unity. Present or absent, Cleopatra pervades the entire
drama. Even at the feast which the young Pompey spreads for the Triumvirs aboard
his galley, even at that monstrous orgy where wine turns the head of the noblest,
where Lepidus rolls under the table, where Antony staggers and where C&aelig;sar stammers, 
it is Cleopatra who, unperceived, presides. Cleopatra is the fatal enchantress
who initiated Rome into the startling mysteries of oriental voluptuousness. She is
the invisible sorceress who sweeps the masters of the globe into the dizzy whirl of
an Egyptian bacchanal. . . . Cleopatra is the supreme type of seduction. The spell
which she weaves is the greatest triumph of feminine magic. Her sisters, the other
heroines of Shakespeare, attract us only by their virtues and by their qualities; she,
she enchants us by her very faults, her very weaknesses. . . . Fully assured of the
irresistible charm of his heroine, the poet does not, for a single instant, suffer us to
be under any illusion. From the very beginning of the drama, at the moment when
she enters on the arm of her lover, he tells us what she is with the utmost frankness.
&lsquo;Look,&rsquo; he cries, &lsquo;and you shall see in him The triple pillar of the world transform'd
&lsquo;Into a strumpet's fool.&rsquo; Away with reticence, away with ambiguity! Shakespeare
has neither the timidity of Corneille nor that of Dryden; he does not evade the subject,
<pb n="498"/>
he faces it full front. He does not deny his heroine, he proclaims her. It is
a &lsquo;strumpet&rsquo; that he installs on the scene; it is to a &lsquo;strumpet&rsquo; that he attracts our
interest; it is for a &lsquo;strumpet&rsquo; that he demands our pity; it is for the death of a
&lsquo;strumpet&rsquo; and her lover that he exacts our tears. Omnipotence of genius! In this
drama, where an outraged wife reclaims her rights from a courtesan, it is not the
wife who enlists our sympathy, it is the courtesan! She whom we compassionate, is
not Octavia, the austere, the chaste; it is this light o' love whom Antony had found
as a &lsquo;morsel cold upon dead C&aelig;sar's trencher.&rsquo; But by what means has the poet
been enabled to produce such a change in the consciences of the spectators, and to
concentrate on Cleopatra all the sympathy that should be due to Octavia? To work
this miracle Shakespeare needed to tell nothing but the truth; he had merely to
reveal to us the profound sentiment which inspired his heroine. Cleopatra had in
her heart the flame that purifies everything: she loves. It is by love that the royal
courtesan stands revealed; it is by love that she is rehabilitated. Ay, this Antony
whom she teases, whom she torments, whom she maddens, this Antony whom at one
moment she abjures and unscrupulously deceives with Thyreus, she loves him, she
loves him to distraction. Do you doubt? Listen. The minute that Antony is
absent, Cleopatra is utterly desolate. She thinks only of him, she speaks only of
him; she intoxicates herself with mandragora to sleep out the great gap of his
absence.</p>
<p>(Page 20): In Plutarch Antony lives long with Octavia, in Shakespeare the marriage 
was a mere formality. Who does not see in this perversion of history, by the
hand of genius, a feature of exquisite delicacy? The poet would not suffer his hero
to be for a single instant unfaithful to his heroine; he has not permitted a single
treason, even if legalised, to profane this sanctified adultery. To Shakespeare, the
union of Antony and Octavia was never aught else than an ephemeral bargain arranged
by policy; but his union with Cleopatra is an everlasting compact, sealed by devotion.
Thus the poet does not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second. In his eyes, that
which sanctifies the relations between man and woman is less social convention than
the natural law. Let two beings love each other, let them live the one for the
other, that is sufficient; they are affianced for ever, all other engagements to the
contrary notwithstanding. In the eyes of posterity, as in Shakespeare's, the spouse
of Antony is no longer Octavia, it is Cleopatra. The intensity of the passion is its
legitimacy.</p>
<p>What a contrast between Antony and Cleopatra, Romeo and Juliet. The latter
are young, loyal, and candid; there is never a wrinkle on their brow nor remorse in
their heart; their characters are pure like their affection; their souls are as virgin as
their bodies. Their accord is a continuous effusion of tenderness; it is an harmonious
duet with not a murmur of discord. What he dreams, she sees; what she perceives
he accepts. Sighs answer to sighs, tears to tears, kisses to kisses. The innocence
of the Christian lovers is equaled only by the corruption of the pagan lovers. Antony
is as vicious as Romeo is honest; Cleopatra is as dissolute as Juliet is chaste. The
union of the Roman and the Egyptian is the evil conjunction of two great souls which
absolute power has made monstrous; this union is sombre like the storm, raucous
like a debauch, dishevelled like an orgy. The nations crushed by despotism contemplate 
with terror this Titanic passion which roars above their heads and bursts forth
in bolts of lightning. Between the Triumvir and the Queen of Egypt there are only
quarrels, recriminations, sarcasms, invectives! But what does it matter! They love
each other; and such is the grandeur of their love that we forget their crimes. . . .
<pb n="499"/>
Our compassion rebels against our equity, and the death of Antony and Cleopatra
wounds us as sorely as the death of Romeo and Juliet. In sooth, the same
fatality which hurries on the latter, drives on the former. For the one as for the
other, suicide is a necessity. The likeness between the two catastrophes is such that
it seems as though in preparing them, destiny had plagiarised itself. This surprising 
analogy has not been adequately considered, which, even in the details, provokes 
comparison. The two <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;no&ucirc;ments</hi> take place amid the same funereal scenes;
on the one hand it is the tomb of the Ptolemies, on the other the tomb of the Capulets. 
Run down by adversity the pagan lovers, like the Christian lovers, are driven
to bay at the sepulchre; it is to the sepulchre that they betake themselves; at the
sepulchre is their last tryst. In the two dramas, the same error is followed by the
same consequences: Antony believes Cleopatra dead and kills himself; Romeo
believes Juliet dead and kills himself. The attachment of the women keeps pace
with the devotion of the men; both refuse to save themselves. The one resists the
solicitations of C&aelig;sar, the other the prayer of Friar Laurence. &lsquo;I trust only my
&lsquo;resolution,&rsquo; says one, as she applies the aspic. &lsquo;I will not away!&rsquo; cries the other,
and she seizes the poniard. Conclusion sublime! Between these two couples who
have lived so differently, infinite love has suppressed all differences; it effaces all distinction

in agony of the Veronese, it gives to adultery the august majesty of marriage. &lsquo;Husband,
I come.&rsquo; Yes, the same name that Juliet gives to Romeo, Cleopatra at last
conquers the right to give to Antony; at the moment when she kills herself for him,
she may well be permitted to call him her husband. The two lovers in dying have
exchanged the kiss of an eternal betrothal. Between her and him, there is no more
separation to be feared, no divorce possible. . . . Entombed by their conqueror, Antony
and Cleopatra repose side by side in the nuptial grave. Death has been their marriage.</p></quote></cit>

history, of Plutarch himself, would have been no subject for poetry. Splendidly
endowed by nature as he was, it would yet have been impossible to claim or create
a sympathy for one so cruel, dyed so deeply in the noblest blood of Rome, the wholesale 
plunderer of peaceful cities and provinces that he might squander their spoils on
the vilest ministers of his pleasures; himself of orgies so shameless, sunken in such
a mire of sin; in whom met the ugliest features, and what one would have counted
beforehand as the irreconcilable contradictions, of an Oriental despot and a Roman
gladiator. And yet, transformed, we may say transfigured by the marvellous touch,
the Antony of Shakespeare, if not the veritable Antony of history, has not so broken
with him as not to be recognizable still. For the rest, what was coarse is refined,
what would take no colour of goodness is ignored, what had any fair side on which
it could be shown is shown on that side alone. He appears from the first as not
himself, but as under the spells of that potent Eastern enchantress who had once held
by these spells a C&aelig;sar himself. There are followers who cleave to him in his lowest
estate, even as there are fitful gleams and glimpses of generosity about him which
explain this fidelity of theirs; and when at the last we behold him standing amid the
wreck of fortunes and the waste of gifts, all wrecked and wasted by himself, penetrated 
through and through with the infinite shame and sadness of such a close to such
a life, the whole range of poetry offers no more tragical figure than he is, few that

poetical conception; the latter, miraculous as a work of art. If we could make a
regular classification of his characters, these would form the two extremes of simplicity
and complexity; and all his other characters would be found to fill up some shade or
gradation between these two. Great crimes, springing from high passions, grafted
on high qualities, are the legitimate source of tragic poetry. But to make the extreme
of littleness produce an effect like grandeur&mdash;to make the excess of frailty produce
an effect like power&mdash;to heap up together all that is most unsubstantial, frivolous, vain,
contemptible, and variable, till the worthlessness be lost in the magnitude, and a
sense of the sublime spring from the very elements of littleness,&mdash;to do this, belonged
only to Shakespeare, that worker of miracles. Cleopatra is a brilliant antithesis, a
compound of contradictions, of all that we most hate, with what we most admire.
The whole character is the triumph of the external over the innate; and yet like one
of her country's hieroglyphics, though she present at first view a splendid and perplexing 
anomaly, there is deep meaning and wondrous skill in the apparent enigma,
when we come to analyze and decipher it. But how are we to arrive at the solution
of this glorious riddle, whose dazzling complexity continually mocks and eludes us?
What is most astonishing in the character of Cleopatra is its antithetical construction
&mdash;its <hi rend="italic">consistent inconsistency,</hi> if I may use such an expression&mdash;which renders it quite
impossible to reduce it to any elementary principles. It will, perhaps, be found on
the whole, that vanity and the love of power predominate; but I do not say it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> so,
for these qualities and a hundred others mingle into each other, and shift, and change,
and glance away, like the colours in a peacock's train. In some others of Shakespeare's
female characters, also remarkable for their complexity (Portia and Juliet, for instance),
we are struck with the delightful sense of harmony in the midst of contrast, so that
the idea of unity and simplicity of effect is produced in the midst of variety; but in
Cleopatra, it is the absence of unity and simplicity which strikes us; the impression
is that of perpetual and irreconcileable contrast. The continual approximation of
whatever is most opposite in character, in situation, in sentiment, would be fatiguing,
were it not so perfectly natural: the woman herself would be distracting, if she were
not so enchanting. I have not the slightest doubt that Shakespeare's Cleopatra is the
real historical Cleopatra&mdash;the &lsquo;Rare Egyptian&rsquo;&mdash;indivdualised and placed before us.
Her mental accomplishments, her unequalled grace, her woman's wit and woman's
wiles, her irresistible allurements, her starts of irregular grandeur, her bursts of
ungovernable temper, her vivacity of imagination, her petulant caprice, her fickleness
and her falsehood, her tenderness and her truth, her childish susceptibility to flattery,
her magnificent spirit, her royal pride, the gorgeous eastern colouring of the character; 
<pb n="501"/>
all these contradictory elements has Shakespeare seized, mingled them in their
extremes, and fused them into one brilliant impersonation of classical elegance, Oriental 
voluptuousness, and gipsy sorcery. What better proof can we have of the
individual truth of the character than the admission that Shakespeare's Cleopatra produces 
exactly the same effect on us that is recorded of the real Cleopatra? She
dazzles our faculties, perplexes our judgement, bewilders and bewitches our fancy
from the beginning to the end of the drama, we are conscious of a kind of fascination
against which our moral sense rebels, but from which there is no escape. The epithets 
applied to her perpetually by Antony and others confirm this impression:
&lsquo;enchanting queen!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;witch&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;spell&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;great fairy&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;cockatrice&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;serpent of
&lsquo;old Nile&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;thou grave charm&rsquo;&mdash;are only a few of them. . . . In representing the
mutual passion of Antony and Cleopatra as real and fervent, Shakespeare has adhered
to the truth of history as well as to general nature. On Antony's side it is a species
of infatuation, a single and engrossing feeling: it is, in short, the love of a man
declined in years for a woman very much younger than himself, and who has subjected 
him by every species of female enchantment. In Cleopatra the passion is of a
mixt nature, made up of real attachment, combined with the love of pleasure, the love
of power, and the love of self. Not only is the character most complicated, but no
one sentiment could have existed pure and unvarying in such a mind as hers; her
passion in itself is true, fixed to one centre; but like the pennon streaming from the
mast, it flutters and veers with every breath of her variable temper: yet in the midst
of all her caprices, follies, and even vices, womanly feeling is still predominant in
Cleopatra; and the change which takes place in her deportment towards Antony,
when their evil fortune darkens round them, is as beautiful and interesting in itself
as it is striking and natural. Instead of the airy caprice and provoking petulance
she displays in the first scenes, we have a mixture of tenderness, and artifice, and
fear, and submissive blandishment. Her behaviour, for instance, after the battle of
Actium, when she quails before the noble and tender rebuke of her lover, is partly
female subtlety and partly natural feeling.</p>
<p>The Cleopatra of Fletcher reminds us of the antique colossal statue of her in the
Vatican, all grandeur and grace. Cleopatra in Dryden's tragedy is like Guido's
dying Cleopatra in the Pitti Palace, tenderly beautiful. Shakespeare's Cleopatra is
like one of those graceful and fantastic pieces of antique Arabesque, in which all
anomalous shapes and impossible and wild combinations of form are woven together
in regular confusion and most harmonious discord: and such, we have reason to
believe, was the living woman herself, when she existed upon this earth.</p></quote></cit>

to love. They follow only their inborn nature; and if they do not wish to empty the
forbidden cup, they like at least to sip from it, or lick the brim, just to see what poison
tastes like. . . . Yes, this Cleopatra is a woman in the blessedest and cursedest sense
of the word! She reminds me of that saying of Lessing, &lsquo;When God made woman
&lsquo;He took too fine a clay!&rsquo; The extreme delicacy of His material seldom agrees
with the requirements of life. This creature is at once too good and too bad for this
world. Most charming attractions are here the cause of most repulsive frailties. With
enchanting truth Shakespeare depicts, even at the first appearance of Cleopatra, the
variegated fluttering spirit of caprice which is always rampant in the brain of the
beautiful queen, not seldom bubbling over in the most notable questions and desires,
<pb n="502"/>
and is perhaps really to be regarded as the final cause of all her actions and behaviour.
. . . From the excited, unbalanced mind of Cleopatra, made up of extremes shuffled
together, a mind oppressively sultry, there flashes, like heat-lightning, a sensuous,
wild, and brimstone-yellow wit, which frightens rather than pleases. Plutarch gives
us an idea of this wit, which shows itself more in deeds than words. . . .</p>
<p>The surroundings of Cleopatra are as intensely witty as her character. This
capricious, pleasure-seeking, ever-veering, feverishly coquettish woman, this antique
Parisienne, this goddess of life, scintillated and ruled over Egypt, the stark, silent
land of the dead. You know it well, that Egypt, that Mizraim full of mystery, that
Nile with its narrow valley, looking like a coffin. In the high reeds grins the crocodile, 
or the exposed babe of Revelation whimpers. Rock temples with colossal
pillars, whereon appear caricatures of sacred animals of horribly varied hues. At the
portal nods a monk of Isis, with hieroglyphic head-gear. In luxurious villas, mummies 
take their siestas, and the gilded masks protect them from the swarms of carrion
flies. There stand slender obelisks and squat pyramids, like dumb thoughts. In
the background we are greeted by the Ethiopian mountains of the Moon, hiding
the sources of the Nile. Everywhere Death, Stone, and Mystery. And over this
land, there ruled as queen the beautiful Cleopatra. How witty God is!</p></quote></cit>

for Antony is much inferior in depth, steadiness, and sincerity to his for her: but
this was required by the events of the history. However, Shakespeare has put some

and dazzling loveliness. Full of soul, full of power, and full of poetry, she is the
very majesty of voluptuousness; she could beat Antony himself in the strength and
endurance of carousal. &lsquo;O, times,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;I laughed him out of patience, and
&lsquo;that night I laughed him into patience, and next morning, ere the ninth hour, I
&lsquo;drunk him to his bed.&rsquo; Ambitious, yet sensuous; cunning, yet intellectual; insidious, 
yet bold; high and daring in her aims, she contrives to combine politics with
pleasure. Keen in her understanding, yet gorgeous in her imagination, she knew
how to conceal a plan within a pageant, and her pageantry was the pageantry of a
goddess. Vehement as she was subtle, her pleasures were as ocean-tides; they
surged up from the dark depths of her impassioned soul. Daughter of the Ptolemies,
queen of olden and mystic Egypt, with the rich genius of Greece and the hot blood
of Africa, she was at once poetess, sovereign, and enchantress; grace, mingled with
force, concealed the grossness of her excess; something of the artistic entered into
the wildest extravagance of her luxuries: even in her vices she was brilliant and
imperial. It was meet that her lovers should be masters of the world; with no lower
suitors would imagination be content to mate her. If <hi rend="italic">she</hi> must bend her sceptre to

magnificent Antony became a mere child to her command. What measure shall we
find for that combination of womanly witchery and womanly genius, the result of
which we observe in the subjugation of two such men as haughty Julius and inconstant 
Antony? It required the mind of Shakespeare properly to conceive it, and by
Shakespeare only it has sufficiency of expression.</p></quote></cit>

seemingly contradictory qualities are reconciled, and both the same paradoxical
grandeur compounded out of all that is most morally worthless. Fascination radiates 
equally from either personality, and as Falstaff, when completely bankrupt in
honour and fortune, is still the knight and the gentleman, so Cleopatra, guilty of the
most detestable and squalid forms of misconduct, remains every inch a queen. In
the Boar's Head Tavern and in the Palace at Alexandria a similar struggle is being
waged: the venue is changed, and the weapons, but an identical principle is at stake.
Falstaff had sought to defeat moral facts by the dazzling play of an inexhaustible
humour; Cleopatra substitutes the no less dazzling play of an inexhaustible personal
charm, wherein beauty, as Plutarch expressly states, was only a minor element. Perfect 
beauty could indeed scarcely be the portion of this &lsquo;gipsy,&rsquo; with &lsquo;Ph&oelig;bus&rsquo; amorous
&lsquo;pinches black,&rsquo; but she has the more talismanic gifts of perennial youth and
endless versatility of attraction. . . . Antony's names for her, &lsquo;serpent of old Nile,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;great fairy,&rsquo; testify to a spell that seems wellnigh more than human. Yet its
potency really springs from her unabashed revelation of a womanhood dowered with
every captivating attribute save those which have a moral source. The Cleopatra
of Shakspere, and indeed of Plutarch, anticipates a type of which the modern stage
is often supposed to be the originator. This <hi rend="italic">demi-mondaine</hi> born in the purple, with
her hot and cold fits, her mingled restlessness and languor, her passion at once false
and true, her lavishness and her avarice, her seductive wiles varied by outbursts of
ferocity or coarseness&mdash;what essential aspect of courtesan-nature has the realism of
today discovered which is not to be found in this wonderful picture? Fate provides
for a unique manifestation of the myriad possibilities of Cleopatra's character when
it throws Antony into her toils. In her youth she had been C&aelig;sar's paramour, but
to the conqueror and statesman this dalliance had been only an interlude amidst the
serious work of war and government. Antony is of other mould, and is, in fact, as
completely the masculine counterpart of Cleopatra as Benedick was of Beatrice. The
emotional homage which in earlier days he had lavished on C&aelig;sar is now poured
forth yet more unreservedly at the feet of the Egyptian Queen. In her, Antony finds
a being who satisfies the boundless craving of his richly endowed sensuous nature.
Yet this passion, so mutually enthralling, so opulent of delight, is not, in any true
<pb n="505"/>
sense, love. The souls of Antony and Cleopatra have never for one moment mingled.
The gorgeous fabric of their bliss totters from hour to hour on an unstable foundation.
Antony is always on the watch for treachery on the part of the &lsquo;gipsy,&rsquo; and Cleopatra
is ever fearful that her paramour will be drawn from her side by his bond as a husband,

Antony's poor dust might have tossed forgotten in the burning winds of Egypt. And
yet, I do not know,&mdash;who can know? That is precisely what gives the character its
charm. History leaves us in the same doubt. Shakespeare may have had no definite

compass of poetry, where her soft equanimity in the midst of grief is compared to
&lsquo;The swan's down feather That stands upon the swell at flood of tide, And neither
&lsquo;way inclines.&rsquo; The fear which seems to haunt the mind of Cleopatra, lest she
should be &lsquo;chastised by the sober eye&rsquo; of Octavia, is exceedingly characteristic of
the two women: it betrays the jealous pride of her, who was conscious that she had
forfeited all real claim to respect; and it places Octavia before us in all the majesty
of that virtue which could strike a kind of envying and remorseful awe even into the
bosom of Cleopatra. What would she have thought and felt, had some soothsayer
foretold to her the fate of her own children, whom she so tenderly loved? Captives,

&lsquo;his who gains the most by it.&rsquo; . . . He has often, like many other persons whose
whole wit consists in preserving a judicious silence, been taken for a deep thinker,
but his solemn and mysterious manner only hides the emptiness beneath. Nothing
is more irritating for purposes of analysis than this kind of colourless character, which
has nothing original or worth studying about it, and which defies all definition, because
its indefinite and varying features cannot possibly be brought into any sort of unity.
For instance, Octavius was cruel from inclination as well as from policy, and several
instances of his cruelty are related by Suetonius which Caligula himself might have
envied: but he had his moments of moderation and clemency notwithstanding, and
it is to one of these slight attacks of generosity that he owes the reputation of magnanimity 
which he has obtained through the too great benevolence of Corneille, who
was ever on the watch for what was grand and noble. The death of his enemy
Antony inspired him, according to Suetonius, with feelings of delight, but according
to Plutarch, he withdrew into his tent and wept and lamented. Shakespeare here,
as always, follows Plutarch; but his conduct is not of the slightest importance, nor
is it even necessary to suppose that his tears were hypocritical: with this thin coating
of sensitiveness he might easily be affected for an instant by the &lsquo;breaking of so great
&lsquo;a thing.&rsquo; A passive instrument in the hands of fortune, tame and colourless, without 
one ray of poetry in his nature, Octavius both in history and in Shakespeare is an
absolutely vapid and insipid personage. To take him as the representative of an
iron will, cold, patient, and certain of his aim, as some commentators have done,
and to contrast him with the lavish splendour of a brilliantly gifted nature, whirled
away by a fatal passion, like that of Antony, is assuredly to do him too much honour.
We meet with many practical men of action in Shakespeare's plays who are tolerably
worthy of forming a contrast to the more poetical but less sensible hero, such as
Fortinbras in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> Alcibiades in <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens,</hi> and Cassius in <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar;</hi>
but we may be allowed to doubt whether Octavius had any very real practical merit,
and whether the appearance he had of it was not entirely due to the egregious folly
<pb n="507"/>
and infatuation of his opponent, by force of contrast with which, the faintest signs
of ability or wisdom would become magnified. When Antony, after his defeat,
challenged Octavius to single combat, it was not necessary for him to be a wise man,
to shrug his shoulders at a challenge so obviously absurd,&mdash;not to be a hero was
quite sufficient. It was not Octavius, but the star of his destiny that won the battle
of Actium: Cleopatra took flight, her lover followed her, and Octavius, as usual,
had only to let the gods act for him. At most, he only fills in the tragedy the place
of the principal agent in Antony's predestined downfall.</p></quote></cit>

<div2 type="subsection" n="Cleopatre Captive, by Estienne Jodelle"><head><title><foreign lang="fr">Cleopatre Captive</foreign></title>, by <name>Estienne Jodelle</name></head>
<p>In 1552 there was published in France a drama called <ref targOrder="U" target="jodelle-1583"><hi rend="italic">Cleopatre Captive,</hi></ref> which
was the first tragedy to appear in the French language. It was written by <name type="authority">Estienne
Jodelle</name>, &lsquo;fieur du Lymodin,&rsquo; who was born in Paris in 1532, and died at the age
of forty-one in 1573, when Shakespeare was nine years old. In construction this
tragedy was modelled on the Drama of Seneca; in some respects it shows the influence 
of the Greek tragedians also,&mdash;the Chorus shares in the dialogue, which is rare,
I think, in Seneca, and, in the <hi rend="italic">Second Act,</hi> it is divided into Strophes and Antistrophes. 
Its <hi rend="italic">Dramatis Person&aelig;</hi> are as follows: The Shade of Antony, Cleopatra,
Eras, Charmium, Octavian C&aelig;sar, Agrippa, Proculeius, Chorus of Alexandrian
Women, Seleucus. The First Scene is laid in Purgatory, and consists of a soliloquy 
by the Shade of Antony who laments the sad fate brought on him by the
gods, through their jealousy of his greatness; he reviews his past life, and his fatal
infatuation for Cleopatra, whom he bitterly denounces. Purgatorial fires having
already had some effect, the Ghost laments his cruel treatment of his wife, Octavia,
and furthermore,

<cit><quote><l>I chased my tender children from my side</l>
<l>And warmed that murderous serpent in my bosom</l>
<l>Which coiled about me, and deceived my soul,</l>
<l>While pouring deadly venom o'er my life.
<note place="foot" anchored="yes">A recent writer (<hi rend="italic">Athen&aelig;um,</hi> 11 August, 1906), in speaking of blank verse,
says with truth, &lsquo;it is criminally easy to write it execrably, and almost impossible to
&lsquo;write it well.&rsquo; Here, and in the translations, in blank verse, from the French, German, 
and Italian of the following <hi rend="italic">Versions,</hi> I enact the criminal.</note></l></quote>
<bibl> <ref targOrder="U" target="jodelle-1583">&mdash;p. 110, recto.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>But he is resolved that he will not remain all alone in torment; before the sun,
now rising, sets, Cleopatra must die. He has appeared to her in a dream, and commanded 
her, after having given his corpse an honourable burial, to kill herself,

<cit><quote><l><foreign lang="fr">Or' se faisant compagne en ma peine et tristesse</foreign></l>
<l><foreign lang="fr">Qui s'est faite long temps compagne en ma liesse;</foreign></l></quote><bibl> <ref targOrder="U" target="jodelle-1583">&mdash;p. 110, verso.</ref></bibl></cit>

which has really a show of justice and fair play. In the next Scene Cleopatra
rehearses to Eras and Charmium, the events of her life, much in the same style as
Antony had narrated his past story, but, not having had as yet the advantage of
Purgatorial flames, her remorse is not so deep. She refers with terror to her dream,
and decides that Antony's commands must be obeyed; moreover, every horror is to
be endured rather than be taken to Rome for C&aelig;sar's triumph. The Chorus, at the
close of the <hi rend="italic">Act,</hi> shows a close imitation of Seneca by beginning with a description,
by no means without charm, of a sunrise and an opening day. It inevitably challenges 
comparison with the fine description by the Chorus at the end of the <hi rend="italic">First
Act</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Hercules Furens,</hi> beginning, &lsquo;Jam rara micant sidera prono Languida

<pb n="508"/>
&lsquo;mundo,&rsquo; etc. In the next <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> Octavius boasts to Agrippa and Proculeius of his
grandeur and of his mighty exploits, beginning with the self-complacent assertion
that no one under heaven's cope has been so favoured by the gods as he himself.
But his career will be incomplete if he cannot take Cleopatra in triumph to Rome.
Proculeius describes the manner in which he captured the queen, wherein Jodelle
closely follows Plutarch. Octavius bids him dispossess Cleopatra of all thoughts of
suicide. In the <hi rend="italic">Third Act</hi> there is a conference between Octavius and the Queen.
The latter displays the letters of Julius C&aelig;sar, wherefrom it appears that Jodelle consulted 
Dion Cassius as well as Plutarch. In Cleopatra's appeals, as a queen, for
compassion, in her lamentations for Antony, and in her despairing commiseration of
her own bitter lot, the drama rises, I think, to its highest point of tragedy. &lsquo;Unless,&rsquo;
Cleopatra, addressing Octavius, plaintively begins:

<cit><quote><l>Unless the grief, imprisoned in my breast,</l>
<l>Far, far surpassed this final plaint of mine</l>
<l>Thou wouldst not see thy poor slave at thy feet.</l>
<l>No words of mine are equal to the grief,</l>
<l>Which, throbbing, has consumed me all within,&mdash;</l>
<l>My tears, my moans, and all my heavy sighs.</l>
<l>Art thou surprised that this word &ldquo;separation&rdquo;</l>
<l>Has power to put my steadfastness to flight?</l>
<l>To separate! ye gods! I know its meaning!</l>
<l>If this sad war had only been foreseen,</l>
<l>It had been better for me, luckless queen,</l>
<l>To have separated from him during life.</l>
<l>His bitter grief could then have been prevented!</l>
<l>I could have warded off all cruel blows,</l>
<l>Because I had the means and chance, with hope</l>
<l>Of seeing in full secresy his face.</l>
<l>But now a hundred,&mdash;hundred-hundredfold</l>
<l>I've suffered from this bitter war; by it</l>
<l>I've lost my lands, my kingdom,&mdash;and my all!</l>
<l>And I have seen my life, and my support,</l>
<l>My joy, my universe, take his own life!</l>
<l>And, bleeding as he was, all cold and wan,</l>
<l>I strove to warm him with my own hot tears,</l>
<l>And almost separated myself from him</l>
<l>While death was separating him from me.</l>
<l>Ha Dieux, grands Dieux! Ha grands Dieux!</l>
<l>* * * * *</l>
<l>I needs must live; fear not I'll take my life.</l>
<l>I have not laid a scheme to kill myself.</l>
<l>But since 'tis right that I prolong my life</l>
<l>And that in me the love of life revive,</l>
<l>Vouchsafe to look upon this weakling, C&aelig;sar,</l>
<l>Who casts herself once more before thy feet.</l>
<l>At least, O C&aelig;sar, let my streaming tears</l>
<l>Induce a softness whence will spring my pardon.</l>
<l>Fast flowing drops will outwear e'en the flint,</l>
<l>Then on thy heart shall tears have no effect?</l></quote><bibl> <ref targOrder="U" target="jodelle-1583">&mdash;p. 223, recto.</ref></bibl></cit>

<pb n="509"/></p>
<p>In this one Scene there is, I think, a tragic human cry, deeper and more sincere
than is to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Cleopatras</hi> of many of Jodelle's successors who have
achieved more fame. Octavius remains, however, unmoved, and recounts all the
misdeeds in Cleopatra's career, but finally assures her that her life and the lives of
her children shall be spared. Out of gratitude the queen says that she will disclose
to Octavius all the gold and jewels in her treasury. Hereupon Seleucus comes forward 
officiously, as he does in Plutarch (in Shakespeare Cleopatra appeals to him),
and asserts that Cleopatra has concealed wealth incalculable. The Scene that follows 
in Plutarch, where Cleopatra falls into a rage with Seleucus, proved to Jodelle
too attractive to be omitted; consequently he inserted it at length, although so much
action is in general alien to the Senecan tragedy. By this one venturesome stroke
Jodelle has shown his appreciation of Cleopatra's nature, and has imparted action,
life, and character to his drama which give it a high place, earliest though it be of
French tragedies, when compared with those subsequently written under Senecan
influence, with Cleopatra for a theme. As Jodelle's <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> are very scarce (the first
edition appeared in 1552,&mdash;my copy is dated 1583), it may not be displeasing to
reprint this fragment of the Scene. Jodelle's close adherence to Plutarch can be
observed only in the original French; it would be lost in a translation. Seleucus has
finished his accusation and at once Cleopatra's anger breaks forth:

</p>
<p>Seleucus repents, and in a dialogue with the Chorus confesses that death would
be preferable to the memory which must be always his that he has so deeply wounded
and offended his queen and mistress.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Fourth Act</hi> is almost wholly given up to the bitter lamentations of Cleopatra.
At the close there are four lines which I think are touching:
<pb n="510"/>

<foreign lang="fr"><quote><l>Car entre tout le mal, peine, douleur, encombre,</l>
<l>Souspirs, regrets, soucis, que i' ay souffert sans nombre,</l>
<l>I' estime le plus grief ce bien petit de temps</l>
<l>Que de toy, &ocirc; Antoine, esloigner ie me sens.</l></quote></foreign>
</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Fifth Act</hi> is divided between Proculeius and the Chorus. The former, overwhelmed 
with grief, describes how he broke into the Monument and found Cleopatra 
and Eras dead and Charmium dying, without a trace of the cause of their death.
Later on, in wondering how he shall break the news to C&aelig;sar, he asks if it be possible 
that she could have died by an aspic's bite or by some secret poison. The
Chorus promises to the dead Cleopatra an eternity of fame in every land which the
sun beholds from his rosy dawn to his darkened rest.</p>
<p>Comparisons between national literatures are idle; therefore, after recalling the
fact that <hi rend="italic">Gorboduc,</hi> our earliest tragedy, was written in 1562, just ten years after
Jodelle's <hi rend="italic">Cleopatre,</hi> it seems to me a sufficient conclusion that the latter as a first essay
in dramatic tragedy is an origin of which any literature might be more than contented.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="subsection" n="M. Antoine, by Robert Garnier"><head><title>M. Antoine</title>, by <name>Robert Garnier</name></head>

<p>The next Tragedy, chronologically, wherein Cleopatra appears, is that by <name type="authority">Robert
Garnier</name>, <hi rend="italic">conseiller dv Roy lieutenant general criminel au siege presidial &amp; senechaussee 
du Maine.</hi> It is called <ref targOrder="U" target="garnier-1616"><hi rend="italic">M. Antoine,</hi></ref> and was published in 1578. It shared the
popularity of Garnier's other plays, which during the following century were reprinted
at the remarkable rate of an edition every two years.<note place="foot" anchored="yes">See the admirable <hi rend="italic">Reprint</hi> of the Countess of Pembroke's <hi rend="italic">Antonie,</hi> edited, with
an Introduction, by <name type="authority">Alice Luce</name> (of Boston, Massachusetts), Weimar, 1897, p. 32.</note> <hi rend="italic">M. Antoine</hi> had the honour
of being translated by the Countess of Pembroke, Sir Philip Sidney's sister, in 1592.
To us, Shakespeare students, this translation is of importance. Its date renders it
possible that it may have been read by Shakespeare. But if Shakespeare ever
looked into it, I think he read no further than to the end of the <hi rend="italic">Argument,</hi> where he
found the statement that Garnier had drawn his material from Plutarch,&mdash;an ample
notice that, in material for his play, the English dramatist could gain nothing from
the French.</p>
<p>Of course, Garnier took Seneca as his model, except that he apparently thought
that if one Chorus was good two would be better,&mdash;a luxury in which, I believe,
Seneca never indulged. Garnier has a Chorus of Egyptians and another of C&aelig;sar's
soldiers. Inasmuch as the title of the play is <hi rend="italic">M. Antoine,</hi> it will hardly suffice that
Antony should be, as in Jodelle's tragedy, a Shade, which after all may be a source of
regret. The living man appears only twice during the play. The <hi rend="italic">First Act,</hi> of over
two hundred and thirty lines, is one long lugubrious monologue by him, wherein
he exalts his own fame and prowess, bewails his unjust downfall, and denounces
Cleopatra's deceitful love and treachery. His second appearance is in the <hi rend="italic">Third
Act</hi> wherein, with Lucilius as an occasional interlocutor, he continues, in about the
same number of lines, the same mournful strain, but with an open confession that he
cannot emancipate himself from Cleopatra's thralldom. It is in the course of this
<hi rend="italic">Act</hi> that he betrays the recent reading of his Dante when he says:

<foreign lang="fr"><cit><quote><l>Car rien tant ne tourmente vn h&omacr;me en sa misere</l>
<l>Que se representer sa fortune prospere.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="garnier-1616">&mdash;p. 194, ed. 1616.</ref></bibl></cit></foreign>

With an honesty beyond praise he puts these lines in quotation marks. The same
honesty, I regret to say, is not shown by the First Chorus, in thus distinguishing the
following lines:

<pb n="511"/>

<foreign lang="fr"><cit><quote><l>Heureux qui iamais n'eut de vie</l>
<l>Ou que la mort d&eacute;s le berceau</l>
<l>Luy a, pitoyable, rauie,</l>
<l>L'emmaillottant dans le tombeau.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="garnier-1616">&mdash;p. 171.</ref></bibl></cit></foreign>

which recall the words of the Chorus: <foreign lang="greek">mh\ fu_nai to\n a(/ranta nika_| lo/gon</foreign>, etc. in the
<bibl><hi rend="italic">&OElig;dipus Coloneus</hi> of Sophocles, line 1225, <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi></bibl></p>
<p>From the very structure of the dramas formed on the Seneca model, it is vain to
expect any development of character beyond that which twenty-four hours may
effect. Cleopatra appears in two Scenes, and what she is in the former she is in the
latter,&mdash;a woman deeply in love with Antony, freely acknowledging that she entangled 
him in her snares (and a little proud of it), and completely heart-broken that
Antony should think she had been treacherous to him. In describing her flight at
Actium she utters two lines which remind us and merely remind us, of Shakespeare;
in referring to Antony's pursuit, she says that he was

<foreign lang="fr"><cit><quote><l>&lsquo;Oublieux de sa charge, &amp; comme si son ame</l>
<l>Eust est&eacute; attach&eacute;e &agrave; celle de sa Dame.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="garnier-1616">&mdash;p. 178.</ref></bibl></cit></foreign>
</p>
<p>The reason she gives for her flight and for her decision to be in these wars, was
her extreme jealousy, lest Antony should return to Octavia. See III, vii, 23, <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi></p>
<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Fourth Act</hi> Antony's death (described as in Plutarch), is narrated to C&aelig;sar
by Dercetas. The <hi rend="italic">Fifth Act</hi> is devoted to Cleopatra, who takes leave of her children,
and although continually asserting her intention to kill herself, we have no information 
as to when, or where, or how she at last fulfills it. The <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> begins as follows:

<cit><quote><sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> O cruel Fortune! O accurs'd disaster!</l>
<l>O noxious love! O torch abominable!</l>
<l>O ill-starred pleasures! O caitiff beauty!</l>
<l>O deadly grandeur, deadly majesty!</l>
<l>O hapless life! O pitiable queen!</l>
<l>O Antony, through <hi rend="italic">my</hi> fault, to be buried!</l>
<l>O heavens too malign! alas! all blows</l>
<l>And rancour of the gods are come upon us!</l>
<l>Ill-omened queen! O would that I had ne'er</l>

<l>I am a plague and poison to my dear ones!</l>
<l>I've lost the ancient sceptre of my fathers!</l>
<l>This kingdom I've enslaved to foreign laws,</l>
<l>And of their heritage deprived my children.</l>
<l>Yet this is nought, alas! all nought, compared</l>
<l>With loss of you, dear spouse [<hi rend="italic">Espoux</hi>], by me ensnared,</l>
<l>Of you, whom I misled, and then constrained</l>
<l>By bloody hand, to lie in mouldring tomb.</l>
<l>Of you whom I destroyed, of you, my dearest lord,</l>
<l>From whom I took all honour, empire, life!</l>
<l>O harmful woman! H&eacute;! can I live on,</l>
<l>Locked up within this grisly, haunted tomb?</l>
<l>Can I breathe on? and can, oh, can my soul</l>
<l>Continue, in such grief, within my body?</l>
<l>O Atropos, O Clotho, fatal spinners!</l>
<l>O Styx, O Phlegethon, infernal rivers!</l>

<pb n="512"/></p>
<p>Cleopatra confides her children to Euphronius, with the prayer that he will wander
with them over the face of the earth rather than suffer them to fall into C&aelig;sar's power.
She then takes leave of them, as follows:

<cit><quote><l>Who knows but that your hands, to which false Fate</l>
<l>Once gave the promise of the Latin sceptre,</l>
<l>Shall bear, instead of it, a crooked sheep-hook,</l>
<l>A mattock, or a goad, or guide the plough?</l>
<l>Then learn to suffer, children, and forget</l>
<l>The glory of your birth, and bend to fate.</l>
<l>Adieu, my babes [<hi rend="italic">enfan&ccedil;ons</hi>] adieu, my heart's oppressed</l>
<l>With pity, grief; already death has pierced me!</l>
<l>I cannot breathe! Adieu for evermore!</l>
<l>Your sire or me you'll never more behold.</l>
<l>Adieu, sweet care, adieu!</l>
<sp><speaker>Children.</speaker><l> Madame, adieu!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Hah! that voice kills me. Bons Dieux, I faint!</l>
<l>I can no more. I die.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Eras.</speaker><l> Madame, would you</l>
<l>Succumb to sorrow? alas, pray speak to us!</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Children.</speaker><l> We come.</l></sp></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="garnier-1616">&mdash;p. 222.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Charmion and Eras at last succeed in reviving the Queen. Thereupon all three
begin to bewail Antony, and continue so doing for seventy lines, during which Charmion 
is fearful lest their tears should give out, and suggests that they keep on crying
&lsquo;tant qu'aurons quelque humeur.&rsquo; At the end of the seventieth line occurs the following 
passage which I think noteworthy. It is Cleopatra who is speaking:

<cit><quote><l>By our true loves, I pray thee, Antony,</l>
<l>By our two hearts, once kindled with sweet flames,</l>
<l>Our holy marriage [<hi rend="italic">Par nostre saint Hymen</hi>] and the tender pity</l>
<l>For our small children, pledges of our love,</l>
<l>That to thine ears my mournful voice may fly</l>
<l>And that on Pluto's shore thou wilt escort me,</l>
<l>Thy wife, thy friend; hear thou, O Antony,</l>
<l>Where'er thou art these sobbing sighs of mine.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="garnier-1616">p. 224.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>It is not a little remarkable, I think, that in more than one of these early versions
Cleopatra refers to Antony as her husband. Here we find an open reference to
their &lsquo;holy marriage.&rsquo; No other version that I can recall has spoken thus explicitly.
Cleopatra continues:
<cit><quote><l>Till now, I've lived as was decreed by Fate,</l>
<l>I now have run my wing&eacute;d course of years;</l>
<l>I've flourish'd; and I've reign'd; I've taken vengeance</l>
<l>On that proud foe, who holds me still in scorn.</l>
<l>Happy, thrice-happy had it been for me</l>
<l>If never fleet of Rome had touch'd these shores!</l>
<l>And now of me a phantom great shall go</l>
<l>Beneath the world, to bury all my woe!</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="garnier-1616">p. 225.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Cleopatra here anticipates the line which Virgil, in the <hi rend="italic">Fourth Book</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">&AElig;neid,</hi>
will put into Dido's mouth, &lsquo;Et nunc magna mei sub terras ibit imago.&rsquo; The queen
continues in this strain for about twenty lines; among them are the following:
<pb n="513"/>

<quote><l>Le plus aigre tourment qu'en mon ame ie sente,</l>
<l>Est ce peu que ie suis de toy, mon c&oelig;ur, absente.</l></quote>

which show that she had been lately reading her Jodelle. She then concludes:

<quote><l>Since I no more can sprinkle him with tears,&mdash;</l>
<l>Ah woe, those founts in me are all drawn dry,&mdash;</l>
<l>What is there left, alas! but lavish kisses?</l>
<l>O fairest eyes, my light, then let me kiss you!</l>
<l>O brow, proud honour's seat! fair, warlike face!</l>
<l>O neck! O arms! O breast where death</l>
<l>Just now, black deed, has struck the murderous blow!</l>
<l>A thousand kisses, and yet thousands more,</l>
<l>Accept as my last duty to your fame.</l>
<l>And in such office let my nerveless frame</l>
<l>Breathe forth my soul and wither on thy breast.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>And this is all. With this line the Tragedy ends.</p>
<p>Cleopatra's character is not altogether colourless, but is as far removed as possible
from any Shakespearian glow. Her love is boundless, her self-reproach endless,
her self-abasement abysmal, her knowledge of mythology extensive, and, had we
not had some experience with Jodelle, we should consider her achievement in soliloquy 
phenomenal. After your spirit is once fairly broken, you can read on and
on with a tepid gentle excitement that is not unpleasing. The Choruses are always
lyric, with occasional passages of genuine poetry. In all the incidents of the play
Plutarch is closely followed, and at all times there is a subtle consciousness that you

<div2 type="subsection" n="M. Antoine, translated by Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke"><head><title>M. Antoine</title>, translated by <name>Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke</name></head>

<p>The familiar fact has been already mentioned that this tragedy of Garnier was
&lsquo;done into English&rsquo; by <name type="authority">Mary Sidney</name>, Countess of Pembroke. It was published in
1592. That it is &lsquo;done into English&rsquo; is true, but it is done into awkward English,
which well might merit a stronger adjective when we recall some of the finished
poetry of her brother, Philip. She sedulously maintains the ten syllables of an
iambic pentameter; but to do this, all customary order of words is at times violated.
In the following selection I think and I hope I have given the translation at its
best. Passages written in stichomythia are unusually difficult to translate. The original 
French is throughout (except in the Choruses) in rhymed Alexandrines. With
a few exceptions, her Ladyship uses rhyme only in the stichomythic passages. Charmian
and Eras are dissuading Cleopatra from suicide:

<div2 type="subsection" n="Cleopatra by Giraldi Cinthio"><head><title>Cleopatra</title> by <name>Giraldi Cinthio</name></head>
<p><name type="authority">Giraldi Cinthio</name>, in 1583, follows Garnier, chronologically. His <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi>
published in that year, I have not succeeded in obtaining. <name type="authority">Klein</name> (<hi rend="italic">Italienische
Dramen,</hi> V, 352), gives a short account of it, &lsquo;<quote>It is conceivable,</quote>&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;<quote>nay, possible, perhaps even not improbable, that Shakespeare was acquainted with it.</quote>&rsquo;
But the instances that Klein cites in confirmation are among those which Shakespeare 
derived from Plutarch, and are therefore necessarily common to both dramas.
<name type="authority">Moeller</name> (p. 12) gives a fuller account of Cinthio's <hi rend="italic">Tragedy,</hi> and proves Klein's
account to be erroneous in several particulars. But whether we accept Moeller's
abstract or Klein's, the latter's general conclusion bears truth on the face of it:
&lsquo;<quote>Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Anthony and Cleopatra</hi> in comparison with Cinthio's <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> is like
the barge of purple and gold on the river Cydnus, and a little paper boat which a
boy sails in a gutter.</quote>&rsquo;
</p></div2>
<div2 type="subsection" n="The Tragedie of Cleopatra, by Samuel Daniel"><head><title>The Tragedie of Cleopatra</title>, by <name>Samuel Daniel</name></head>
<p>In 1594 the excellent poet, <name type="authority">Samuel Daniel</name>, put forth a third edition of his
<hi rend="italic">Sonnets,</hi> addressed to the imaginary, or at least unknown, fair &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Delia,</hi>&rsquo; and in the
same volume appeared, for the first time, <ref targOrder="U" target="daniel-1594"><hi rend="italic">The Tragedie of Cleopatra.</hi></ref> Daniel's
poems were deservedly popular, and this <hi rend="italic">Tragedy</hi> appeared in the successive editions
of them, in 1599, 1601, 1605, 1607, and 1609; in 1611 the <hi rend="italic">Tragedy</hi> was issued in a
separate impression.
<note place="foot" anchored="yes">Daniel, <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> iii, 3, ed. Grosart.</note>
 So many successive editions imply a wide circle of readers,
and the supposition is not violent that in this circle Shakespeare was included. Were
it so, he would have found one of the very few dramas in the English language,
modeled throughout on the drama of Seneca, which, even in its severest form, still
has a power to charm.</p>
<p>As far as any dramatic aid is concerned, Shakespeare could have found none whatever 
in Daniel's <hi rend="italic">Tragedy.</hi> There is no action in it. The whole of the <hi rend="italic">First Act</hi> is
a soliloquy by Cleopatra. The <hi rend="italic">Second</hi> is a dialogue between C&aelig;sar and Proculeius.
The <hi rend="italic">Third</hi> is another between Philostratus and Arius, and so on. Not even does
Cleopatra's death take place on the stage; it is described by a trusted servant, the
same who had brought her the basket of figs wherein the aspics were concealed.
Whatever influence Daniel had on Shakespeare must be detected not in any action,
but in similarity of thought or expression; of this, with two or three possible exceptions, 
I can find no traces that are indubitable, or even worthy of serious consideration. 
Naturally there are passages from Plutarch, even following the very words,
which are common to both poets, but therein it is Plutarch, not Daniel, whom Shakespeare 
<pb n="515"/>
has followed. One of the exceptions to which I have alluded is where the
messenger, &lsquo;Nuntius,&rsquo; describes his interview with his mistress when he brought her
the basket of figs:

<cit><quote><l>Well, in I went, where brighter than the Sunne,</l>
<l>Glittering in all her pompeous rich aray,</l>
<l>Great <name>Cleopatra</name> sate, as if sh' had wonne</l>
<l><name>C&aelig;sar,</name> and all the world beside, this day:</l>
<l>Euen as she was when on thy cristall streames,</l>
<l>Cleare <name>Cydnos,</name> she did shew what earth could shew; . . .</l>
<l>Euen as she went at first to meete her loue,</l>
<l>So goes she now againe to finde him.</l>
<l>But that first, did her greatnes onely proue,</l>
<l>This last her loue, that could not liue behind him.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="daniel-1594">&mdash;p. 84.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Thus Shakespeare's Cleopatra says,

<cit><quote><l>Shew me, my women, like a queen; go fetch</l>
<l>My best attires. I am again for Cydnus</l>
<l>To meet Mark Anthony.</l></quote><bibl n="shak. ant 5.2">&mdash;V, ii, 274.</bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Again Daniel's Cleopatra speaks of herself as Anthony's wife. She is addressing 
the spirit of the dead Anthony to intercede for her with the gods, and thus
adjures him,

<cit><quote><l>O worke they may their gracious helpe impart,</l>
<l>To saue thy wofull wife from such disgrace.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="daniel-1594">&mdash;p. 73.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Again there is a faint fleeting similarity in the two following passages. Thus
Daniel's Cleopatra:

<cit><quote><l part="F">now am I taught</l>
<l>In death to loue, in life that knew not how.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="daniel-1594">&mdash;p. 38.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Thus Shakespeare's:

<cit><quote><l>My desolation does begin to make</l>
<l>A better life.</l></quote><bibl>&mdash;V, ii, 2.</bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Daniel's Cleopatra calls Anthony <cit><quote>My Atlas.</quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="daniel-1594">&mdash;p. 32</ref></bibl></cit>; Shakespeare's calls him
<cit><quote>The demi-Atlas of this earth.</quote><bibl n="shak. ant 1.5">&mdash;I, v, 28.</bibl></cit></p>
<p>There is a certain passage in Shakespeare's play which has given rise to some
discussion on the score of its meaning. It is where Anthony moralises on the death
of Fulvia and says: <cit><quote><l>The present pleasure, By revolution lowering, does become</l>
<l>The opposite of itself.</l></quote><bibl n="shak. ant 1.2">&mdash;I, ii, 145</bibl></cit>. Can it be that this is a condensation of the
following lines in Daniel which were hovering in Shakespeare's memory?

<cit><quote><l>Thus doth the euer-changing course of things</l>
<l>Runne a perpetuall circle, euer turning:</l>
<l>And that same day that hiest glory brings,</l>
<l>Brings vs vnto the point of backe-returning.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="daniel-1594">p. 52.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>And I think these are all. That Shakespeare had read Daniel's <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> is of
course possible; that it is even probable, is not impossible; but that he was indebted
to it, or was influenced by it, in the faintest degree, in the delineation of any of his
characters, is, I think, chimerical.</p>
<p>Daniel published in 1599, among his Poems, <hi rend="italic">A Letter from Octauia to Marcus
Antonius,</hi> which is, to me, unattractive and lacking in earnestness, and with no trace
whatsoever of any influence on Shakespeare.

<pb n="516"/>
<p>I have deemed it beyond the scope of a study of the present play to set forth any
dramatisation of Cleopatra's story, wherein the scene is laid before the period when
Antony fell in love with her. Accordingly, no notice is here taken of the <hi rend="italic">Mort de

False One;</hi> nor, in our own day, of <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar and Cleopatra</hi> by Mr <name type="authority">Bernard Shaw</name>.</p>
<p>An exception is to be made, however, in favour of <ref targOrder="U" target="bf-1844"><hi rend="italic">The False One.</hi></ref> Scarcely has
there appeared in recent years an annotated edition of Shakespeare that does not
contain a reference to it in connection with <hi rend="italic">Anthony and Cleopatra.</hi> It was written
about 1620; it seems to be pretty generally conceded that Massinger wrote the
<hi rend="italic">First</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fifth Acts</hi> and Fletcher the rest. Why it should take its title from a
thoroughly repulsive character, a man utterly false and devoid of any moral principle, 
who killed his benefactor, Pompey, and is not the hero of the piece, it is not
easy to imagine. The play deals with Julius C&aelig;sar and his subjection to the
charms of Cleopatra. The story, briefly told and omitting all reference to &lsquo;the
false one,&rsquo; is that C&aelig;sar, in pursuit of Pompey after the battle of Pharsalia,
reaches Egypt, and there finds that Ptolemy, to make himself more secure as monarch 
on the throne, has &lsquo;committed to safe custody&rsquo; his sister, Cleopatra, who
by law was his equal in the government. When Cleopatra learns that C&aelig;sar is at
hand, she resolves to win him to espouse her cause against her brother. How she
was by stealth conveyed to his tent, concealed in a mattress, is a well-worn story,
together with the consequent subjection of C&aelig;sar to her fascinations. In order to
impress C&aelig;sar with a knowledge of Egypt's boundless resources, Ptolemy foolishly
attempts to dazzle his Roman guest by a display of wealth. This occurs in <hi rend="italic">Act III,</hi>
Scene iv, as follows: C&aelig;sar, Antony, and others enter on the upper stage, Cleopatra
appears, and Antony cries, &lsquo;The young queen comes: give room!&rsquo; C&aelig;sar responds,
&lsquo;Welcome, my dearest; Come, bless my side.&rsquo; Then Ptolemy and his courtiers
enter, also on the upper stage.
<quote><sp><speaker>Ptolemy.</speaker><l> Hail to great C&aelig;sar!</l>

<l>With wealthy Egypt's store, and then thy palate,</l>

</p>
<p>This fragment is given that it may fitly introduce the following Scene which is, I
think, the finest in the play:
<text n="play" lang="en"><body>
<head>Act IV, Scene ii. The Apartments of Cleopatra in the Palace.</head>
<stage>Enter Cleopatra, Arsinoe [her sister], and Eros [her maid].</stage>
<sp><speaker>Ars.</speaker><l> You are so impatient!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleo.</speaker><l> Have I not cause?</l>
<l>Women of common beauties and low births,</l>
<l>When they are slighted, are allow'd their angers:</l>
<l>Why should not I, a princess, make him know</l>
<l>The baseness of his usage?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ars.</speaker><l> Yes, 'tis fit:</l>
<l>But then again you know what man&mdash;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleo.</speaker><l> He is no man;</l>
<l>The shadow of a greatness hangs upon him,</l>
<l>And not the virtue: he is no conqueror;</l>
<l>H'as suffer'd under the base dross of nature;</l>
<l>Poorly deliver'd up his power to wealth,</l>
<l>The god of bed-rid men, taught his eyes treason;</l>
<l>Against the truth of love he has rais'd rebellion,</l>

<l>Some shadow of dislike: but to prefer</l>
<l>The lustre of a little earth, Arsinoe,</l>
<l>And the poor glow-worm light of some faint jewels,</l>
<l>Before the life of love and soul of beauty,</l>
<l>Oh, how it vexes me! He is no soldier;</l>
<l>All honourable soldiers are Love's servants:</l>
<l>He is a merchant, a mere wandering merchant,</l>
<l>Servile to gain; he trades for poor commodities,</l>
<l>And makes his conquests thefts. Some fortunate captains</l>
<l>That quarter with him, and are truly valiant,</l>
<l>Have flung the name of Happy C&aelig;sar on him;</l>
<l>Himself ne'er won it: he is so base and covetous,</l>
<l>He'll sell his sword for gold.

<l>And let him brag how poorly I am rewarded;</l>
<l>Let him go conquer still weak wretched ladies:</l>

<l>And, when he finds scorn, arm&egrave;d at the strongest.</l>
<l>I am a fool to fret thus for a fool,</l>
<l>An old blind fool too; I lose my health: I will not,</l>
<l>I will not cry; I will not honour him</l>

</p>
<p>From now till the end of the play C&aelig;sar's thoughts and acts are devoted to
extricating himself from the dangers of an insurrection of the Alexandrians, who
have besieged the Palace and threatened death to all its inmates. C&aelig;sar and a few
of his friends succeed in cutting their way to his ships. Ptolemy attempts to follow,
fails, and is cut down and trampled to death. C&aelig;sar returns with his legions, puts
down the insurrection, and, in the last Scene, enters the presence of Cleopatra with
<pb n="521"/>
the heads of her two greatest enemies. His last words recur to the close of the
Scene, given above. &lsquo;And now, my dearest,&rsquo; he says as he turns to Cleopatra,
<quote><l>Look upon C&aelig;sar, as he still appear'd [qu. <hi rend="italic">appears?</hi>]</l>
<l>A conqueror; and, this unfortunate king</l>
<l>Entomb'd with honour, we'll to Rome, where C&aelig;sar</l>
<l>Will show he can give kingdoms; for the Senate,</l>
<l>Thy brother dead, shall willingly decree</l>
<l>The crown of Egypt, that was his, to thee. <stage>[Exeunt.&rsquo;</stage></l>
</quote></p>
<p>It remains only to add that here and there, throughout the play, we hear Shakespearian 
echoes, such as where Cleopatra says, &lsquo;and for thy news Receive a favour
&lsquo;kings have kneeled in vain for, And kiss my hand.&rsquo;&mdash;I, ii; again Sc&aelig;va thus
describes Cleopatra, &lsquo;She will be sick, well, sullen Merry, coy, over-joy'd, and seem
&lsquo;to die, All in one half-an-hour.&rsquo; Again, in the foregoing extract, where Cleopatra
says, &lsquo;Had I been old, Or blasted in my bud,&rsquo; there is an echo of Constance's lament
for Arthur in <title>King John.</title>

Citoyen <name type="authority">Morgues</name>, who is saved by it from being at the very bottom of the list. In
the <hi rend="italic">First Act</hi> we learn of the dissatisfaction among Antony's generals in Alexandria, 
caused by the lavish way in which Antony bestows provinces on Cleopatra.
There is also a feast given by Cleopatra, who entreats her guests to be &lsquo;freely merry,&rsquo;
which must have been &lsquo;a sweating labour,&rsquo; if the following &lsquo;Song,&rsquo; introduced without 
prelude in the midst of the feast, indicates the height of revelry:

</p>
<p>Antony thus describes Cleopatra's appearance on the Cydnus:
<quote><l>And down the silver stream of <hi rend="italic">Cydnus,</hi> thou</l>
<l>In <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi> shape cam'st sayling, while the aire</l>

<pb n="522"/></p>
<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Second Act</hi> Antony and his generals decide upon a war with C&aelig;sar, and,
after a prolonged discussion, it is also decided that Cleopatra shall personally share
the fight. The <hi rend="italic">Third Act</hi> is in C&aelig;sar's camp. Antony's defeat at Actium is described,
and his seclusion in the island of Pharos is reported. C&aelig;sar receives a letter of submission 
from Cleopatra, laying her crown and kingdom at his feet. He decides to
send Thyreus to woo her in his name. &lsquo;Tell her&rsquo; he instructs Thyreus, &lsquo;that I love
&lsquo;her, and extremely dote On her admired beauty, and win her to betray Antonius to
&lsquo;my hand.&rsquo; The scene shifts to the island of Pharos, and Antony appears &lsquo;disguised
&lsquo;like Timon,&rsquo; and in this character holds a long and weak conversation with one of
his friends. A message from Cleopatra is delivered to him, begging him to return
to Alexandria and to her. Another friend announces to him that all the remnant of
his army is gone over to C&aelig;sar. Whereupon there ensues the following conversation, 
and the <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> ends:

<quote><sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Ha!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Lucilius.</speaker><l> This sinks into him.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Canidius.</speaker><l> It makes a deep impression in his passion.</l></sp>

<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> All you here yet! then I have friends I see.</l>
<l>But tell me, can you be so mercifull.</l>
<l>As to forgive that most unmanly fit</l>
<l>That I have been in? oh, I am all in blushes.</l></sp>

</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Fourth Act</hi> opens with Cleopatra's experiment as to the efficacy of an aspic's
bite. A prisoner already condemned to death is subjected to the trial and dies
instantly and painlessly. Whereupon the queen exclaims: &lsquo;I am resolv'd; nought
but the Libyan aspe Shall be renown'd for <hi rend="italic">Cleopatraes</hi> death.&rsquo; Thyreus enters and
in C&aelig;sar's name makes ardent love to Cleopatra and finally presents to her &lsquo;His
true, and most unflatter'd portraiture.&rsquo; Cleopatra waxes ecstatic over the portrait.
&lsquo;The fairest form,&rsquo; she cries, &lsquo;that ere these eyes beheld.
<quote><l>Where all the best of each best modell meets,</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Cupid's</hi> sweet smiles, lodg'd in the eye of <hi rend="italic">Mars,</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Ganymed's</hi> cheek, th' Imperiall brow of <hi rend="italic">Jove</hi></l>
<l>Where love and majesty are proud to dwell.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>She tells Thyreus that she will give him an answer shortly, and requests him in
the meantime to remain near her. He departs and Antony enters, who exclaims,
&lsquo;Ah sweetest Cleopatra, In this Ambrosiake kisse I am again possest of all my
&lsquo;wealth.&rsquo; Cleopatra responds to his warmth and says, &lsquo;Let's in and feast,&rsquo; and they
depart to that end. The feast is supposed to have taken place; the Queen resumes
her interview with Thyreus, and promises to surrender Pelusium to him. As for
Antony, he &lsquo;is already,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;fallen So low, that nothing can redeem him now&rsquo;
. . . &lsquo;he has lost the strength of his own soul, and is not That Antony he was when
&lsquo;first I knew him.&rsquo; Antony himself interrupts the conference, and in a mild explosion 
of jealousy orders Thyreus to prison. Cleopatra intercedes, amid protestations
<pb n="523"/>
of unalterable love, and at last threatens to resort to &lsquo;the lovely aspe&rsquo; which she has
kept to save her from C&aelig;sar, but will now apply against a &lsquo;worst fo,&rsquo;&mdash;Antonius's
baseness. Antony relents, apologises, and orders Thyreus to be released. In the
<hi rend="italic">Fifth Act</hi> C&aelig;sar and Cleopatra have an interview; the latter throws upon Fate the
guilt of her past actions, and C&aelig;sar bids her still live in all her regal state, and whispers 
directions to Epaphroditus in reference to it. Whereat Cleopatra, <hi rend="italic">aside:</hi>
<quote><l>Yes, whisper on; you cannot over-reach</l>
<l>My jealousies: no signes of love at all,</l>
<l>No smile, nor amorous glance; I was deceiv'd,</l>
<l>And meerly coosen'd by base Thyreus.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>As a result of the interview, C&aelig;sar, extremely forehanded, provides two &lsquo;Psyls,&rsquo;
as <name type="authority">May</name> calls them, to &lsquo;suck the mortall venome&rsquo; from Cleopatra in case she should
die by an asp. Cleopatra writes to C&aelig;sar informing him that by the time he receives
the note she will be no more, and then speaks, as follows:
<quote><l>So now my trouble is remov'd, I come,</l>
<l>I come my dearest Lord <hi rend="italic">Antonius,</hi></l>
<l>Never till now thy true and faithfull love.</l>
<l>My much abused Lord, do not disdain</l>
<l>Or blush t'acknowledge <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra'</hi>s name</l>
<l>When tears and bloud have wash'd her spotted soul.</l>
<l>Wert thou alive again, not all the world</l>
<l>Should shake my constancie, or make divorce</l>
<l>Twixt thee and mee; but since too late, alas,</l>
<l>My tears of sorrow come, I'll follow thee,</l>
<l>And beg thy pardon in the other world. . . .</l>
<l>Though false to thee alive, I now am come</l>
<l>A faithfull lover of thy dust and tombe.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>When we next see her, she is crowned and &lsquo;takes her state&rsquo;; Antony's hearse is
brought in.
<quote><l>This,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;is my second Coronation day;</l>
<l>But nobler then the first, and fuller farre</l>
<l>Of reall honour, and magnificence.</l>
<l>Nor till this pompous houre was <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi></l>
<l>A perfect Queen.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>When Charmion reminds her that Antony is dead, Cleopatra denies it, and says
that he still lives in the other world and is awaiting her, and from that seat of state
she will look down on Rome and C&aelig;sar's threats. Then addressing Antony's hearse,
her last words are,
<quote><l>Farewell thou fading remnant of my Love.</l>
<l>When I am gone, I'll leave these earthly parts</l>
<l>To keep thee company: never to part,</l>
<l>But dwell together, and dissolve together.</l>
<l>Come Aspe, possesse thy mansion; freely feed</l>
<l>On these two hills, upon whose snowy tops</l>
<l>The winged <hi rend="italic">Cupid</hi> oft has taken stand,</l>
<l>And shot from thence the proudest hearts on earth.</l>
<l>Corruption now, and rottennesse must seize</l>
<l>This once admired fabrick, and dissolve</l>
<l>This flesh to common elements again.
<pb n="524"/></l>
<l>When skilfull nature, were she strictly bound</l>
<l>To search through all her store-house would be pos'd</l>
<l>To tell which piece was <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> once.</l>
<l>Sweet Aspe, I feel thy touch, and life begins</l>
<l>From these cold limbs to take her gentle flight.</l>
<l>A slumber seizes me; farewell my girles.</l>
<l>Thus let the Romans find me dead, and know</l>
<l>Maugre the power of Rome, and C&aelig;sar's spleen</l>
<l>That <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> liv'd, and di'd a Queen.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>&lsquo;She's dead, and <hi rend="italic">Eira</hi> too,&rsquo; says Charmion, who thereupon stabs herself. C&aelig;sar
enters. The &lsquo;skilfull Psyls&rsquo; exert their art in vain.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="subsection" n="Cleopatra, by Giovanni Delfino"><head><title>Cleopatra</title>, by <name>Giovanni Delfino</name></head>
<p><name type="authority">Giovanni Delfino</name> was born in Venice in 1617, was made a Cardinal in 1667,
and died in 1699. In his youth he wrote beside philosophical essays, several tragedies 
which were collected by his nephew and sumptuously printed in Padua in
1733. Among these tragedies the most celebrated was, and is, <ref targOrder="U" target="delfino-1733"><hi rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi></ref> written
in 1660. In its first Scene the Shade of Antony, in Avernus, implores the aid of
Megaera, one of the Eumenides. He asserts that his love for Cleopatra is still as
deep as ever and his only dread is that Augustus C&aelig;sar will woo and win her; this,
he begs Megaera to prevent, and the Fury promises that she will thwart all the joys
of Augustus in that direction. In the next Scene Augustus (somewhat prematurely
so called), in an interview with Cleopatra, endeavours to calm the queen's mind by
expatiating on the instability of human affairs, and bids her not despair,
<quote><l>The heavens do not always keep one face;</l>
<l>The stars wherefrom proceed all joy and woe,</l>
<l>Are wheels and are for ever turning.</l>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Fortune, in sooth, has fought with me and won,</l>
<l>The stars indeed have had their fullest triumph.</l>
<l>One comfort now alone remains to me,&mdash;</l>
<l>O'er which nor fate nor stars have any power,&mdash;</l>
<l>A heart it is, that welcomes speedy death,</l>
<l>And, conquering fortune, triumphs over fate.</l></sp></quote>
</p>
<p>Augustus, who is as faultless in gentleness and devotion to Cleopatra as the most
enamoured of lovers, tries in every way to dissuade her from her fell purpose, even
promising that she shall not be led in triumph at Rome, and at last so far prevails
that she promises that she will not carry out her design without listening once more
to his counsels,&mdash;but she exacts the condition that he will not prevent her from
taking her own life when she has finally resolved to do so. Cleopatra afterwards
confides to her maid, Ergonda, that she mistrusts Augustus and believes that all his
promises are merely wiles to entrap her. Ergonda, who supplies the place of Charmian 
and Iras in other versions, and is at times tediously didactic and philosophical,
maintains that Augustus is genuinely in love with her mistress, and tries to dispel
Cleopatra's devotion to the memory of Antony by saying that earthly affairs no
longer interest the dead, and quotes her father, a most learned man, as saying that
our souls when freed from the body become a part of that great soul whose eternal
source is the wandering sun, and that when emancipated from the body, our souls
have no human thoughts, but are interested solely in the other world. She exhorts
Cleopatra, therefore, to sustain life and throne at all hazards. Cleopatra is unmoved
and replies sadly,
<pb n="525"/>
<quote><l>For life and throne I have no further care;</l>
<l>From every human wish my heart is free.</l>
<l>I have lived and I have reigned.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>With the exception of a short Scene, in which an astrologer, Sesastre by name, is
puzzled in reading Cleopatra's stars which foretell a marriage and a death within an
hour, the rest of the <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> is taken up by Agrippa with the description of a storm at
sea, and by Augustus with a full account of Antony's death and of the seizure, as
prisoner, of Cleopatra, wherein throughout <name type="authority">Delfino</name> follows Plutarch. The Chorus
which closes each <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> here denounces navigation, which offers facilities for rich and
powerful nations to approach and conquer other countries as the Romans have conquered 
Egypt. We next learn from Ergonda that Cleopatra, overborne by the representations 
of the astrologer and the arguments of Ergonda herself, has consented to
look with favour on Augustus's love if it be offered voluntarily, and has instructed
Ergonda to sound the Emperor on the subject. But the maid is timid and decides
that it is better to entrust the delicate matter to an erudite priest, Acoreo. In the
next Scene Augustus describes to Agrippa how his pity for Cleopatra has developed
into love; to console her in her bitter lot he visited her more than once and became
dazzled by her beauty; the sovereignty which had fallen from her hand she still bore
on her brow; when she spoke every word was a fetter and every glance of her
eye a snare. Thus he became the prisoner of his prisoner. Agrippa sympathises
with his royal master and advises him secretly to marry the queen, who would then
be willing to go to Rome, under the temporary guise of a prisoner; she would be
not the conquered, but, in reality, the conqueror. This, however, is too great a gift
to be proffered. Cleopatra must be induced to ask for it. This delicate service
Agrippa undertakes, but in the course of prolonged self-communings he decides
that he had better entrust the extremely delicate affair to the more skilful hands of
the learned priest, Acoreo. In the meantime Ergonda had sought out this same
Acoreo and begged him to elicit with all possible caution the nature of the sentiments 
of C&aelig;sar toward Cleopatra. This Acoreo consents to do to the extent of his
ability. An interview between Agrippa and Acoreo follows wherein after a vast
deal of circumlocution, the project of a marriage between Augustus and Cleopatra is
broached and Acoreo is made a plenipotentiary in the premises. The Chorus sings
its little song over the power of Fortune and the <hi rend="italic">Second Act</hi> closes. In the next <hi rend="italic">Act</hi>
we listen to the ecstatic rhapsodies of Augustus over the loveliness of Cleopatra;
we hear of a fearful dream of his, wherein he sees Death break Cupid's bow, while
exclaiming &lsquo;Cleopatra is mine.&rsquo; Acoreo tries, in vain, to persuade the queen that
C&aelig;sar's love for her is true; she refuses to believe it and sends word that she is
determined to die that very day. In his profound despair at hearing this, Augustus
empowers Agrippa to offer immediate marriage to the queen, but that it must be kept
secret until their arrival in Rome. In the next <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> Cleopatra's scruples yield to the
persuasion of Acoreo, and when Agrippa enters and delivers the message from
Augustus he finds her acquiescent. As her last words to him, she declares,

<cit><quote><l>When in Augustus I behold such power</l>
<l>United with such goodness, I am forced</l>
<l>To question if there be not hither come</l>
<l>Some god to dwell with us awhile on earth.</l>
<l>Already with his host he's conquered Egypt,</l>
<l>But by this noble offer he has made</l>
<l>He has conquered even Cleopatra.
<pb n="526"/></l>
<l>I can deny him nothing more. For me</l>
<l>His slightest wish shall be my highest law.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="delfino-1733">&mdash;p. 114.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>When alone, Cleopatra indulges in delicious day-dreams of her power in Rome,
and of her exultation at the sight of proud Roman matrons kissing the ground before
her. Her thoughts, however, revert to Antony, and she exclaims,
<quote><l>Believe me, ah believe, thou Shade adored!</l>
<l>Could tears recall thee to the vital air</l>
<l>Into twin founts my eyes at once should turn.</l></quote>

Then she reflects that if tears and grief could recall the dead to life, death would
not be death; she must submit to nature, and time must bring her consolation, but
<quote><l>O Shade revered and loved, here now I swear</l>
<l>Thine image never shall depart this heart!</l>
<l>Whate'er my lot, or 'neath whatever clime</l>
<l>Thy memory shall be noblest and most dear!</l></quote>
</p>
<p>Augustus also has his hour of exultation and exaltation, and needs over a hundred
lines wherein to express his enraptured emotions. Agrippa enters, and, recognising
the embarrassment that would arise should it become known in Rome that Augustus
was about to marry Rome's bitter foe before Augustus himself could reach that city
and control the situation, advises his royal master to dispatch a letter to the Senate
warning the Senators to disbelieve any such report, and that in a few days he would
bring Cleopatra as a captive in chains to Rome, etc. Augustus approves of the plan.
The letter is written, but in quelling a disturbance at the harbour, Agrippa loses it.
It was found and brought to Cleopatra, who opened it and there read, as she naturally 
believed, an incontrovertible proof of Augustus's treachery. Her grief, horror,
and misery are extreme, but her duty is now clear before her,&mdash;she must at once
rejoin Antony and prepare for the fatal voyage in Charon's boat. She writes a note:
&lsquo;From Cleopatra already enrolled in the Book of the Dead, to the inhuman Augustus.
If thy wrath at my death be over, be silent concerning the base secret [that she had
been faithless for a while to Antony's memory] which I carry to the tomb and to
the Tartarean strand,&rsquo; etc. This note she entrusts to Ergonda, who delivers it to
Augustus with bitter reproaches. Augustus is plunged into the deepest despair, and
to his lamentations Ergonda responds, &lsquo;Thus,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;a coccodrill [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] weeps
when he has killed a man.&rsquo; She tells how Cleopatra, with Augustus's letter to the
Senate in her hand, had gone into her garden, and, seeking some means whereby to
end life quickly, her eyes lit on a vase of flowers wherein she caught sight of two
aspics, which, in spite of Ergonda's struggles with her, she had succeeded in applying 
to her breast; the deadly poison conquered the fortress of her heart, and she
fell to the ground like a lovely purple flower cut down by the ploughshare. Augustus
lifts up his voice in bitter, heart-rending lamentations. The Chorus announces, however, 
that Cleopatra is not yet dead, that Acoreo had found her, explained everything,
and that now she wishes to see Augustus before the last sigh escapes from her dying
breast. Augustus hastens to her side. She tells him that her feet already stand on
board the fatal skiff. Awful as is the approach of death, more awful still is the
thought of her great unfaithfulness to Antony's memory. &lsquo;It is not right,&rsquo; she says
to Augustus,
<quote><l>That it should grieve you thus,</l>
<l>Because the Fates have taken from my heart</l>
<l>The noble gift which you so lately made.</l>
<l>She is not worthy of your priceless love,
<pb n="527"/></l>
<l>Who, tempted by desire or empty pride,</l>
<l>Could prove a traitress to that noble Shade!</l>
<l>Bestow no grief, I pray, where none is due.</l>
<l>A faithless heart deserves not C&aelig;sar's tears.</l>
<l>Ah woe! ah woe! I feel the fatal shears</l>
<l>Which slit the thin-spun thread of waning life.</l>
<l>Ador&eacute;d Shade, if thou still hover near,</l>
<l>Do not disdain to list the earnest prayer</l>
<l>Of penitence sincere, and tend on me,</l>
<l>While forth I fare toward that nighted shore;</l>
<l>And on that horrid path, shield thou thy Cleopatra. . . .</l>
<l>My life, Augustus, lingers only now</l>
<l>Upon the cool edge of my dying lips,</l>
<l>A sigh, and it is gone for ever.</l>
<l>Lo, Destiny, thou hast conquered!</l>
<l>Farewell, my country,&mdash;friends, farewell! <stage>[Dies.&rsquo;</stage></l>

<p><emph>Germany</emph> was the last among European nations to awaken to the charm of dramatic 
tragedy. There are rival claimants to the honour of being the first to set forth
this charm, but it is, I believe, now generally conceded that this honour belongs to
<name type="authority">Daniel Casper von Lohenstein</name>, who, in 1660, produced <ref targOrder="U" target="lohenstein-1661"><hi rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi></ref> &lsquo;the first

Few dramatists have experienced more
deeply than <name type="authority">Casper</name> the alternations of popularity and neglect; extolled in his own
day, and for long years afterward, as the greatest of dramatic poets, surpassing
Greeks, Romans, and French (I believe the comparison never extended to Shakespeare), 
his fame dwindled, until in recent times &lsquo;Lohensteinian bombast&rsquo; became
a term of reproach. The estimation in which he is held at the present day seems to
be more moderate and more just,&mdash;whatever excellences he shows are his own, and
his defects, which are many, are the limitations of a pioneer in a new field. His
tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> extends to four thousand two hundred and thirty-five lines
(the lines are numbered,&mdash;I should never have had the patience to count them) of
rhymed Alexandrines. <name type="authority">Gen&eacute;e</name> suggests (p. 49) that <name type="authority">Casper</name> did not consider the
Drama in connection with the stage, but as a department of literature. This suggestion 
is, I think, to be charitably accepted.</p>
<p>The drama begins after the battle of Actium. Antony has repulsed an attack of
Roman cavalry, but is deserted by his soldiers, contemplates suicide, thinks better
of it, calls a council of war, in course of which he explains that the defeat at Actium
was due to Fate, who attacked him &lsquo;tooth and nail,&rsquo; and discharged from heaven on
him lightning, hail, rain, thunderbolts, turning sails inside out, entangling the ropes,
unshipping masts and rudders. Wherefore, no one could blame Cleopatra for leading 
the way to safety out of this sulphurous hell (line 105)&mdash;an apology for Cleopatra's 
flight which is, I think, unusual. The result of the council is that no agreement 
is to be made with C&aelig;sar, and that Antony must not expose himself in battle
(line 434). In the next Scene Cleopatra tearfully narrates to Antony the fearful
omens which had attended her devotions in the temple, Apis had with his breath
extinguished the incense, which betokened that Egypt should be reduced to ashes;

<pb n="528"/>
the nine and twenty signs wherein this sacred animal resembles the moon, all disappeared, 
where his colour was usually white it turned black, and where black it was
like snow, etc. Antony comforts her by interpreting all these signs as favourable.
Proculeius, the ambassador of C&aelig;sar, is announced, and Antony gives him audience.
Proculeius declares that his mission is in the interest of peace; consequently he and
Antony begin mutual recriminations which continue, in stichomythia, in almost
unbroken sequence for one hundred and four lines; but at last Proculeius unfolds the
agreement, namely, that Antony shall leave Egypt, break away from Cleopatra, live
with Octavia, and set free Artabazes. Antony promises that he will set free Artabazes 
and will give an answer to the other demands before the day is over. In
the <hi rend="italic">Second Act</hi> Thyreus tells Cleopatra that C&aelig;sar is very much in love with her,
that &lsquo;the flames of love have melted into one his soul and hers.&rsquo; But Cleopatra is
cautious and suspects that Thyreus is dissembling, because, as she says, the cause of
Rome's enmity to Antony is that it imagines that he drew gall and poison from her
breast; it had washed the blood from the hands of the murderers of the great Julius,
on the pretext that he had been defiled by her bed, as though it had been a nest of
vipers, and, furthermore, Augustus was no boy that he should love her now, when
all her beauty was gone. When Thyreus replies that Augustus is sincere in his love,
Cleopatra asks why then, when Antony offered to kill himself, if thereby the possession
of Egypt could be secured to her, he did not accept Antony's offer? <name type="authority">Kerckhoffs</name>
is aware that <name type="authority">Casper</name> found this offer of Antony in Dion Cassius and yet he says that
nothing more dramatic can be imagined than this unconscious admission by Cleopatra 
of Antony's magnanimity of soul. Thyreus persists and begs the Queen to permit 
Augustus to &lsquo;taste the spice of love on her sugar lips, where kisses will draw out
&lsquo;each other's soul.&rsquo; He confirms his commission by producing C&aelig;sar's bond and seal.
Cleopatra accepts all ecstatically, sends a ring to C&aelig;sar as a pledge that she surrenders 
herself wholly to him, and that
<quote><l>Before Osiris grants another dawn and light,</l>
<l>Antonius to the world shall bid a long good night.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>In order to fulfill this promise, Cleopatra, in the next Scene, induces her son,
C&aelig;sarion, and her privy counselor, Archibius, to join her in vengeance on Antony,
who, she falsely tells them, has approved of a plan, broached in the foregoing conference 
with Proculeius, for destroying her by poison smeared over her body.
Archibius decides that Antony must die, and C&aelig;sarion silently acquiesces. They
are interrupted by the announcement that Antony seeks an interview with Cleopatra,
who, after the departure of Archibius and C&aelig;sarion, order the three children to be
brought in. Antony enters much dejected, but declares that a kiss will prove a
refreshing western wind to his languishing heart. Cleopatra immediately begins,
however, with bitter reproaches for not having been admitted to the conference with
Proculeius, which she chooses to interpret as a proof that Antony intends to desert
her. She bids the children embrace the knees of their father and beg for mercy for
her and for themselves. They obey, and with such effect that Antony's heart is
deeply moved, and he swears by Osiris and by Jupiter that, until Clotho shall sever
his thread of life, he will love and honour Cleopatra, and will instantly send back
Proculeius, unanswered, to C&aelig;sar, and thereby break off all negotiations. Hereby
Cleopatra's treachery gains much, but to make the breach between Antony and
C&aelig;sar complete, she begs Antony to send to C&aelig;sar the head of Artabazes. To this
Antony consents, and gives orders for the immediate execution of the man whose
life was one of C&aelig;sar's special stipulations. This Scene is, I think, the best in the
<pb n="529"/>
play. The phraseology is less stilted and the style less turgid, and there are one or
two touches of nature, as where one of the children says &lsquo;just let him have a helmet
&lsquo;and armour and he'll show them how to fight&rsquo;; and another says that &lsquo;he would
like to go at C&aelig;sar with steel and dagger.&rsquo; When Cleopatra is left alone she exults
in the success of her plans thus far, but must proceed with caution; she has a
secret treaty with C&aelig;sar, whereof the condition is Antony's death; she rehearses the
different modes of killing him and finally she adopts the plan (herein <name type="authority">Casper</name> follows
Dion Cassius), of sending word of her death to Antony, so that he may commit suicide, 
as she is sure he will. In the <hi rend="italic">Third Act</hi> Cleopatra takes Charmium into her
confidence and instructs her that as soon as she sees her mistress's body lying asleep
as though dead, she must instantly run to Antony and make him believe that the
apparent death is real. In the next Scene Cleopatra summons to her side all her
attendants and makes due preparations for her fictitious death. Before beginning
she bids them all, her &lsquo;dearest sisters&rsquo; as she calls them, learn from her example
that high station is a toil and a burden; &lsquo;no thistle pricks as severely as silk and
purple; a sceptre breaks easier than glass; hardly had I seen the light of day
before misery hung about my neck; I had more wormwood than mother's milk.
Before my tongue could lisp I suffered by my parent's death, and my brother's hate.&rsquo;
She begs her attendants not to dissuade her, but rather to help her onward in that
garden path where she can engraft her life on posterity. &lsquo;Bind diamonds in my
ringlets, and crown my heavenly head with roses and narcissus; let pearls kiss my
bare neck; place emeralds on my arms and purple on my shoulders, so that I cannot 
fail to please the bridegroom.&rsquo; &lsquo;Whom will Cleopatra wed?&rsquo; asks Belisama.
&lsquo;Death,&rsquo; is the reply, &lsquo;whom I welcome more joyfully than when I entrusted myself
to C&aelig;sar or to Antony.&rsquo; Her directions, strictly, I suppose, in accordance with
Egyptian rites, are as minute as they are tedious, but they are at last complete and
Cleopatra takes the cup, exclaiming as she does so, &lsquo;O nectar of our life! Cordial of
our soul! O sugar-sweet poison! Happy he, who through thee evades all misery!
Who, under this image of death, masks his highest weal! <hi rend="italic">Charmium.</hi> She grows
pale! <hi rend="italic">Iras.</hi> Serene Highness! <hi rend="italic">Charm.</hi> She is speechless! <hi rend="italic">Sida.</hi> She has the death
rattle! <hi rend="italic">Charm.</hi> She is dying! <hi rend="italic">Babia.</hi> Tear off her clothes! <hi rend="italic">Belisama.</hi> Alas her
pulse is stopped!&rsquo; etc. They decide to send word, by Eteocles, at once to Antony,
who in the meantime is passing through an uncomfortable ordeal. After he had fallen
asleep the ghosts of Antigonus, Artabazes, and Jamblichus, three kings whom he had
caused to be executed, appear and curse him. He awakes in affright and in a frame
of mind sufficiently terror-stricken to receive the added horror of Cleopatra's death,
which Eteocles announces. Antony bewails his unhappy lot, and, after describing
in glowing language Cleopatra's charms, commands Eros to kill him. Here <name type="authority">Casper</name>
follows Plutarch's account of Eros's noble self-sacrifice and Antony's unsuccessful
attempt to kill himself. Diomedes enters and tells Antony that Cleopatra's life
has been saved by the administration of antidotes. Antony begs to be taken to
her. On his arrival Cleopatra breaks forth in lamentations over him, over her lot,
and in railings against Fate. Antony expresses his joy in having her lap as his
death-bed, bids her bury him like a Ptolemy, cease her lamentations, which will disturb 
his rest in the grave, and force him to wander as a doleful ghost at midnight,
about the palace, to see how she and the children are faring. He dies finally and
Cleopatra falls fainting on his body. The <hi rend="italic">Fourth Act</hi> is mainly taken up with discussions 
by C&aelig;sar and his friends over the government of Alexandria and the disposal 
of Cleopatra. Toward the close C&aelig;sar and the Queen have an interview,
<pb n="530"/>
wherein <name type="authority">Casper</name> follows Dion Cassius as far as concerns the display by Cleopatra
of Julius C&aelig;sar's images and his letters to her, but, unlike Dion Cassius, Augustus
excels the queen in hypocrisy and affects to be desperately enamoured of her, calls
her &lsquo;fairest queen&rsquo; and promises to give her not only her kingdom, her sceptre, her
freedom, but even more. In return, Cleopatra offers her heart to him and will swear
to be true and faithful, and will resign the key to her treasure; she declares that her
heart is without guile and her body without a blemish. Whereat Augustus asks what
stone would not then become wax, what ice not become sulphur, and adds that it is the
powerful magnet of Cleopatra's beauty that draws him. This emboldens Cleopatra;
and she advises him to &lsquo;enjoy the pleasure of his youthful prime; time flies like an
arrow; desire is but a shadow. A heart that will not yield to love is a star shrouded
in clouds, a jewel under water; of what use is the coral that is ungathered in the
sea? On the other hand, what delight it must be, to one who is a great lord and
has harvested both victory and the fruits of love, to rest his half-exhausted frame on
some tender breast, and to be quickened by the sweet dew of the kisses of his beloved
one.&rsquo; Augustus responds: &lsquo;Thou Venus of our time, thou sun of the world, whom
my enamoured soul accepts as an idol, Augustus surrenders to thee, he exchanges
his laurel wreath for thy myrtle chaplet. As far as earth's remotest bound thou
shalt be adored. But,&rsquo; he continues, &lsquo;the errors of others should teach us caution.
Julius C&aelig;sar gained hatred, and Antony enemies and war, because they showed in
Rome the wounds received from Cleopatra's love before they showed the Romans
Cleopatra herself, whose beauty would have converted hate into idolatry.&rsquo; Hence
it follows with the certainty of a <hi rend="italic">Q. E. D.</hi> that Cleopatra must go to Rome, and then
the way will be smooth for her to marry the Emperor of the World. But Cleopatra
sees the snare, and evades a downright refusal to go to Rome by begging from
Augustus the privilege, before she leaves for that city, of burying Antony according
to Egyptian rites. C&aelig;sar accedes, and the <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> closes. The <hi rend="italic">Fifth Act</hi> opens with
Cleopatra's busy preparations for embalming Antony. &lsquo;Come, dearest sisters,&rsquo; she
says to her attendants, &lsquo;come, bring to him a true offering of fidelity and the last
pledge of love. Defile your bodies, uncover and beat your breasts. For seven days
&lsquo;do not wash yourselves. Wreathe the sarcophagus with ivy. Put on sackcloth
instead of silk. Drink no wine, only water, so that you can weep abundantly. Wet
your bread and scanty food with tears. Take this crooked iron, Iras, and drag out
Antony's brains through his nose, and pour in balsam.&rsquo; Iras observes that Eteocles
has already opened the body, and gives in detail the disposition of the organs; it is
hardly worth while to follow the steps of the process, which are probably as accurate
as they are certainly repulsive; they are not to be found in the edition of 1661, but
are a cheerful addition to that of 1680. Cleopatra's attendants try to comfort her by
dwelling on C&aelig;sar's love, but she hands to them a paper that she had found among
Antony's effects, in C&aelig;sar's handwriting, wherein Antony is instigated to murder
her; and also shows a letter from Dolabella setting forth C&aelig;sar's intention of sending 
her at once a prisoner to Rome. There is now for her no alternative; she must
take her fate into her own hands. Antyllus, the oldest son of Antony and Fulvia,
enters and denounces Cleopatra as an &lsquo;accursed sorceress! a bloodthirsty Medea&rsquo;
whom he would incontinently kill, were it not that she had determined to kill herself. 
Cleopatra offers him a sword and her breast, and bids him &lsquo;Strike! <hi rend="italic">Antyllus.</hi>
Absurd folly! <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra.</hi> Strike! <hi rend="italic">Antyllus.</hi> I would, but I cannot. <hi rend="italic">Cleop.</hi> I
will accept the stroke and death as a kindness. <hi rend="italic">Antyll.</hi> Blood so black shall never
stain my hands. <hi rend="italic">Cleop.</hi> Then let me uncursed die, Antyllus. <hi rend="italic">Antyll.</hi> Deserved
<pb n="531"/>
or undeserved, I'll cast no stone upon thy grave. <hi rend="italic">Cleop.</hi> Then joyfully I die.&rsquo;
Cleopatra writes a letter to C&aelig;sar begging him to let her lie by Antony's side. Iras
and Charmium avow their determination to share their mistress's fate, but she endeavours 
to dissuade them,&mdash;wherefore should C&aelig;sar treat them harshly? who else would
see that she was befittingly buried? &lsquo;Believe me,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;if you die for fear,
you do not show your love for me as much as you would if you waited in order to
perform the last sad rites for me.&rsquo; Cleopatra removes the leaves in the basket of
figs and shows the aspics. &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Charmium.</hi> Ye gods! and is that horrid thing to strike
poison into your lily-white arm? <hi rend="italic">Cleop.</hi> Yes, to lift the gates of the body to our
lofty soul.&rsquo; Diomedes, to hearten them all, applies an aspic to his own arm and
falls dead.

<quote><sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> The faithful knave wins fame and teaches us how easy 'tis to die.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Belsamina.</speaker><l> The asp that killed the knave so swiftly will not sting Cleopatra;

<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Suggest not such a thing for me. It will not touch my arm! 'Tis thirsty

Already am I faint and drowsy. Come, dearest, and take from me the last fond
kiss. <stage>[Dies.</stage></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Salambo.</speaker><l> She shivers! she sleeps! she's dead!</l></sp></quote>
</p>
<p>Iras also applies the asp and dies, as does also Charmium after she has filled with
flowers the hands of her dead mistress.</p>
<p>The tragedy continues for nearly five hundred lines more. To the five corpses
on the stage: Antony, Cleopatra, Iras, Charmium, Diomedes,&mdash;Antyllus is added.
As in Dion Cassius, the Psylli are summoned in vain.</p>

<hi rend="italic">Antony</hi> was Mr Betterton; <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar,</hi> Mr Smith; <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi> Mrs Mary Lee; <hi rend="italic">Octavia,</hi>
Mrs Betterton; <hi rend="italic">Iras,</hi> Mrs Gibbs; <hi rend="italic">Charmion,</hi> Mrs Hughes. In the <hi rend="italic">Reprint</hi> of 1696
the same parts are assumed by the same actors. Of this play Sir Walter Scott said
that he had read it once and would &lsquo;assuredly not read it a second time,&rsquo;&mdash;a resolve
which, I think, all will share, and include in it even the following brief synopsis:</p>
<p>When the first Scene opens, the battle of Actium has taken place and M&aelig;cenas
urges Octavius to prosecute the war vigorously against Antony; Octavius acquiesces for
policy's sake and for Octavia's. In the next Scene two Egyptian lords determine to
plot against Antony in order to free Cleopatra and their country. Antony enters
and decidedly shows the white feather. He tells Canidius to go out and fight the
Romans, while he remains within the walls and takes care of Cleopatra; but when
Cleopatra enters, her warlike spirit inspires him and the <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> closes with Cleopatra's
declaration that her &lsquo;heart can danger though not absence bear, To Love, 'tis Wax,
but Adamant to Fear.&rsquo; Antony chivalrously responds, &lsquo;Mine has such Courage
from your Firmness took, That I can almost bear a parting look.&rsquo; In <hi rend="italic">Act II.</hi> it
<pb n="532"/>
appears that Photinus is a traitor to Antony and in love with Iras. He determines
to make his peace with C&aelig;sar by dispatching Antony, then seize the crown and
make Iras his queen. In the next Scene Octavia appears in C&aelig;sar's tents and intercedes 
for Antony; when her brother says that he must for her sake punish Antony,
she attempts to stab herself, in order thus to remove the cause of the quarrel.
M&aelig;cenas prevents her. C&aelig;sar remarks that he will forgive her for her rashness
if she will promise not to do it again, and immediately departs after requesting
M&aelig;cenas to look after her and &lsquo;see remov'd all means of Death, Let Nature and
&lsquo;not rage conclude her breath.&rsquo; M&aelig;cenas at once proceeds to make vehement love
to Octavia and says &lsquo;he'll the reversion wait And live like Heirs in hope of an
&lsquo;estate.&rsquo; Octavia repels him and says she will not survive Antonius an hour, and,
rather enigmatically, tells him that &lsquo;My dear Antonius, him you must preserve, If
aught you from Octavia would deserve,&rsquo; and at once departs. M&aelig;cenas thereupon
concisely states the situation, as he looks after her, &lsquo;Whom whilst he lives I never
can enjoy, And if he dies she will herself destroy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The first Scene of <hi rend="italic">Act III.</hi> is taken up with a conversation between C&aelig;sar, M&aelig;cenas, 
and Agrippa wherein the riotous living of Antony is discussed and denounced,
&lsquo;especially,&rsquo; says Agrippa, &lsquo;his dotage on the Queen Employs my wonder; was it
ever seen A woman rul'd an Emperor till now? What horse the mare, what bull
obeys the cow?&rsquo; This vigorous and bucolic argument proves conclusive; they
decide that C&aelig;sar must conquer Antony and govern Rome. C&aelig;sar departs, after
uttering a remark more noteworthy for its undeniable truth than for its rhythm: &lsquo;Men
die of agues, too much heat or cold, And others grow ridiculous old.&rsquo; In the next
Scene Antony, Canidius, and Cleopatra discuss the terms of peace offered by C&aelig;sar,
which they all decide are impossible. Thyreus enters and Antony leaves. As an
ambassador from C&aelig;sar, Cleopatra will have nothing to say to Thyreus, but when he
pleads as a lover, she exacts from him a promise to tell her, as soon as he can
find out, what disposition C&aelig;sar will make of her should he prove the conqueror.
Anthony returns in time to see Thyreus on his knees, kissing Cleopatra's hand, and
orders him, in spite of Cleopatra's remonstrances, to be taken out and whipped. This
whipping of a Roman is more than the Roman soldiers in the city can tolerate; they
mutiny and liberate Thyreus, but are restored by Lucilius to allegiance to Anthony.
In the <hi rend="italic">Fourth Act</hi> Octavia again pleads with C&aelig;sar for the life of Antonius, but finding 
him obdurate, announces that she will go to Rome and stir up the city against
him; a Messenger enters with the news that a battle is now raging. In this battle
Antony encounters Thyreus and vanquishes him. Thyreus with his dying breath
bids his victor tell Cleopatra that C&aelig;sar intends to take her in triumph to Rome.
Antony then meets C&aelig;sar and, in single combat, C&aelig;sar is beaten back, but before
Antony can pursue his advantage, word is brought that Cleopatra has been taken
prisoner. Antony flies to her assistance and rescues her. While these events are in
progress outside the town, Photinus, still in love with Iras, heads a rebellion within
the town, against both Antony and Cleopatra. Lucilius, however, within the city
overcomes him and brings him as a prisoner to Antony, to whom he lies, as to his
loyalty, so ingeniously that Antony forgives him. In the <hi rend="italic">Fifth Act,</hi> while Antony is
boasting to Cleopatra of his successes, word is brought that Octavius with his whole
force is advancing to battle; Antony rushes forth to meet him, leaving Cleopatra to
indulge in gloomy forebodings. Antony is utterly defeated, and re-enters, exclaiming:
<quote><l>Gape Hell, and to thy dismal bottom take</l>
<l>The lost Antonius; this was our last stake.</l></quote>

<pb n="533"/></p>
<p>Photinus enters, crying,
<quote><l>Horror on horror! Sir, th' unhappy Queen</l>
<l>Betray'd by a report that you were slain!</l>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> I understand you, she herself has kill'd</l>

<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> How well had I been with great Julius slain,</l>
<l>Or by some flying Parthian's darted cane.</l></sp></quote>
</p>
<p>Antony then resolves to kill himself, so as to &lsquo;let Romans now each other love,
Their tedious quarrel I will soon remove.&rsquo; He requests Lucilius to kill him, but
Lucilius passes the weapon through his own body. Antony remarks,
<quote><l>The noblest way: thou show'st me what to do.</l>
<l>Thou giv'st th' example, and I'le give the blow.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>He thereupon ineffectually stabs himself, and observes to Photinus,
<quote><l>Thou can'st not now my fatal journey stay.</l>
<sp><speaker>Phot.</speaker><l> Nor would I, Sir, you'r fairly on your way.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Death soon will place me out of fortunes reach;</l>

</quote></p>
<p>(This is really the best Scene, I think, in the play.) Charmion and Iras enter
and reveal to Antony that Cleopatra is alive in her Monument, where
<quote><l>All she holds dear she has throng'd there, but you,</l>
<l>And now intreats that you will enter too.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>Antony is not so far dead but that he manages to walk off to the Monument.
C&aelig;sar and his friends enter, as does also Photinus with Antony's sword, but he is
received with suspicion. A servant enters and announces that Octavia is &lsquo;past all
human grief and care.&rsquo;

</p>
<p>Antony advises Cleopatra to submit to C&aelig;sar, who will pity her and recognise
that her beauty and his love were all her crime.

<p>Antony dies exclaiming,

</quote></p>
<p>Cleopatra masters her overwhelming grief long enough to apostrophise in thirteen
lines the fleeting frailty of beauty, and its unreality; and finally tells Charmion that

<p>C&aelig;sar and his train enter, after having battered down the doors, and all duly
express horror at the sight of the corpses. Photinus runs to Iras, who with her
dying breath reproaches him for not having made her queen of Egypt; lest she
should further reveal his treachery, he stabs her, and is at once killed by a soldier
who says he is Iras's brother. C&aelig;sar wonders what Antony could have feared from
a brother who owed to him all his honours, and asserts that it would have been a
godlike pleasure to have shared the empire again with him. To make a clean sweep
of everything, Agrippa announces that Cleopatra had burned all &lsquo;her vast treasure

<div2 type="subsection" n="Cleopatre, by Mr De la Chapelle"><head><title>Cleopatre</title>, by <name>Mr De la Chapelle</name></head>
<p>In 1682 there was published in Paris, <ref targOrder="U" target="chapelle-1682"><hi rend="italic"><emph>Cleopatre</emph> par Mr</hi> <name type="authority">De la Chapelle</name></ref>. The
character of Cleopatra is here drawn with bolder strokes than in either <name type="authority">Jodelle</name> (if
we omit the Scene with Seleucus) or <name type="authority">Garnier</name>. On one occasion, when Antony confesses 
that he is about to desert her, there is an outburst of hot indignation in which
she calls him &lsquo;barbare,&rsquo; and threatens him with an undivulged cruel retaliation, before
which the Roman quails. Unfortunately, I cannot say that this character is fully
sustained. Possibly, it was the author's intention, but certain it is that before the
drama closes Cleopatra is subdued to a dove-like meekness in her utter subjection
to love for Antony. Octavia takes a prominent part in the drama; her devotion to
Antony is so unbounded that it includes even Cleopatra, and she vainly struggles to
save them both.</p>
<p>The Scene opens after the battle of Actium; throughout the <hi rend="italic">First Act</hi> Cleopatra
does not, and will not appear. She is so overwhelmed with grief at the ruin and
disgrace she has brought on Antony that she refuses to see him. This seclusion is
Octavia's opportunity, and while Antony is chafing under the absence of his queen,
his wife presents herself to him and adjures him for his own sake and for their children's 
to return to Rome and placate the Senate. Her success is such that Antony
demands time to think it over. The <hi rend="italic">Second Act</hi> shows us Cleopatra brooding over
the fear that Antony is about to desert her, and over his changed demeanour, which
is very different from his tender forgiveness after her flight at Actium, where
<foreign lang="fr"><quote><l>Il vit que je fuyois, son ame en f&ucirc;t atteinte,</l>
<l>Et l' amour fit en luy ce qu'en moy fit la crainte,</l></quote></foreign>

and when he swore endless vows of eternal fidelity. And here occurs a touch of
nature, trifling to be sure, but refreshing amid so much moralising: Cleopatra had
sent Iras to the harbour to learn what she could of Antony's movements, and had
not yet returned; hereupon, Cleopatra declares that Iras knows how impatient she
is for news and yet takes not the smallest pains to hurry; it is only too clear that
nobody cares for her or her misfortunes, and that she must weep all alone; everybody
had abandoned her. At that very instant Iras enters. She reports that Antony is
about to leave Alexandria and Cleopatra for ever, and that on this condition peace had
been made with Rome. She also reports that Octavia is in the palace and waiting to
see Cleopatra. Octavia enters and implores Cleopatra, by her very love for Antony,
to force him to return to Rome, to his honour, and to his power, and that by so doing
she will convert the hatred of the Romans into admiration, and secure her own throne.
Cleopatra replies that her advice to Antony would be to die rather than return to
Rome, only to be shorn of his power like poor Lepidus. Octavia asks how Cleopatra, 
in case there should be more fighting, would bear the news of Antony's death.
&lsquo;Like a Queen,&rsquo; Cleopatra replies, &lsquo;A thousand famous examples, of which your
Roman history, Madame, is full, will give me the aid of a noble despair in ending
my sad days. You will never see me, like a dastard, disgrace the hundred kings
from whom I am descended. Maugre Rome and maugre the angry Fates I shall
know how to rejoin the <hi rend="italic">manes</hi> of a husband.&rsquo; Octavia ends the interview by saying 
that she will depart, &lsquo;but, Madame, in spite of you, in spite of him, I will today
save you both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Antony enters and pleads with Cleopatra that it is necessary that he should submit 
<pb n="536"/>
to Octavius and depart for Rome in order to save her from further indignities and
from being paraded in C&aelig;sar's triumphal procession. Cleopatra sees through this
specious reasoning, and rises to tragic grandeur as she denounces his perfidy, and
relates how for his sake she had ruined her kingdom, and had been dishonoured
throughout the world by his fatal love, but she no longer retains him, and bids him
go to Octavius, become his slave; &lsquo;Go, brighten his court! I too will be present!
Perhaps you will find me more cruel than pleasant!&rsquo;</p>
<p>These parting words alarm Antony with their veiled threat, and he resolves that
he will try to thwart her insidious plans. In a <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> with Agrippa, C&aelig;sar's ambassador, 
Octavia renews her vow that she will remain near Antony in war or in peace;
and reasserts her determination to share Cleopatra's fate and to save both her and
Antony. Octavia retires; Cleopatra enters and makes full submission to C&aelig;sar
and to Rome. Antony enters unexpectedly and tells Agrippa that his treaty of peace
with C&aelig;sar is broken off, that there must now be war, and that he casts in his lot
with Cleopatra. Agrippa, astounded, retires; Cleopatra's anger, mingled with jealousy, 
has no whit cooled; she treats Antony at first with the utmost disdain. He
accuses her of ingratitude. She asks if she is to remain for ever trembling, and for
ever accused, exposed to the violence and jealous transports of an enraged barbarian;
she sees his design to drive her away and she will at once gratify him. He implores
her to remain and swears that his only thought has been to protect her and her children 
in case of his death. This touches Cleopatra and she yields. Without him,
she confesses, she would not care to live, and at this very moment her dearest wish
is to see him happy and to die for him. Antony then renews his vows of love, and
describes the great deeds he is about to perform in the war. At this moment word
is brought to him that the Romans are everywhere victorious and that his presence
is needed in the camp. Antony takes a touching farewell of Cleopatra, and adjures
her to preserve the memory of his faithful love. But

<quote><l>Before my brave army I must be calm</l>
<l>And hide all my trouble.&mdash;So adieu, Madame. <stage>[Exit.</stage></l>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Dieux! if today, Death should humble his pride!</l>
<l>I'll follow him swiftly, and die by his side!</l></sp></quote>
</p>
<p>In the next <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> Cleopatra is alone, and horror-struck at the thought that even at
that very moment Antony's head may have been brought to C&aelig;sar.

<quote><l>My glorious spouse [<hi rend="italic">Epoux</hi>]!&rsquo; she cries, &lsquo;'twas my fatal love,&mdash;</l>
<l>That sent thee too soon to mansions above.</l>
<l>'Twas I who deprived thee of crown and of light!</l>
<l>I will follow thee, dearest, in fortune's despite!</l></quote>
</p>
<p>While the battle is going on and Cleopatra is in the extremity of fear and alarm,
Octavia appears and asserts that she is come to share Cleopatra's fate. Cleopatra is
not cordial, and remarks that the combat is not yet decided. But at that instant
Charmion hurries in and announces that all is lost, C&aelig;sar's victorious troops are
already in the city. Thereupon Cleopatra hastens to her Monument. Antony
returns defeated, disgraced, and in despair, seeking Cleopatra, whom alone he
wishes to see.</p>
<p>Octavia is warned that her husband is bent on suicide, and is seeking Cleopatra to
bid her farewell. Octavia's excellent character rises to the occasion. After all the
misfortunes which the queen has caused her, she says that were she herself not a
Roman she could hate her, but,
<pb n="537"/>

<cit><quote><l>These jealous stirrings and these mortal quarrels,</l>
<l>Which lacerate the heart of vulgar lovers,</l>
<l>Awake in mine no thought to stain my glory.</l>
<l>What if, for her, my love has been disdained,</l>
<l>Unhappy is she, and, like me, a woman.</l>
<l>I'll seek my brother, and assure my spouse</l>
<l>That Roman hearts cannot withstand my tears.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="chapelle-1682">&mdash;p. 48.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Word is brought to Antony that Cleopatra had taken refuge in her Monument,
which had been attacked by Roman soldiers to whom Charmion had thrown out some
treasures and with tears had announced Cleopatra's death, whereat even the rough
soldiers were touched and retired. Antony's attempted suicide follows, as in Plutarch; 
he learns from Iras that the queen still lives. The way in which Antony was
carried to the Monument, and, by the scarves and veils which Charmion had twisted
into ropes, was pulled up by Cleopatra and her women, is described to Octavia. In
the last <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> Cleopatra tells C&aelig;sar's ambassador that she now surrenders herself;
she has left the Monument where the inhuman Gods had just snatched from her the
greatest of all the Romans; she had closed the lids over his eyes, all stained with
blood and dust. &lsquo;It is I,&rsquo; she cries, &lsquo;who killed him. Too great a solicitude for my
life has cost me my life. The deplorable state in which his loss has left me,&mdash;these
veils stained with blood, his last sighs breathed out in my arms, and my own sorrows,
all demand my death. If I defer it for a few minutes, 'tis to ask of C&aelig;sar only one
favour, and C&aelig;sar must remember that to me is really due his glory, which he would
never have attained had not Antony been blinded by his fatal love for me. This
fatal love the gods sent to his breast, The Senate exiled him,&mdash;and I did all the rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The favour which she asks is that such funeral honours as are beyond her power
may be given to Antony. She does not desire any proud mortuary pomp, which
may attempt to repair the ignominy of his ending;
<quote><l>'Tis ample that his Shade obtains repose,</l>
<l>And that a little mound of heaped-up earth,</l>
<l>May prove an all-sufficing monument,</l>
<l>In honour of his sacred memory.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>Agrippa begs her to relinquish all thoughts of dying, assures her that C&aelig;sar recognises 
her virtues, and laments her misfortune; but she replies,
<quote><l>From cares like these, has Fate deliver'd me,</l>

Th&eacute;atre de la Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;oise, le 6. Novembre</hi> 1741. Paris, M. DCC. XLIII.&rsquo;
So runs the title of a play which the <hi rend="italic">Dedicatory Epistle</hi> informs us was written by
&lsquo;<name type="authority">Boistel</name>.&rsquo; (From his collected <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> we learn that his full name is <name type="authority">J. B. Robert
Boistel D'Welles</name>.) This version is, it appears to me, of more than common
interest. The author's conception of both Antony and Cleopatra is wholly original.
Antony's love for Cleopatra suffers only one momentary eclipse, and then he at once
recovers himself, and, with a strength unknown among other Antonies, shuts off
all possibility of a relapse by proclaiming to his army that Cleopatra is his wife.
Cleopatra is a truly pathetic figure. She makes a firm stand against Fate, even
counselling Antony to attack and conquer Rome. But when she finds that Fate is
too strong for her, she adjures Antony to desert her, the cause of all his misfortunes;
when he refuses, she retires to the Pyramids and there dies; how she finds death we
are not told. This version comes nearer than any other to canonizing Cleopatra.
Octavia does not appear in the play. Her place, as a representative of Antony's
home-ties, is taken by Julius, a son of Antony and herself. From what we are told
during the first few Scenes, we learn that after the battle of Actium, Antony separated 
himself from Cleopatra and, in a decisive battle, vanquished C&aelig;sar, but on his
victorious march to Rome was recalled to Egypt by a revolt in his army. C&aelig;sar
has followed him, and here in Alexandria appointed an interview for a discussion
of the peace demanded by the soldiers, and has designated, as the spot where it is
to take place, the royal tombs of the kings of Egypt, where Cleopatra has kept herself 
secluded ever since her disgraceful flight at Actium. It is intimated that the
wily C&aelig;sar has selected this spot in the hope that Antony, who is ignorant of Cleopatra's 
presence there, may again meet the Egyptian Queen, and again become her
thrall. The plot succeeds, Antony again meets Cleopatra, and they renew their
vows of eternal love. When Cleopatra learns, however, that C&aelig;sar is coming hither
for a conference, she is terrified lest, as she tells Antony, her eyes should behold

<cit><quote><l>A second Actium on this fatal spot.</l>
<l>Your foe hates you, and me all Rome abhors.</l>
<l>While you love me what is there I need fear?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l>
<l>I hear a noise. I yield to duty's call.</l>
<l>'Tis doubtless C&aelig;sar; go, my lord, and meet him,</l>
<l>And trust that I, most faithful to your love,</l>
<l>Will cherish thoughts of you to my life's end.</l>
<l>If ever I was worthy of your love</l>
<l>Do you here show that you are worthy mine</l>
<l>By flying hence, and making peace with C&aelig;sar.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="boistel-1743">p. 15.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Thus closes the <hi rend="italic">First Act.</hi> In the next the Triumvirs meet for discussion.
Antony is the magnanimous, open-hearted patriot, who would give liberty to all, and
<pb n="539"/>
to each a chance to live. C&aelig;sar is the wily, selfish politician. They agree to divide
the world between them, but C&aelig;sar requires some assurance that the glory of Rome
will not be tarnished, nor his sister live in contempt, through Antony's connection
with Cleopatra. Accordingly, he demands that the Egyptian queen shall either take
a husband of his choosing, or be delivered as a hostage to Rome. Antony blazes
into fury at the thought of either alternative. The conference ends with his defiance
of C&aelig;sar. In the next <hi rend="italic">Scene,</hi> Cleopatra counsels Antony to send her to Rome and
then win her back by conquering the city,&mdash;a plan which he scouts, but waxes
enthusiastic over the wonderful military genius it displays. In the next <hi rend="italic">Act,</hi> Julius,
Antony's son, unrecognized by his father, is presented to Antony by Eros as the
son of Ventidius. Julius describes the bitter grief with which Octavia mourns
Antony's desertion; Antony listens at first with coldness, but is finally touched;
when Julius informs him that Octavia is close at hand, and, throwing himself at
his father's feet, reveals his identity, Antony breaks down and bids him bring his
mother and he will be reconciled to her. But as soon as he is alone and calm, he
sees to what a frightful pass his promise to Julius has brought him,&mdash;nothing less than
a reconciliation with Rome and an abandonment of Cleopatra. He resolves that he
will seek out Octavius, and by a sudden oath extricate himself from the horror of his
situation. Cleopatra enters. To her, he recounts his misery and his remorse, and
says that he will fly to where she is not, or whithersoever death will guide his steps.
Cleopatra counsels him to obey necessity, and shows that even greater trouble is at
hand; C&aelig;sar is inciting Antony's soldiers to revolt by disseminating among them letters 
wherein they are exhorted either to surrender Cleopatra to him or to destroy the
beauty which Antony still adores. Cleopatra asserts that, as she is the only cause
of discord, it behooves her to fly to some distant land, abandoning her country and
resigning her diadem, convinced that&mdash;

<cit><quote><l>If thou wert happy, I should soon forget them.</l>
<l>In every danger, will sweet thoughts of thee</l>
<l>Make good the loss of honour, throne, and home.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="boistel-1743">p. 39.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Antony seeks out Octavius to give him his final answer; he will not confide Cleopatra 
to him; she shall remain his until death; he repudiates Octavia, she is of
C&aelig;sar's blood. He turns to the assembled Egyptians and Romans and exclaims:

<cit><quote><l>Cleopatra, it is true, was born a queen,</l>
<l>But 'tis in her the only fault I've found.</l>
<l>And if you think it does impute disgrace,</l>
<l>Remember it was Fate. I can repair it:</l>
<l>No more, Egyptians, do you have a queen!</l>
<l>Here, Romans, stands my wife, your sovereign lady!</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="boistel-1743">p. 41.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>He defies C&aelig;sar, and Rome, which he will one day force to bend the knee before
a woman. Cleopatra meets Julius, not knowing at first that he is Antony's son, and
begs him, as a friend to Antony, to persuade the latter to return to his duty. Julius
mistrusts her and reveals himself. Antony enters. Cleopatra begs him to withdraw
the empty title of wife which he had given her before his army,

<cit><quote><l>Thou hast deceived me, Antony; my just alarm</l>
<l>Demands the motive for this empty title.</l>
<l>But time is short, I'll spare thee all complaint.</l>
<l>Today, thy duty summons thee to say&mdash;</l>
<l>Which of the two shall now prevail with thee,</l>
<l>The tie of blood&mdash;or love, thy son&mdash;or I?

<pb n="540"/></l>
<l>But, be it either son, or be it loved one,</l>
<l>Go with me to thy army, and my wish fulfill.</l>
<l>Come! I must there resign into thy hands</l>
<l>This honour which excites thy Romans' ire.</l>
<l>Thou know'st how deadly, ire like this may grow.</l>
<l>Imagine this to be thy sole resource.</l>
<l>Art silent? What! must thy son blush for thee?</l>
<l>Or in thy heart can love do nothing more</l>
<l>Than here refuse me what my lips implore,</l>
<l>And load me down with gifts that I abhor?</l>
<l>Judge of thy plight, when here thou seest at one,</l>
<l>In the same hope, Cleopatra and thy son!</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="boistel-1743">p. 45.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>But Antony is obdurate, he has done what he believed to be his duty and is satisfied. 
Then Cleopatra becomes desperate and declares that Antony will call to her
in vain at the gates of the tomb where she is dying.

<quote><l>But if, at this cost, thou wilt not heed my voice</l>
<l>No more my presence shall thine eyes rejoice. Adieu!</l></quote>
</p>
<p>Julius recognizes her nobleness, and, as she is leaving, breaks forth in exclamations
of sincere admiration.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Fifth Act</hi> opens with a soliloquy by Cleopatra in which she apostrophises her
Antony, her &lsquo;dear lover,&rsquo; and begs him to believe that if she has ever made him
despair, if she has ever seemed to avoid him, or seemed afraid to see him, or, in the
happy hours gone by, has not yielded to the intoxication of joy which her love
prompted, she implores his pardon, and assures him that he was never more loved
than at this moment. She then turns to the Monuments of the dead kings of her
race, and to them declares that

<cit><quote><l>If loving thus a Roman hurts your pride,</l>
<l>And all my glory has seemed stained thereby,</l>
<l>My death shall here efface my life's misdeeds.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="boistel-1743">p. 55.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Eros brings her word of Antony's utter defeat, of the death of Julius by his father's
side, and of Antony's entreaty, before he retired from the battle, that Cleopatra should
be saved by Eros from the Romans. Cleopatra replies,

<quote><l>Fear nothing! I'm his wife and eke a queen!</l>
<l>None ever shall see Rome insult my woe.</l>
<l>Do what I could, I've caused all his misfortunes.</l>
<l>Perchance my death will more avail than tears.</l>
<l>If I, by fate, have tasted life's sweet joys,</l>
<l>I've learned, thank Heaven, to bow to fate's caprices.</l>
<l>Follow me both. The dreadful moment comes!</l>
<l>I pardon all! Blest gods! preserve my lover!</l></quote>
</p>
<p>These are the last words we hear from Cleopatra. Eros brings word to Antony
that she is dead. Antony in his distraction goes to the Monument and calls again
and again and again on Cleopatra, but in vain. He then commands Eros to kill him,
and the result is repeated from Plutarch, except that the stab which Antony gives
himself is entirely successful.

<p><ref targOrder="U" target="marmontel-1750"><name type="authority">Marmontel's</name> Tragedy of <hi rend="italic"><emph>Cl&eacute;opatre</emph></hi></ref> need not detain us long. It was, as is

<pb n="541"/>
ordinaires du Roi le 20. Mai, 1750.</foreign></quote>&rsquo; The author was but twenty-seven years old,
and his tragedy bears the marks of youth in everything but in its lack of fire. It
is cold, spiritless, timid, and insincere, with little discrimination of character. History, 
except in extremely meagre outlines, is disregarded. Indeed, it is difficult to
believe that the dramatist had ever read Plutarch or Dion Cassius, but, as far as
Ventidius is concerned, it seems as though he must have read Dryden. Octavia does
not appear among the <hi rend="italic">Dramatis Person&aelig;</hi>; and, apart from Cleopatra, the chief
interest is divded between Antony and C&aelig;sarion, a malapert boy, who thinks that
Rome and all Romans should bow the knee to him because in his veins runs the
blood of Julius C&aelig;sar. Cleopatra's love seems to be equally shared by Antony and
C&aelig;sarion. The play opens after the battle of Actium, and the  <hi rend="italic">First Act</hi> closes with
Cleopatra's attempts to cheer and encourage Antony. In the <hi rend="italic">Second Act</hi> Ventidius
awakens Antony's sense of honour and persuades him to desert Cleopatra, who is
plunged into despair when she learns of this resolution from Antony's own lips. She
thereupon determines that she will make her lover jealous, and so win him again,
by making love to Octavius. She is aware, she says, that she no longer possesses
the beauty of her first youth, but then age replaces youth, by the knowledge of more
seductive wiles. Whoso knows how to attack is already half a master. What a
triumph to vanquish the pride and the power of Octavius by the glances of her eyes!
Let the world call her perfidious and false! &lsquo;<quote>In my own eyes upright, content without flaw, I need but my heart, both for judge and for law.</quote>&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cleopatra meets Octavius and flatters him to the skies. He afterwards acknowledges 
to Proculeius that he had never before so thoroughly appreciated her fascinations, 
but they had not touched his heart. Antony and Octavius meet, and although
there are outbursts of indignation from the former, yet Octavius calms them and they
become friends. Cleopatra enters and places her crown in the hands of Octavius,
useless burden as it is on the brow of a captive. To Antony she says, &lsquo;<quote>You have
given me a master, let me bow down to him. From you or from him, my fate I must
crave I am either your spouse, or else I'm his slave. Choose ye.</quote>&rsquo;</p>
<p>Antony at once breaks off with Octavius and follows Cleopatra. In the battle
which follows Antony is defeated and C&aelig;sarion taken prisoner. Ventidius brings
word from Octavius that if Cleopatra wishes to save C&aelig;sarion's life she must herself
come and ask for it. She bids Ventidius take a poniard to C&aelig;sar wherewith he may
stab C&aelig;sarion, who will then die undisgraced. This Ventidius refuses to do and
holds out the hope that they may still conquer Octavius with the troops that survive,
but these troops will not fight unless Antony leaves Cleopatra. The queen then bids
Ventidius announce to the soldiers that the chain which bound her to Antony is
broken, and that she consents even to be fastened behind a chariot in Rome. In
the last <hi rend="italic">Act,</hi> Cleopatra instigates Eros to assassinate Octavius. Antony and Octavius
meet, the latter is cruel and haughty, and bids Antony choose his place of exile, but
he will retain Cleopatra and C&aelig;sarion as hostages; at that instant Eros aims a blow
with a poniard at Octavius's heart. Antony catches his arm and saves the life
of Octavius. Out of gratitude Octavius shows Antony the letter which Cleopatra
had written to him offering to surrender everything&mdash;even Antony himself. The
latter is thunderstruck and breaks out into wild despair. &lsquo;<quote>After such treason,</quote>&rsquo; C&aelig;sar
asks, &lsquo;<quote>can you love her?</quote>&rsquo; Antony replies &lsquo;<quote>I adore her! Leave me. Your pity
augments my frenzy. Leave me!</quote>&rsquo; &lsquo;<quote>What recourse, have you?</quote>&rsquo; asks Ventidius.
&lsquo;<quote>Death!</quote>&rsquo; answers Antony as he stabs himself. Cleopatra rushes in, falls on Antony's
body, sees the fatal letter which she had written as a decoy to Octavius, and understands 
<pb n="542"/>
it all. She implores Antony to speak to her; &lsquo;<quote>he extends his arms, his eyes
beam love,</quote>

<quote><l>Adoring at thy feet, behold thy queen!</l>
<l>Excess of love and sorrow brings me death!</l>
<l>Hah! would'st thou speak?&mdash;thou sighest,&mdash;thou diest!</l></quote>
</p>
<p>Cleopatra faints, but revives and begs from C&aelig;sar, as a last favour, that she may
place a crown of laurel on Antony's brow. Charmion brings a basket of laurel
leaves under which an aspic is concealed. Cleopatra seizes the aspic and applies
it to her breast. &lsquo;O<quote> ye gods!</quote>&rsquo; cries Octavius. Cleopatra, with the aspic still on
her bosom, exclaims, &lsquo;<quote>At last I'm free. My heart mounts up above Octavius and all
misfortunes! My son is alive and free. Adieu. Upon this funeral-pile I die a
queen.</quote>&rsquo; Her last words are,

<quote><l>My senses, Charmion, gently fade to rest&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l>
<l>I die, with kisses, on my hero's breast.</l></quote>

<div2 type="subsection" n="Antonio e Cleopatra, by Vittorio Alfieri"><head><title>Antonio e Cleopatra</title>, by <name>Vittorio Alfieri</name></head>
<p>The earliest drama of <name type="authority">Vittorio Alfieri</name>, written at the age of twenty-five, is
<ref targOrder="U" target="alfieri-1876"><title>Antonio e Cleopatra</title>,</ref>, acted for the first time in Turin, in June, 1775. The play was
several times re-written, and spoken of by the author in such contemptuous terms as
&lsquo;abortion,&rsquo; &lsquo;refuse,&rsquo; &lsquo;the first tragic and lyric attempt of a sucking poet,&rsquo; etc. Of the
origin of the version <name type="authority">Alfieri</name> gives a description in his <hi rend="italic">Life.</hi> &lsquo;<quote>Sitting unoccupied in
the saloon of his lady-love, whose health required long periods of retirement and
silence, he took up half-a-dozen leaves of paper that lay at hand, and sketched upon
them two or three scenes of dialogue, naming the principal speaker Cleopatra.
This name was suggested by the story woven on the tapestries of the apartment,
otherwise, he says, he might just as well have called his heroine Berenice or Zenobia.
When his paper was exhausted, he thrust the leaves under the cushion of a sofa,
and there they remained for over a year, during which he visited Rome, and went
through other experiences wholly alien to composition. Finding his passion exercising 
a baleful influence on his life, he determined to break it off, and in one of his
last visits to the lady's house, he withdrew from under the cushion his attempt at a
drama, and proceeded to recast it, still with no very definite plan.</quote>&rsquo;

Of this incident

<p>As far as the historical Cleopatra is concerned, <name type="authority">Alfieri</name> was eminently correct when
he said that he might just as well have called his heroine Berenice or Zenobia, with
this qualification, however, that no Berenice or Zenobia was ever so utterly deceitful
or cruel as is his Cleopatra. With the exception of <name type="authority">Kotzebue</name>, I can recall no dramatist 
who has given to Cleopatra so black a character as <name type="authority">Alfieri</name>. The Egyptian queen
drawn by the Italian is as much blacker than the melodramatic Egyptian queen of the
German as, in genius, <name type="authority">Alfieri</name> towered above <name type="authority">Kotzebue</name>. In reading <name type="authority">Alfieri's</name>

tragedy let us forget history, forget that Cleopatra was a Greek, and an Egyptian
only so far as she had been thus made by Ph&oelig;bus' amorous pinches, and passively
resign ourselves to the terror inspired by his heroine, whose character reflects the
lawless strength and medi&aelig;val warmth of the Italy of the Borgias.</p>
<p>The play opens in Alexandria, immediately after Cleopatra's arrival in Egypt after
her disgraceful flight from Actium. She knows nothing of Antony's fate, nor of the
result of the battle. She avows to her attendant, Ismene, her inextinguishable
remorse for having fled, and possibly causing thereby the defeat of Antony, of whom,
up to this moment, she has no news. In the course of her denunciation of herself,
she declares,

<cit><quote><l>It is not love that poisons now my days;</l>
<l>Ambition to command has ever moved me.</l>
<l>Each path, and none in vain, have I essay'd,</l>
<l>Which could conduct me to that lofty end;</l>
<l>My other passions all succumb'd to this,</l>
<l>And others' passions minister'd to mine.

</p>
<p>She learns that Antony has been utterly defeated. In the following soliloquy,
when alone, she throws off all disguise and we here learn her true character:

<cit><quote><sp><speaker>Cleo.</speaker><l> And now at last</l>
<l>I may pluck off the veil which hides the truth</l>
<l>In a dissembling heart's profound abysses.</l>
<l>Vanquish'd is Antony: this shame and treason</l>
<l>Perchance survives he not; the base design</l>
<l>I dared to form has been fulfill'd: so much</l>
<l>I could not hope for from my wicked flight.</l>
<l>But half the work remains for me to do,</l>
<l>And the most doubtful: vain are my misdeeds,</l>
<l>If to my fate I cannot link Augustus.</l>
<l>And from his heart what answer seek I? Love: . . .</l>
<l>Love, whom I oft inspired but never knew,</l>
<l>And from whose pow'r, when vanquish'd and disarm'd,</l>
<l>I glory drew, the very victor taming.</l>
<l>Sole barrier to my scheme was Antony:</l>
<l>If he's no more, my conquest will be easy.</l></sp></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="alfieri-1876">I, iv, p. 429.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>We next see her in an interview with the disgraced Antony, whose bitter upbraidings 
for her treachery she in vain tries to stem by protestations of her love. When
at last he says that he abhors life because he is endlessly disgraced, and abhors death
because she might find him out among the Shades and even there destroy his peace,
she breaks forth,

<cit><quote><l>Dost seek, barbarian, solace for thy fury?</l>
<l>It is not love thou feelest in thy breast,</l>
<l>I know it but too well: here, take this steel!</l>
<l>My bosom I unveil, where once thou restedst;</l>
<l>Thou know'st it not again, or hast forgotten;</l>
<l>Raise thy intrepid hand, and brandish it&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l>
<l>Then will the blood, which thou didst think unfaithful,
<pb n="544"/></l>
<l>Rush gushing forth, and straightway dye my garments,</l>
<l>And fall upon my feet, and both my hands</l>
<l>Will reek with it; and whatsoever breath</l>
<l>Remains to Cleopatra, tow'rds thee turning</l>
<l>Eyes full of love, and death, will she collect,</l>
<l>To say: Farewell, I loved thee, die for thee!&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l>
<l>And then, when thou hast fed thy angry looks</l>
<l>On thy dead enemy, by slow degrees</l>
<l>Thy fury will abate, and constancy</l>
<l>Revive in thee again, and thy old virtue.</l>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> How, Cleopatra, hast thou gain'd such power</l>
<l>Thus to delude me ever? yet I love</l>
<l>Thy treacheries, and those deceitful accents</l>
<l>Have from my ear reach'd even to my heart.</l></sp></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="alfieri-1876">II, iii, p. 436.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>She then gives a fictitious and flimsy excuse for her flight from Actium: that
she learned, only on the day she sailed, of a powerful rebellion among her subjects,
designed to deliver Egypt to C&aelig;sar, and she returned to quell it, not for the sake of
her own throne, but solely out of love for Antony. Antony is appeased, but not convinced. 
His supreme love for her forbids him to reason. But whether she be true
or false, he must leave her, encounter C&aelig;sar, and die in battle.</p>
<p>Having failed in her attempt to destroy Antony at Actium, Cleopatra now devises
a second and more fatal act of treachery which can hardly fail of a successful issue,
either in causing Antony to lose his life in battle or to commit suicide. She thus
discloses it to Ismene:

<cit><quote><l part="F"> a second plot</l>
<l>Is in the field prepared, t'assure the first.</l>
<l>The warlike trumpets scarcely will be heard</l>
<l>To sound the haughty signal for the fight,</l>
<l>When on the sea the ships, on land the cohorts,</l>
<l>Abandoning the leader they once own'd,</l>
<l>Will range themselves beneath Augustus' ensigns.</l>
<l>Left by their flight defenceless, Antony</l>
<l>Will turn against himself his bitter fury.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="alfieri-1876">III, i, p. 440.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>The plot succeeds and Antony returns, having touched a lower deep than he had
ever before conceived of, and with proof too clear of Cleopatra's treachery. There
is nothing before him now but infamy or death. The same will be Cleopatra's fate.
Since they are herein equal, he bids her take his sword, transfix with it her heart,
return it to him, and he will then transfix his own. She turns pale, but, still certain
of her supreme power over him, artfully evades the fatal stroke by saying that she
will teach him how to die, and in such an honourable death nothing is wanting

<cit><quote><l part="F">save that thy dearer hand</l>
<l>Should guide the friendly steel; mine maybe, trembling,</l>
<l>Or, little wont to strike, might give the lie</l>
<l>Both to my valor, and thy cruel thoughts.</l>
<l>Into this heart, by not an unknown path,</l>
<l>Th' avenging blade may plunge: deep sculptured there,</l>
<l>Thy fatal image will be found by thee;</l>
<l>Thou didst impress it, thou shalt cancel it;</l>
<l>The dagger take, and strike . . . thou turn'st away?</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="alfieri-1876">III, ii. p. 444.</ref></bibl></cit>

<pb n="545"/></p>
<p>As Cleopatra had foreseen, Antony refused to strike and was in the very act of
turning the sword against himself, when his hand was stayed by the announcement
that C&aelig;sar was about to enter. Cleopatra retires. C&aelig;sar addresses Antony in
friendly and encouraging terms, promising to bury all hostility in oblivion, and finally
invites him to return to Rome, but will not promise that Cleopatra shall not grace his
triumph. Antony breaks off the interview by saying that &lsquo;never shall that woman
be in Rome By mortal seen as subject to Augustus, Who once deserved the love of
Antony.&rsquo; In a conversation with his friend, Septimius, C&aelig;sar declares that he intends
to procure Antony's death at the hands of Cleopatra, and then, after having been kept
for the disgrace of being led in his triumph, Cleopatra herself shall be put to a
wretched death.</p>
<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Fourth Act</hi> there is an interview between Augustus and Cleopatra, who
puts forth all her arts to win the Roman conqueror; she claims his gratitude for
having wilfully betrayed Antony at Actium, and again for having caused all her
army to desert him. Augustus intimates his hopes that Cleopatra will some day be
his queen, and that she will not disdain to divide his sceptre with him; in those
happy days, perchance, Cleopatra will weep at having loved Antony so much. To
this artful suggestion Cleopatra replies,

<cit><quote><l>Too much I loved ungrateful Antony;</l>
<l>No more I love him; to amend my fault</l>
<l>I'm now prepared: it is not hate or vengeance</l>
<l>Which urges me to-day my fault to cancel,</l>
<l>But reason, the cool reason of a monarch.</l>
<l>For a long time his death has seem'd to be</l>
<l>Not only useful for this kingdom, long</l>
<l>By him despoil'd, but indispensable;</l>
<l>And now that his existence might once more</l>
<l>Re-open all the ancient wounds of Rome,</l>
<l>Destroy the peace of the whole world, and partly</l>
<l>Rob thee of thy supreme felicity,</l>
<l>'Twould be a crime to have compassion on him.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="alfieri-1876">IV, ii, p. 454.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Hereupon, Cleopatra, in unmeasured terms, confesses her admiration of Augustus,
who responds in protestations, equally sincere, of his love for her. At last Augustus
says, &lsquo;But Antony draws nigh; we must dissemble.&rsquo; When Antony enters he is
furious at the sight of Augustus alone with Cleopatra. Both endeavour to appease
him,&mdash;Augustus by indignation at Antony's mistrust, Cleopatra by asseverations of
her undying, faithful love,&mdash;for Antony's sake there is no sacrifice she will not make,
to fulfill his wishes; if he desires her to be led in triumph in Rome she will fly to
the chariot; without Antony she is a living corpse. At last Augustus bids Cleopatra
live as queen, and with her lover if she wishes it; in the temple let them all swear
lasting oblivion to their former hatred. After Augustus has left, the poor disgraced,
bewildered, heart-broken Antony tells Cleopatra that he will seek the temple to ask
the gods for guidance. As soon as he is gone, Cleopatra looks after him, saying,

<cit><quote><l>Credulous lover, go not to the temple;</l>
<l>Go rather to an unexpected death&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l>
<l>Yes, find thou death, and heinous treachery,</l>
<l>There, where thou look'st for life, for love and peace.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="alfieri-1876">p. 459.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Cleopatra thereupon commands Diomedes to follow Antony, and, in a dark passage 
leading to the temple, stab him, and let the victim also know at whose command
<pb n="546"/>
the blow is struck. Diomedes shortly returns, and reports that he has done the deed;
Cleopatra rejoices that &lsquo;<quote>the odious rugged chains of Antony at length are broken.</quote>&rsquo;
But Augustus receives the news of Antony's death by no means with the pleasure
that Cleopatra had anticipated. He is, on the contrary, sternly indignant, and speaks
of Antony as &lsquo;<quote>a great hero,</quote>&rsquo; &lsquo;<quote>a mighty warrior,</quote>&rsquo; who was worthy of a far more noble
end, and declares that &lsquo;<quote>To rid him of his enemies, Augustus Has never sought a
woman's coward hand.</quote>&rsquo; He commands Cleopatra to prepare to follow him to Rome,
there to render an account of her atrocious guilt. After he is gone Cleopatra's expressions 
of grief over the complete failure of her plan are bitter and her vows of vengeance 
on Augustus are deep. In the midst of them Antony enters. The courage of
Diomedes had failed him, or rather his compassion and love for Antony had proved
too great. In Antony's living presence no subterfuge will avail the wretched queen,
and she openly confesses that she feels neither pity nor remorse. In the last Scene
all the characters are present, Antony addresses Augustus in noble words of mingled
pride, resignation, and defiance; then, turning to Cleopatra, exclaims,

<quote><l>Fly, fly, O queen, the horrors of a triumph,</l>
<l>Horrors far worse than those of any death.</l>
<l>Wherefore alone to die is granted to us?</l>
<l>I could have given thee yet more of life&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l>
<l>Augustus, now will the whole world be thine:</l>
<l>Since I have taught thee how thou should'st not reign;</l>
<l>If thou, like me, should'st be unfortunate,</l>
<l>Learn to die bravely, as does Antony. <stage>[Kills himself.</stage></l>

<l>Thou fain wouldst tie me to thy car in Rome?</l>
<l>At least permit me to delight my eyes</l>
<l>In horrors and in blood, yes, e'en in death;</l>
<l>That I may lose my senses, and extract</l>
<l>Fresh fury from them&mdash;But since heav'n is slow</l>

but omitted in an edition, edited by Brooke's daughter, in 1792. (I have been unable

<p>&lsquo;<quote>Antony and Cleopatra&mdash;one-third, or perhaps one-half of this play is taken

are not happy additions to the <hi rend="italic">Dramatis Person&aelig;.</hi> In the 2d act Antony seeing
Cleopatra embrace Ptolemy, and not knowing who he is, leaves Alexandria in a
violent fit of jealousy&mdash;on being undeceived he returns. Shakspeare's play, with
all its faults, is infinitely superior to Brooke's&mdash;yet it must be allowed that a considerable

<div2 type="subsection" n="Kleopatra und Antonius, by Cornelius von Ayrenhoff"><head><title>Kleopatra und Antonius</title>, by <name>Cornelius von Ayrenhoff</name></head>
<p>In 1783, at a period when there was in Germany a temporary reaction against
Shakespeare, there appeared, <ref targOrder="U" target="ayrenhoff-1808"><title>Kleopatra und Antonius, A Tragedy in Four Acts,</title>
by <name type="authority">Cornelius von Ayrenhoff</name></ref>, <hi rend="italic">Austrian Lieutenant-Field-Marshall.</hi> In a long
and polemical Preface, addressed to Wieland, the writer denounces the dramatic
critics of the day. &lsquo;<quote>How can we expect,</quote>&rsquo; he exclaims in his indignation, &lsquo;<quote>that such
instructors in art, who have learned in public taverns all their knowledge of
refined society and there educated their taste, will defend the laws which govern the
Three Unities, elegant manners, and versification? What is more natural than that
they should keep on praising incessantly the monster [<hi rend="italic">Ungeheuer</hi>] Shakespeare as
the highest product of all nations, not because he often shows traces of great
genius, but because through him we become accustomed to all kinds of possible lawlessness, 
and that they should on every occasion dismiss with contempt the masterpieces 
of Corneille, Racine, and Voltaire?&rsquo;&mdash;p. 11. Ayrenhoff states how deeply he
had been stirred by the story of Cleopatra as told by Plutarch, and how inadequately
it had been presented by the dramatists. He had read the tragic story in Shakespeare, 
in la Chapelle, in Lohenstein, in Dryden, and exclaims, &lsquo;Poor Cleopatra!
thou fairest, loveliest, most unfortunate woman of antiquity! how brutally hast thou
been treated! It was not enough that thou wert robbed of thy throne and of thy
life by thy hateful contemporary, the cunning and cowardly Octavius, but the poets
of later days are still presenting thee on the public stage as a disgrace to thy sex!</quote>&rsquo;
After this open avowal of compassionate love and admiration, we find in Ayrenhoff's
tragedy what is to be expected, a Cleopatra who, while conformed to the records of
Plutarch, is idealised into a lofty character, quite too good for human nature's daily
food. I know of no other Cleopatra exactly like her. The tragedy is skilfully
written and has in it some good Scenes, especially the last, which, in Cleopatra's
treatment of Octavius, is really admirable. It is written in Alexandrine rhyming
couplets.</p>
<p>The opening Scenes somewhat remind us of Dryden. Lucilius, Antony's dear
friend and trusted General, corresponds to the Ventidius of the English poet; he cheers
Antony in his despair after Actium, warning him at the same time of the influence
<pb n="548"/>
of Cleopatra; at last he tells him plainly that defeat is certain unless he abandons
the queen. With the warning words &lsquo;Remember Actium!&rsquo; he departs, and Cleopatra
enters. She will not listen to Antony's gloomy forebodings. Nothing can trouble
her so long as Antony loves.

<quote><l>As we began, so, too, the end must be;</l>
<l>The greatest man the world can prize, art thou;</l>
<l>Sole woman worthy of such greatness, I.</l>
<l>Let throne and world be shattered by Octavius;</l>
<l>For Antony alone, does Cleopatra tremble.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>Antony tells the queen that even now a decisive battle is imminent. Cleopatra
replies that she is ready, &lsquo;<quote>to the determined soul, uncertainty alone is pain;</quote>&rsquo; and
points to the mausoleum which she has built, &lsquo;<quote>That, for Cleopatra will the refuge be.
Would, O beloved one! it might be with thee!</quote>&rsquo;</p>
<p>Antony reminds her of his vow not to survive her, but will not believe that such
a desperate remedy is near. Indeed, he is heartened for the battle to which he will
now go with joy, and return a victor, or word shall be brought to her of his death. He
departs and Cleopatra, thus early in the play, bids Charmion procure some asps and
tell the priests to make ready the mausoleum.</p>
<p>When the next <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> opens the battle has been fought, Antony has been victorious;
Cleopatra awaits his approach, with a laurel wreath wherewith to crown him.
Antony enters and is crowned by Cleopatra with extravagant expressions of love and
admiration. Word is brought that a veiled Roman lady desires an audience with
Antony alone. Antony refuses to see her, but Cleopatra intercedes. &lsquo;<quote>It may be.</quote>&rsquo;
she says, &lsquo;<quote>some wife or mother come to beg the life of her dear one; and, if so, send
the unhappy one to me, and I will try to comfort her.</quote>&rsquo; She leaves and the veiled
lady enters; at Antony's bidding she draws aside her veil and reveals Octavia. She
prostrates herself before him, but he bids her rise; she recalls to him their happy,
cloudless years in Athens, but not to win him back is she come, but to bring peace
between her husband and her brother, who, she declares, still holds Antony in fond
affection and is anxious to become reconciled. To none of her arguments will
Antony accede, but ends with saying that there are other obstacles, known only to
himself. Octavia understands this reference to Cleopatra and replies,

<quote><l>Full well I know that you will never take</l>
<l>A step that leads to Cleopatra's harm.</l>
<l>And this I honour; you can lightly judge</l>
<l>That I do not forget the cause of it. <stage>[Antony expresses astonishment.</stage></l>
<l>Ignoble hate has ne'er disgraced my heart.</l>
<l>Thou lov'st her&mdash;this shows she's worthy of thy love.</l>
<l>Although I ne'er can rival her in charms,</l>
<l>In greatness of the soul, she'll not excel me,</l>
<l>And more I ask not. Ah, not from envy</l>
<l>Would I disturb these bonds which make you blest</l>
<l>Far less to me, I own, is my own weal</l>
<l>Than thine,&mdash;dear father of my children!</l></quote>
</p>
<p>Antony replies that all is in vain; he honours her and will always honour her,
but, ascribe it to Fate if need be, he cannot comply with her wishes. The children
are then brought in, and they, with their mother, fall at the feet of Antony, who is
deeply moved. Cleopatra enters, and in the veiled Roman lady discovers Octavia,
<pb n="549"/>
who explains to her that she is come to try to extricate Antony from his perilous
position and begs for protection. Cleopatra replies,

<quote><sp><l>I wonder greatly at thy deed, Octavia!</l>
<l>How I regard it, I'll not now explain.</l>
<l>Yet know, whoe'er as friend,&mdash;for such thou claim'st to be,&mdash;</l>
<l>Seeks my protection, it shall be bestowed.</l>
<l>[<hi rend="italic">To Charmion</hi>] Be it your care to see throughout my court</l>
<l>That, like myself, she's treated as a queen.</l>
<l>[<hi rend="italic">To Octavia</hi>] Free, as thou may'st, from the engulfing flood</l>
<l>Thy husband, sinking neath the raging storm;</l>

<l>In nought will I deprive thee of the merit.</l>
<l>Complete your plans untrammelled. But know this,</l>
<l>From them I must be utterly excluded.</l>
<l>As soon as he has made his firm resolve,</l>
<l>Then, and not till then, I'll decide my lot.</l>
<l>And also until then, I ask you, Sir,</l>
<l>To suffer me to stay in my seclusion.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> What! Cleopatra asks&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Nothing; she commands;</l>

<p>As soon as she is gone Octavia breaks forth into admiration of the nobility of her
character. But none the less does she urge her vacillating husband to return with her
and their children to Rome and to the paths of virtue. Antony at last decides that
he will lay down his power and become a private citizen if C&aelig;sar will do the same.
Should C&aelig;sar consent to do this, and the Senate confirm her throne to Cleopatra, he
will live in Athens with Octavia, from whom no power on earth can then separate
him. Octavia is certain that she can persuade her brother to this course and the
Scene ends with profuse tears of joy all round, to which effusion Lucilius contributes.
Charmion, who had come to tell Octavia that her apartments were ready, is a witness
to this reconciliation and reports it to her anxious mistress, offering, at the same
time, to kill Octavia during the night. This horrifies Cleopatra, who sternly reproves
her. At last she decides to send a secret messenger to C&aelig;sar's camp, and the
<hi rend="italic">Act</hi> ends. In the next <hi rend="italic">Act,</hi> while waiting for the result of Octavia's intercession with
Octavius, Antony and Cleopatra have a stormy scene. Cleopatra asserts that Antony
had committed her fate to C&aelig;sar. This Antony denies, and says that Rome, through
the Senate on its oath, had for ever renounced all claim to Cleopatra's throne.

<quote><sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Much longed for chance! forsooth my bliss is boundless!</l>
<l>Yet, Sir, to whom must I ascribe this bliss?</l>
<l>To Rome? Octavia? To C&aelig;sar? or to thee?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Thou triflest, Queen!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> <stage>[with angry earnestness.]</stage> Resolve me then my doubts!</l>
<l>Whose is the saving arm that, out of pity,</l>
<l>Maintains me on my throne ancestral?</l>
<l>To whom do I owe thanks for this, my crown!</l>
<l>Is't not Octavia? is it not her charms,</l>
<l>Whose power,&mdash;to win thee from me,&mdash;won Rome's grace?</l>
<l>Did not a single tear, shed at thy feet,</l>
<l>Nay but a single sigh, dissolve the bond
<pb n="550"/></l>
<l>That knit us firm together, up till now,</l>
<l>And place within the power of my foe</l>
<l>My fate, my fame, and all my happiness?</l>
<l>This, <hi rend="italic">this,</hi> ingrate, shalt thou explain to me.</l></sp></quote>
</p>
<p>Antony complains that Octavia would not have persuaded him, had Cleopatra said
but a word or given a hint. She again breaks forth,

<quote><l>A word, a hint from me!&mdash;to rouse thy duty?</l>
<l>Traitor! shewed she not to thee thine inmost heart?</l>
<l>Could I believe thy faith so weakly grounded?</l>
<l>And to Octavia's tongue must I submit,</l>
<l>And blush at every word, confess my fear,</l>
<l>And by my lowness make her triumph greater?</l>
<l>So low no power shall ever make me bow!</l>
<l>Let them, thou brute, deprive me of my throne.</l>
<l>One thing remains, my honour is my own</l>
<l>And should this pride, this day involve my death</l>
<l>The thought of but one weakness makes me rue:&mdash;</l>
<l>That, O barbarian, I have lived for you!</l></quote>
</p>
<p>Antony exclaims that this is beyond endurance and that Octavia shall at once
return, alone, to Rome, all thought of peace shall be relinquished, and demands that
Cleopatra shall tell him what course to take. She replies,

<quote><l>The work thou hast begun, complete. This, Sir,</l>
<l>Is all that thou canst do. Farewell.</l>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> No, cruel one, before thou goest</l>
<l>Say what for me and thee thou hast resolved.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Thereto must C&aelig;sar first bestow the power.</l>
<l>The one on trial cannot be the judge.</l>
<l>Farewell. <stage>[Exit.</stage></l></sp></quote>
</p>
<p>Antony for a while rages against Cleopatra, but at last recognises that it is really
love for him that makes her jeopardise her throne and her very life. Then he decides
that Octavia is the real cause of all this misery, and resolves never to see her again,
but remain for ever by Cleopatra's side. Lucilius enters, but is so shocked at Antony's
change of heart that he departs in anger. Antony sends after him; when he returns
he so convicts Antony of folly in clinging to Cleopatra that Antony swears never
to see her again until he parts from her for ever. Octavia enters with C&aelig;sar's
letter of assent to Antony's proposition: C&aelig;sar will lay down his power and live as
a private citizen in Epirus; Cleopatra's throne shall be unmolested. The joy of
Antony, Octavia, and the children is unbounded. Cleopatra enters and Antony
endeavours to explain to her the situation and its advantages for all concerned. Cleopatra 
declares that she too has been in correspondence with C&aelig;sar, and hands to
Antony a letter from C&aelig;sar wherein she is told to place no reliance on his agreement 
with Octavia, and that he pledges himself to secure her safety and her throne
if she will send him Antony's head. Octavia, heartbroken over the duplicity of her
treacherous brother, departs with her children and is seen no more. Antony throws
himself at the feet of Cleopatra and with tears acknowledges her magnanimity. He
takes a tender leave of her and departs to plunge into battle with C&aelig;sar. Cleopatra, 
from a tower of her palace, watches the fight and sees Antony's defeat.
Demetrius, whom she had sent for news of Antony's welfare, enters and relates how
Antony, on a false report of Cleopatra's death, had attempted to kill himself, and,
<pb n="551"/></p>
<p>when told by Demetrius that she was alive, had sent her tender messages imploring
her forgiveness. Cleopatra commands Demetrius to bring Antony to her at once,
and bids Charmion fetch the asp. Antony is brought in, borne by soldiers. Both
Cleopatra and Antony implore forgiveness of each other. He begs her to fly, she
protests that life has no more charm for her, but to die with him will be her highest
bliss. Antony dies, and after her first outburst of sorrow Cleopatra exclaims, &lsquo;<quote>I who deeply swore not after thee to live, A proof of my true faith I hasten now
to give.</quote>&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dolabella enters, and, under a feigned weakness and timidity, she extracts from
him the secret that within three days she is to be sent to Rome. Cleopatra gives him
a letter to be delivered to C&aelig;sar. When alone with Charmion, Cleopatra bids her
place a throne near Antony's corpse; she then takes the vase containing the aspic,
lifts the cover, and looking in, says,
<quote><l>Well, little thing! how fixedly thou starest!</l>
<l>Dost think thy hissing can awaken fright? [sorrow!</l>
<l>Here! <stage>[thrusting her arm into the vase.]</stage> Cool thy anger and abate my</l>
<l>It hurts not, Charmion! <stage>[She returns to the corpse.]</stage></l>
<l>Now, my departed friend! for ever we're united.</l>
<l>Now I dare call thee husband,&mdash;myself thy wife.</l>
<l>Nought severs us again; one tomb for both!</l>
<l>This thought alone, for me, can sweeten death.</l></quote>
</p>
<p>She bids Charmion bring her crown and summon all her attendants, who enter
and group themselves about her with the emblems of royalty&mdash;the diadem and
sceptre. She says, aside &lsquo;<quote>What coolness steals so softly through my veins! Is it
the poison? ah, how gentle!</quote>&rsquo;</p>
<p>She tells her attendants that she has remembered them all and that Demetrius
has the gold; even if they are subject to C&aelig;sar they must always retain the freedom 
in their hearts to love and remember her. Dolabella enters and announces the
approach of C&aelig;sar, who, shortly after, enters. Dolabella, in an aside, says to the
queen that she must rise, and not remain seated in C&aelig;sar's presence. She keeps her
seat.

<quote><sp><speaker>C&aelig;sar.</speaker><l> O woeful sight! Unhappy Antony!</l>
<l>Why could I never win thy confidence?</l>
<l>Thy hatred was my grief,&mdash;at last thy ruin!</l>
<l>Unhappy queen! I feel for thy misfortune!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Had our mischance not been thy fortune's germ</l>
<l>I doubt not thou hadst pitied us, Octavius.</l>
<l>But, Sir, unpitied I can bear my sorrow.</l></sp></quote>

C&aelig;sar assures her that he is her friend, and she obtains from him the promise that
she shall be buried in the same tomb with her Antony; C&aelig;sar considers it a trifling
request, he was ready to grant much greater.

<quote><sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> To thee it may be small, to me 'tis great.</l>
<l>Is it no salve in death to be united</l>
<l>To him who was the dearest upon earth?</l>
<l>Ay,&mdash;to that great man, the very last great man</l>
<l>This servile world can ever name with pride?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Dolabella.</speaker><l> <stage>[aside.]</stage> Ah, Cleopatra!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> What! shall I refrain from praising him?</l>
<l>C&aelig;sar himself can witness to his greatness;
<pb n="552"/></l>
<l>To it, forsooth, he owes his happy fortune,</l>
<l>The laurel, which adorns him now, was gathered</l>
<l>For him at Philippi by Antony.</l>
<l>That weighty fight saw C&aelig;sar but preparing,&mdash;</l>
<l>He had a fever then, and could not fight.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>C&aelig;sar.</speaker><l> What insolent derision, thou audacity!</l></sp>

<div2 type="subsection" n="Kleopatra, by Julius, Reichsgraf von Soden"><head><title>Kleopatra</title>, by <name>Julius, Reichsgraf von Soden</name></head>
<p>In 1793 <name type="authority">Julius, Reichsgraf von Soden</name>, published a Tragedy in prose, called
<ref targOrder="U" target="soden-1793"><title>Kleopatra.</title></ref> Whether or not it was ever acted I do not know. In a short <hi rend="italic">Preface</hi>
the author remarks that the subject has been already used by the dramatists of many
nations, and, among them, Shakespeare stands at the head. From his own study
of history the author has been led to believe that full justice has not been done to
the character of Cleopatra, in whom he believed that he discerned &lsquo;a mingling of
coquetry and nobility, of voluptuousness and strength, of weakness, of womanliness,
and of regal freedom, which explained all the apparent contradictions of her acts.&rsquo;
In carrying out this conception I cannot say that I think the author is altogether
successful. The voluptuous tendency in Cleopatra's nature is emphasized, &mdash;indeed,
it is more conspicuous than in any other version with which I am acquainted. I can
perceive no traces in Cleopatra of unusual strength of character, unless it be the
unabashed way in which she unfolds to her maid, Miris, her excellent reasons for
changing from the unsuccessful Antony to the successful C&aelig;sar. Unlike other <soCalled>Versions</soCalled>
<pb n="553"/>
there is no parting Scene between Antony and Cleopatra. Antony's attempt at
suicide is entirely successful; Cleopatra merely hears of his death and applies the
asp only when C&aelig;sar's steps are on the threshold of the pyramid in which she had
taken refuge from Antony, who was seeking to kill her after the desertion to C&aelig;sar
of the Egyptian army.</p>
<p>The foregoing abstract is all that I had intended to give of this version, which,
written in prose, seemed to me to be, in general, of inferior merit. I found, however,
to my amazement, that <name type="authority">Moeller</name> pronounces it &lsquo;<quote>the most noteworthy version in German literature.</quote>&rsquo; In <name type="authority">Moeller's</name> concluding remarks he acknowledges that <name type="authority">von
Soden</name> has not succeeded in making Cleopatra a perfectly consistent character, but
in spite of this he does not hesitate to affirm that &lsquo;<quote>this drama, together with the lyric
effusion of Prince George of Prussia, furnishes the German version of Cleopatra's
tragedy which we can, at this day, read with pleasure.</quote>&rsquo; In deference to this opinion
I now give an ampler abstract. The opening locality is Tarentum, where Octavius
and Antony are feasting each other before Octavius starts on his expedition against
Sextus Pompeius and Antony sets out on the war against the Parthians. The first
Scene lies in Antony's house. Cleopatra enters, accompanied by Miris, her maid,
and is thrilled by the thought that she is really in Antony's home, against the
majestic pillars whereof he may have once leaned, &lsquo;<quote>this floor, lifeless though it be,
has borne the footsteps of the lord of the world, and is proud of it.</quote>&rsquo; (There is a
faint reminiscence of Shakespeare here.) 

<quote>It does not compare with your palace at Alexandria,</quote> says Miris. <quote>Palace!</quote> exclaims Cleopatra, <quote>It was a palace when it
enclosed Antony within its walls. Palace, do I call it? It was a temple, consecrated to love and adorned with all its magic. Ah! when he hung upon my neck,
our souls lost themselves on our lips! Then!&mdash;Isis drew about us a magic circle,
and, sundered from all mortal thoughts, Elysium was in us and about us. Prythee,
Miris, how did I look when C&aelig;sar lay at my feet?</quote>
<quote><sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> Like the goddess, to whom we bring our offerings.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> And I am still Cleopatra?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> Assuredly.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Seest thou wrinkles on this brow? Has time dimmed the glance
which prostrated at my feet the conqueror of the world?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> By no means.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><p> Then have no fear, Miris. Antony is mine! And even if Elysium
has thrown wide its gates, or Orcus opened its abyss for him, with a single smile I
can call him back, and repel the Fates. The powers of Heaven and of Hell cannot
restrain him from me.</p></sp></quote></p>
<p>Miris refers to Octavia. <quote>Silence!</quote> Cleopatra cries, <quote>By heaven! If you value
your life, mention her not again! That humdrum, lackadaisical creature! that
alabaster image of simplicity will be frightened off by a single puff of breath from
my lips. Aha! that breath has wrought mightier wonders. It has dissolved every
nerve of the untamed Antony in love and voluptuousness, and subdued the very
tigers. Antony, he knows what it is! . . . Know then, Miris, a man is only what the
woman makes him. It is woman alone who can evoke this headlong rush of the
blood, this all-embracing flight of the imagination,&mdash;the sole source of great and
exalted deeds. This Antony, Miris, this fearful Colossus, Antony, who covers half
the world with his shadow,&mdash;by all the gods, dear Miris, when, asleep in my arms,
I bind him to the bedposts</quote> [a feeble attempt to imitate the teasings of Shakespeare's
Cleopatra], <quote>and then when he awakes, slip away from the sulky hero, with a laugh,
<pb n="554"/>
&mdash;if this poor world, whose lord he is, could see him then, what do you suppose it
would think of its fettered demi-god?</quote>
<quote><sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> Poor, poor Antony!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Hush! not even the gods themselves dare hear the secrets of women.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> You are then resolved&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> To take him back to Alexandria with me.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> Why then do you not appear as Cleopatra?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> No, Miris, no. The sheen of purple dries up the tears of pity, and
freezes compassion. All alone, unadorned, with dishevelled hair, like a bride whose
wild war has engulfed the bridegroom, I will appear before him,&mdash;like an orphaned
one will I embrace his feet,&mdash;with hot tears bedew his warlike thoughts and melt
his wildness into voluptuousness.</l></sp></quote>
</p>
<p>They hear Antony coming and <hi rend="italic">Exeunt.</hi></p>
<p>In the next five Scenes Antony learns that Sextus Pompeius is dead and that
Lepidus is arrested; he thereupon vents his rage on Octavius, whom he now hates.
&lsquo;<quote>I hate his eye,</quote>&rsquo; he exclaims (and it is one of the best sayings in the play), &lsquo;<quote>I hate
his eye; in it I see myself,&mdash;and I'll not be doubled! A second self is too much
for me!</quote>&rsquo; Octavia labours hard to effect a reconciliation between her brother and
her husband and is at last successful. These are among the best Scenes of the play,
if not the very best. The contrast between Octavius's sedate temperament and
Antony's headlong, blustering violence, yet honest withal, is well kept up. Indeed,
in my opinion Antony is the best character in the play, which, with advantage, might
have been called <hi rend="italic">Antonius,</hi> instead of &lsquo;Cleopatra.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With the kisses of his wife and the words, &lsquo;<quote>Farewell, my sweet Octavia!</quote>&rsquo; still
on his lips, Antony meets Cleopatra. He is astounded at seeing her in Tarentum;
she at once taxes him with treachery and desertion. &lsquo;<quote>Who was it,</quote>&rsquo; she bursts
forth, &lsquo;<quote>that in the delicious intoxication of love swore never, never to desert me?
Who? Hast thou forgotten, thou faithless man! the moments when our souls lingered 
on our wounded lips, when heavenly fire shot through every fibre, and glorified
our beings, and, bathed in this sea of beneficent flames&mdash;hah, Elysium itself cannot
outweigh a single moment of such existence!</quote>
<quote><sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Refrain, Cleopatra! refrain! the memory makes me quiver!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> To think that inexorable time has power over such delights! that the
impression of such feelings can vanish like a dream!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Do me not wrong, Cleopatra.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> No Antony! Thou art more or less than mortal, in that thou canst
forget such feelings. Were I immortal and should lose myself in eternity, they would
be my sole thought. Antony has treated me cruelly. Thou divine Isis, and all ye
heavenly hosts, bear me witness how wholly I gave myself to this man; throughout
the whole broad world I felt, saw, heard nothing but him! Every breath I drew, I
counted lost that did not expire on his lips.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Thou dear, dear, beloved one!</l></sp></quote>&rsquo;</p>
<p>Antony is on the point of yielding when Ventidius enters and summons him to
the camp; he is about to obey when Cleopatra makes one last and desperate appeal
to him.

<quote><sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Cleopatra, what dost thou demand?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Dear, beloved idol of my soul, what in this wide world can I wish
for, demand, long for but thee? but thyself?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Sorceress! omnipotent Sorceress! whither would'st thou lead me?
<pb n="555"/></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> To these arms, open to thee alone, to this bosom, to be pressed alone
to thine, to these lips that glow alone for thee!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> So be it!</l></sp></quote>
</p>
<p>Antony breaks off all negotiations with C&aelig;sar and follows Cleopatra to Alexandria. 
C&aelig;sar stirs up the Senate to declare war on Antony by setting forth Antony's
prodigality in giving away provinces and cities, and by his treatment of Octavia.
We have then a wild scene of revelry in the Palace of Cleopatra. Before Antony
has slept off his drunken debauch, Ventidius comes to announce that C&aelig;sar with his
army is at hand. He finally arouses Antony and inspires him with wonted warlike
fury. Actium is fought and the battle lost. Antony's despair and humiliation are,
as in all other versions, profound. Again, as in former Scenes, his character is well
sustained. Cleopatra attempts to console him and so far succeeds that she gains his
consent to send a message to Octavius.

<quote><sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> A wise man bends before the storm and, safe in port, awaits a more
favourable hour. Thy name is still formidable enough&mdash;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> to frighten children to hide behind their mother's apron?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l>&mdash;to obtain from C&aelig;sar an advantageous arrangement. Perhaps he will
let me remain in Egypt, and permit you to retire to private life.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> &ldquo;Permit?&rdquo; This word forces blood out at my eyes!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Only this once! Oh, only this once! Listen to thy loved one!&mdash;
Like the soft whispers of zephyrs the rest of thy life will glide away! My devotion
shall infuse new strength and life into thy veins. Far from the dangers of a hero's
path thou shalt repose on my breast, and from my lips thou shalt drink oblivion; I
will only live, only breathe for thee.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> In vain do I close my ears. The magic of thy voice dissolves my whole
being in love.</l></sp></quote>
</p>
<p>Of course Antony is won; as soon as Cleopatra is alone she murmurs: &lsquo;<quote>What a
pitiful creature a conquered man is! Cleopatra! Cleopatra! Dost thou still really
love this shadow of an Antony? Ah, how high above him towers the young, powerful 
C&aelig;sar! No, no, it was Antony that I loved, and Antony is now no more!</quote>&rsquo;</p>
<p>Antony meets Ventidius and by him is again inspired with martial ardour, and
with the hope that by attacking C&aelig;sar he can regain his lost honour. A battle is
fought; at the end of the day Antony is victorious and returns triumphant to Cleopatra, 
who has a laurel wreath ready for him. In the midst of their rejoicing word
is brought that C&aelig;sar is advancing to a fresh attack. In the meantime Cleopatra has
received a secret messenger from C&aelig;sar, and while Antony is absent, renewing his
fight with C&aelig;sar, she thus reveals her treachery to Miris:

<quote><sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> C&aelig;sar sent that offer to you?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Ay, indeed, and more too, if I would only deliver Antony up to him.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> Did you promise it?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> We're not yet fully agreed. But just one glance of mine, a single smile
of mock-modesty cast backward over the shoulder will bring this conqueror of the
world prostrate at my feet.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> And Antony?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Antony?&mdash;Alas! Antony is no longer Antony.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> No longer? To whom thou sworest eternal fidelity? Thy terrestrial god?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> That was Antony, the fortunate Antony; the conqueror of half the world,
feared from sunrise to sunset, in all the splendour of the highest earthly height!
<pb n="556"/></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> Alas! it is the same Antony whom thou lovedst!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Miris, Miris, love is the favourite of Fortune. Suppose she deserts him?
Fortune, with her all-powerful wheel, rolls everything up and down, excepting only me.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> Pardon me, queen, love accepts the man, without any accidental splendour. Thou hast never loved him.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> By the immortals! I have; but love, like Fortune, has its caprices.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> Poor Antony!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> That is just it! No, no, Cleopatra was not made to be the <foreign lang="la">inamorata</foreign> of
a common mortal.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> Thou wilt leave him then?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Is it my fault, if Fortune has left him? . . . Dost thou not understand my plans?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> What wilt thou do with C&aelig;sar?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><p> The fate of his father and of Antony awaits him. When the world
becomes too small for these rapacious Romans; when, in the course of their restless
ambition, they crush nations, and the immeasurable universe offers no limit to their
rapacity,&mdash;then it is Cleopatra who sets a limit to them. Here the wild conqueror
lays down his arms; his haughty soul becomes entangled in the shifting web of love
and luxury, with all its secret, and infinitely varying delights, which I weave about
him, sometimes with a sparing, sometimes with a lavish hand; his greatness vanishes,
his energy slumbers, he sinks to the level of the common herd. And such a triumph!
by the immortal Isis, I would not exchange it for one of C&aelig;sar's fairest victories!</p></sp></quote>
</p>
<p>Euphronius enters and adjures Cleopatra to fly. Antony has been defeated and
is on his way hither, more raging than the &lsquo;Hyrcanian tiger&rsquo; in his threats of vengeance 
against the queen, who at once takes to flight and escapes. When Ventidius
has succeeded somewhat in calming Antony, he brings forward Octavia and Antony's
children. Reconciliation and forgiveness rule the hour. Cleopatra, with Miris, has
betaken herself to her Monument, and, knowing that she cannot appease Antony in
his present mood, confides to Miris that she will send him word that she is dead,
whereupon he will come to the Monument in deepest grief, and she, &lsquo;<quote>blooming, even
in the grave, with all those charms which were so dangerous to him, will sink into
his arms, and, with glowing kisses, steal forgiveness from his lips.</quote>&rsquo; Euphronius
brings word that Octavia is in Alexandria and is reconciled to Antony. A Scene
here follows which is a weak, very weak, imitation of Shakespeare's Scene of Cleopatra 
and the slave who brings word that Antony is married to Octavia. When the
tempest, such as it is, subsides, Euphronius is sent to announce Cleopatra's death to
Antony, who is just finishing a highly moral discourse to his children on the wickedness 
of women, as Euphronius enters. After Euphronius retires, the manner of
Antony's death is the same as in Plutarch. Euphronius returns to Cleopatra and
reports Antony's despair when he announced her death to him. Cleopatra's exultation 
at this proof that Antony still loves her is boundless; all her love for Antony
revives in tenfold force, and she revels in the thought of meeting him again. This
&lsquo;lightning before death,&rsquo; as it were, is well conceived.</p>
<p>As soon as Euphronius is gone, Cleopatra breaks forth to Miris:

<quote><sp><l>He loves me! Antonius still loves me! Did he not say &ldquo;despair&rdquo;?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> So I heard it.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Ay, <emph>despair</emph>! A frightful word, but to me so sweet! Did he not
speak of dejection?
<pb n="557"/></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mir.</speaker><l> Yes, indeed.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Dejection is the twin-sister of love! Love feeds dejection, and dejection
feeds love.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mir.</speaker><l> I heard of frenzy also.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Didst hear it! Frenzy! O this boundary line of passion is merely the
highest step of love, the very summit of earthly joy.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mir.</speaker><l> And all this, Queen?&mdash;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Whither leads it? O short-sighted girl!&mdash;Do you not know that Antonius
will hasten hither? Hither! to gaze for the last time on the remains of his Cleopatra?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mir.</speaker><l> And then?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Then? Then? O Miris, the gods themselves cannot appreciate the bliss
of such a meeting!</l></sp></quote>
</p>
<p>Word is brought that Antony has killed himself; Cleopatra drives from her presence 
the luckless messenger, of whom she demands to know if &lsquo;<quote>he has not sucked
up every misfortune in nature, like a poisonous sponge, only to squeeze it out over
her.</quote>&rsquo; Miris brings the asp in a basket of flowers; Cleopatra apostrophises the
spirit of Antony; she will &lsquo;<quote>cross the floods of eternity, as a queen, to him, and by
her noble death appease him. But how,</quote>&rsquo; she exclaims, &lsquo;<quote>if I should not find him?
What if this presentiment of another meeting,&mdash;this powerful yearning for a reunion,&mdash;were 
a mere phantom? a fancy of the heated imagination? an intoxication
of the soul, such as follows a goblet of Falernian?</quote>&rsquo; When C&aelig;sar's feet are almost
on the threshold of the monument Cleopatra applies the asp to her breast:

<quote><sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> It is done! Drain, thou most faithful of my subjects, drain every drop
of blood which still clogs the free soul.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> Woe's me! Woe's me!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> <stage>[sinking into her arms.]</stage> Peace! peace!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> Canst thou leave me thus?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Follow!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Miris.</speaker><l> Woe's me!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> My fetters&mdash;C&aelig;sar's fetters! Antony! Farewell, Miris!&mdash;Farewell!

<div2 type="subsection" n="Octavia, by August von Kotzebue"><head><title>Octavia</title>, by <name>August von Kotzebue</name></head>
<p>In 1801 there appeared a tragedy, called <ref targOrder="U" target="kotzebue-1801"><title>Octavia,</title> by <name type="authority">August von Kotzebue</name></ref>.
In a <hi rend="italic">Preface</hi> the auther says that for a long time it seemed to him impossible to
harmonise the many contradictions in the character of Cleopatra. At last he came
to the conclusion that the cause of the evil, from which her actions sprang, lay in the
extremest sensual <hi rend="italic">egoismus.</hi> It was <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> which led to her first meeting with Antony.
She had been sternly commanded to give an account of the help she had bestowed
on Cassius. Her sole safety lay in her charms; she availed herself of them; her
austere judge became her wooer. Antony at this time was at the pinnacle of his
power, without his support her throne would topple; it seemed, therefore, of importance 
that such a conquest should be retained. Added to this, there was an inclination 
to voluptuousness and debauchery. <hi rend="italic">Fear, Power,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Licentiousness</hi> were,
therefore, the only ties which bound this impure soul to the hero. Naturally, as soon
as these sources of control weakened, or even threatened to weaken, she must be
ready on the instant to sacrifice her lover. Thus she showed it in her flight at Actium;
thus, also, in her treacherous dealings with C&aelig;sar; thus finally in the devilish fiction
concerning her death, in order to lead Antony to suicide. As an offset to the blackness
<pb n="558"/>
of her soul, should her heroic death be urged, and the tears shed on Antony's
corpse, it must be borne in mind that those tears and that death were only the
necessary consequence of C&aelig;sar's inexorable will and invincible indifference to her
charms.</p>
<p>From clay thus sordid and foul it is hardly to be expected that the dramatist
should mould a gracious figure. And, indeed, in the motley group of the Cleopatras
who live their little day in the dramatic world, <name type="authority">Kotzebue's</name> Egyptian Queen is eminent 
as the most deceitful, the most selfish, and the least attractive of them all.</p>
<p>Octavia, with her two children, braves the journey to Alexandria, pleads with her
brother for peace with Antony, and, after a promise from him of reconciliation, ventures 
into Cleopatra's very palace and there pleads with Antony; just as she has
won him, and she and Antony with their two children are all mingling tears of joy,
Cleopatra enters, gazes for a while, unseen, on the group, comprehends it all, and
rushes with a dagger at Octavia. Antony seizes her arm in time, and the curtain
falls, with Cleopatra casting furious glances at Octavia and struggling in Antony's
grasp while Octavia gazes at her with pride, compassion, and scorn. The curtain
rises again on the same Scene. Of course Cleopatra has fainted, and of course
Antony thinks she is dead. But she revives, recalls the past scene, thanks Antony
for having prevented her from hurting that noblest of Roman women, whom she
now recognises and of whom she implores forgiveness. Antony pronounces them
both to be the noblest of women, whose kindred souls nature intended to be united
in sisterly love. &lsquo;<quote>Embrace,</quote>&rsquo; he cries, &lsquo;<quote>hand in hand and breast to breast! let me
feast my eyes on the divine sight.</quote>&rsquo; &lsquo;<quote>Dare I venture?</quote>&rsquo; asks Cleopatra, timidly.
Octavia says, aside, &lsquo;<quote>Be still my heart, 'tis for the sake of peace,</quote>&rsquo; and then aloud,
&lsquo;<quote>Come hither; be thy friendly embrace a pledge for the future!</quote>&rsquo; They embrace,
and Antony folds them both in his arms! There they both coo for some time while
he beams down on them, enraptured. At last Cleopatra begs to be excused in order
to provide some refreshment for Octavia. At this repast she offers to Octavia a
friendly cup, which is dashed from her hand by Ventidius who has, shortly before,
intimidated the purveyor of the poison into a confession of the plot. Antony drags
Cleopatra aside, and to him she confesses that it was love for him that prompted her
to the act, and so cajoles him that he dashes from her presence to go and fight a
duel with C&aelig;sar. He leaves the unfortunate Octavia and his children in the power
of Cleopatra, after having asseverated to the Egyptian queen, with a most solemn
oath, that her life would answer for theirs. After his departure Cleopatra drives
Octavia from the palace with the grossest insults, but retains the children, who are,
however, shortly rescued by Eros and restored to their mother. To get rid of
Antony, whom she now hates, and to prepare the way to subjugate C&aelig;sar with her
charms, Cleopatra decides on making Antony commit suicide, which she is sure he
will do, should he hear that she was dead. Under instructions from her, Charmion
tells Antony with befitting outcries and lamentations that Cleopatra has drowned
herself in the Nile. Antony obligingly fulfills Cleopatra's anticipations, and, after
stabbing himself, expires in the arms of Octavia and of his weeping children. Of
Cleopatra's ultimate fate we have no knowledge.

Dr <name type="authority">Moeller</name> was the first, I believe, to unwrap the anonimity of the author
of this version (that it was a kindness may be doubted), by finding, in the copy
<pb n="559"/>
belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale,</hi> a letter, addressed to the printer of the
play, signed &lsquo;S. D. Morgues.&rsquo; In his <hi rend="italic">Preface</hi> the author tells us that he has long
observed that the dramas presented on the stage are not lively enough with song and
dance, and that the audience yawns over them. The following tragedy is supposed
to correct this defect. To show us how ebullient is his Muse, and how he lisps in
numbers and the numbers come, and how competent he is to enliven a tragedy,
throughout five of the thirteen pages of his <hi rend="italic">Preface,</hi> he caracoles in verse. The
setting of the stage for the <hi rend="italic">First Act</hi> and Scene will give some idea of the capacity
of Citoyen <name type="authority">Morgues</name> to carry out his plan: &lsquo;<quote>The Theatre represents a gallery or hall
of the palace, decorated with everything magnificent or voluptuous that the imagination 
can conceive. On the side scenes are pictures of the loves of Mars and Venus
and many mirrors. At the back is a superb throne, enriched with precious stones,
where Cleopatra, as Venus, is seated, with Love as a young child at her side. The
Ambassadors of neighboring kings, each in his national costume, grandees, officers
of State, stand, according to their rank, on the steps of the throne. The rest of the
scene is filled with Loves, Graces, the Pleasures, etc.</quote>&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cleopatra is awaiting the arrival of Antony, and this gay scene has been devised
to raise his spirits, sadly depressed since the battle of Actium. Nymphs sing of his
warlike prowess, he enters, is overwhelmed with the brilliancy of the scene and the
ravishing beauty of Cleopatra, and is about to refer to the disgrace of Actium when
the queen interrupts, announcing that the whole day is to be given up to delight, and
commands the Nymphs, Pleasures, Graces, Loves to bind the hero captive with the
chains of Cytherea. Hereupon follow several pages of a &lsquo;Song,&rsquo; composed of such
stanzas as the following:

<cit><quote><lg><l>Our springtime resembles these roses,</l>
<l>Which have but a day of delight,</l>
<l>The sun all their beauty discloses,</l>
<l>But they die with the advent of night.</l></lg><lg><l>So then, while old Time is still flying,</l>
<l>Let us seize all his joys as they pass,</l>
<l>And with raptures, each other outvying,</l>
<l>Find delight in each grain in his glass.</l></lg></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="morgues-1803">&mdash;p. 21.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Under the influence of such sparkling and novel strains, what eye can droop,
or head incline to yawn! But quips and cranks and wanton wiles cannot last for
ever. Lucilius breaks in and the charm is snapt. From here to the end of the
play Plutarch's fine direct prose is converted, or perverted, into dull rhyming
couplets. There are, however, some episodes. After hearing the false report of
Cleopatra's death Antony becomes frantic. The Shades of the victims of his past
cruelty appear, especially Cicero, and he apostrophises them with horror. Another
notable divergence from Plutarch, for which we must give Citoyen <name type="authority">Morgues</name> all
credit, is the ingenious excuse whereby Cleopatra eludes the vigilance of Octavius
himself, and escapes from his very presence in order to compass her own death and
thereby thwart his plans. Her device, which cannot fail to appeal to the female
heart, is thus contrived: the incident of Seleucus and the false brief has just closed
(but very tamely, in comparison with <name type="authority">Jodelle</name>) when Cleopatra exclaims:

<cit><quote><l>Ye gods! and have I lost all sense of shame?</l>
<l>Thus dressed, to venture in the gaze of men?
<pb n="560"/></l>
<l>Woe's me! my fatal sorrows are the cause.</l>
<l>Disgrace has plunged me to the lowest depths.</l>
<l>All things, e'en shame, are dead within my soul!</l>
<l>'Tis too degrading thus to blush 'fore C&aelig;sar!</l>
<l>I can no longer bear his steady gaze.</l>
<l>Permit me, Sir, to leave you for a minute,</l>
<l>My garments' plight enforces my retirement.</l>
<l>Allow me hence to go to re-arrange them.</l>
<l>I'll presently return, and show myself</l>
<l>More nobly vestured, and, perhaps, more worthy</l>
<l>A queen disgraced, who blushes at her state.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="morgues-1803">&mdash;p. 99.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>These are the last words we hear from her. When next we behold her she is a
corpse, magnificently attired, with Iras dead by her side. Charmian is dying, but,
evidently with a soul prophetic of the future dispute over the mode of Cleopatra's death,
refuses to commit herself by telling Octavius how or from what cause her mistress died.

<name type="authority">Soumet</name> were highly popular, but that the present one was a decided failure, which
is conceivable if the standard be the attractiveness of the characters. Cleopatra is
selfish and treacherous. Octavius, also, is treachery itself; after professions of fraternal
love to Antony and of fidelity to Cleopatra, he confides to Proculeius that both are
destined for the Tarpeian Rock. Antony is the least repellent of the three, but even
he, as in a majority of these <hi rend="italic">Versions,</hi> is as weak as he is foolish. It cannot be surprising, 
therefore, that in spite of the dignity of the style and the goodness of the
construction, the play was a failure.</p>
<p>Cleopatra appears in the First Scene and strikes the chord which is to vibrate in
the last. In obedience to her commands sundry deadly poisons, an envenomed dagger, 
and the asps stand ready for use on a funeral altar in the interior of a pyramid
whither she has betaken herself after the battle of Actium. In a conversation with
her attendant, Th&eacute;one, Cleopatra reveals her treachery and tells of a secret treaty
which she has made with Octavius, whom she hopes soon to see at her feet. Proculeius, 
the envoy of Octavius, enters and announces to Cleopatra that his master
will make her queen of all the East if she will surrender Antony to him. She refuses
with scorn to be an assassin and, having always at hand the means of killing herself,
bids Proculeius tell C&aelig;sar that she awaits his arrival at this sepulchre with a dagger
in her hand. Proculeius departs. Antony enters, having, to the astonishment of
Cleopatra, recovered from the delirium of shame into which the loss of Actium had
plunged him. His self-accusations in having been, instead of a victorious emperor,
merely Cleopatra's lover, and the laughing stock of the universe, sting Cleopatra into
indignant rage and she scornfully asks him why he does not at once go over to
the Roman camp:
<pb n="561"/>

<cit><quote><l>'Tis not the hour thus to speak to me.</l>
<l>If after all, so dearly you love Rome,</l>
<l>Why do you not, forsooth, at once betake</l>
<l>Yourself to C&aelig;sar? his camp is close at hand.</l>
<l>You'll thus escape the weary bonds which bind you.</l>
<l>Perhaps the Romans are awaiting you?</l>
<l>Nay and perchance your trembling wife, Octavia,</l>
<l>Will there, among them all, protect you, Sir;</l>
<l>And lictors improvise a noble escort;</l>
<l>Desert! desert! these fatal halls of death!</l>
<l>My guards stand ready to conduct your steps.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="soumet-1825">&mdash;p. 13.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Antony declines and asserts that even now he intends to conquer C&aelig;sar; he has
friends and soldiers enough to protect Alexandria and Cleopatra. This intention of
fighting for her softens Cleopatra's heart, and the <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> closes with a reconciliation.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Second Act</hi> opens with a conversation between Antony and Eros in which,
as in Cleopatra's case, we have an anticipation of tragedy,&mdash;Antony reminds Eros of
his promise to kill him, should he demand it. A conference between Antony and
Octavius follows in which there are mutual recriminations and a general airing of all
complaints. C&aelig;sar represents the cause of absolute monarchy, while Antony is the
advocate of freedom against tyranny, and each harangues his warriors from his own
point of view. C&aelig;sar denounces Antony as a rebel and Antony denounces C&aelig;sar
as a tyrant. The conference is broken up by the entrance of Octavia, who utters her
sad complaints and adjures Antony to return to the path of virtue and to Rome.
But her husband listens coldly, until at last Octavius plays a well-devised stroke by
producing the secret treaty made with Octavius by Cleopatra. Hardly has Antony
finished reading it, when Cleopatra herself is announced. Antony taxes her with
her treachery, but she defends herself as having done everything solely with a view to
his protection. She confessed to having made a treaty with Rome, but had broken it
when she found it was to be sealed with his blood. Goaded to madness she turns on
Octavia with the declaration that for herself she had sacrificed to Antony all her
fleet, her treasure, her armies, her estates, and all her subjects, merely to uphold his
rights; while in return, he it was who now devised her impending ruin, and at the
words &lsquo;<quote>your plottings&mdash;&mdash;</quote>&rsquo; Antony interrupts and tells her to respect Octavia's
mourning weeds[!], and, proclaiming Octavia to be a model of virtue, asserts that no
one shall insult her in his presence; then commanding his wife to follow him, he goes
out with the words, &lsquo;I blush for myself, but I am proud of Octavia.&rsquo; Cleopatra, left
alone, bewails her fate, but finds comfort, not only in having defeated all hopes of a
treaty between Antony and C&aelig;sar, but also in the command which she is about to
issue to her army to renew the battle. She gives one dark hint: &lsquo;<quote>If some day this
steel in the blood of Octavia&mdash;Therefor I am hoping&mdash;.</quote>&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Third Act</hi> opens while the battle is raging, and Cleopatra, with Th&eacute;one, is
awaiting news of the issue. Brooding over the way in which Antony has left her,
she says,

<cit><quote><l>Perhaps this triumph, which I so desire,</l>
<l>Will prove the worst misfortune of my life.</l>
<l>And Cleopatra, at this fatal moment,</l>
<l>Can breathe no prayer,&mdash;not even for her lover.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="soumet-1825">&mdash;p. 35.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Phorbas enters, describes Antony's victory, and how he had obtained from the
priests a precious frontlet which only the queens of Egypt were allowed to wear;
<pb n="562"/>
Phorbas adds, that, according to rumour, this frontlet was destined for Octavia.
Amid the transports of rage into which Cleopatra falls on hearing this, she throws
out another dark hint that if she must descend from her throne she will first bathe it
in blood. In the next Scene Antony confides to Eros that the frontlet is destined for
the Egyptian queen; he will repudiate Octavia and marry Cleopatra, amid general
rejoicings and festivities; he is proud, he says, to bear her yoke, and his only wish is
to bring the haughty Romans to her feet. Cleopatra enters and greets Antony with
ironical congratulations on his approaching festivity, to which she says she has
invited a few other guests,&mdash;certain witnesses whom he does not expect.

<quote><l>In crowning her,</l></quote> she asks, 
<quote><l>whom you so deeply love</l>
<l>Will no remorse arise to vex your soul?</l>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> I know how much this day will bring of sorrow;</l>
<l>But&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> 'Twill see the flow of far more blood than tears.</l>
<l>This festal day is not yet finished, monster!</l>
<l>Didst thou suppose that my quiescent hatred</l>
<l>Would suffer thee to compass my dishonour?</l>
<l>Thou'lt see that I can yet avenge my crown.</l>
<l>My throne in falling will o'erwhelm thee too.</l></sp></quote>
</p>
<p>Antony is thunderstruck and asks what means this frightful misunderstanding,
and asserts that he is for ever separated from Octavia, and hopes at the altar of the
immortal gods to marry Cleopatra, the sole object of his idolatry. On hearing these
words, a pallor overspreads Cleopatra's features. At that instant Eros rushes in with
the news that treachery has opened the gates of Alexandria and that the Romans are
even now at the very doors of the palace. Cleopatra confesses that, prompted by
black jealousy, the treachery is hers, and implores Antony to kill her as a punishment, 
and also to save her from C&aelig;sar, from Rome, and from herself. Antony leaves
her with the bitter hope that her treachery will be successful, and her path to power
re-opened when the conqueror greets her, bearing in his hand Antony's head. When
alone, Cleopatra bewails, not so much the loss of her crown, as of Antony, and resolves
that she will seek the camp of C&aelig;sar; if she once find lodgement there, it will prove
fatal to him; then, by his death, Antony may regain power.</p>
<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Fourth Act</hi> Antony has in vain sought death in battle, and, when Eros
enters and announces that Octavia is approaching, he commands Eros to kill him,
and just as he is about to obey, Octavia enters; she pleads with him and finally
brings forward his son, Marcellus, who does not know that Antony is his father, but
tells how proud he is of him and of his valour, until at last Antony breaks down,
reveals himself to his son, and expresses astonishment at finding the voice of nature
awaken in his heart; he obeys the voice, and folds Octavia and Marcellus in his arms.
Cleopatra has an interview with Octavius in which she temptingly sets before him
the grandeur of a vast empire which he could found, with Alexandria as a Capital.
Octavius asks if he could possibly &lsquo;<quote>abandon Rome and its glorious walls?</quote>&rsquo; Cleopatra 
replies that &lsquo;<quote>Rome makes heroes, but Egypt makes gods.</quote>&rsquo; Octavius in turn
invites Cleopatra to go to Rome with him and there unfold the grandeur of her vast
projects. She assents, after saying in an aside, &lsquo;<quote>Tremble, imprudent young man!</quote>&rsquo;
The <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> closes with Octavius's words to Proculeius, in reference to Cleopatra and
Antony, that the Tarpeian Rock awaits its two victims.</p>
<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Fifth Act</hi> (which takes place within a Pyramid) Cleopatra has discovered
<pb n="563"/>
Octavius's treachery, and that he intends to take her as a captive to Rome, where,
as she tells Th&eacute;one, she will be

<quote><l>Exposed to all the insults of the mob</l>
<l>And lictors will exhibit for a penny,</l>
<l>The queen of Egypt, as a show, in chains!</l></quote>

(Wherein we have a possible reminiscence of Shakespeare.) She expresses her
hatred of Octavia, and decides that Phorbas shall lure her hither and contrive her
death. Octavia, with Marcellus, enters the Pyramid in search of Antony; she bids
the young boy await her while she explores the passage down which Cleopatra has
just disappeared. The lad hears piercing screams; Cleopatra immediately enters
with the reeking steel yet in her hand and bids him fly, which he does, shrieking for
his father to avenge his mother's murder. A sudden, unexpected, and inexpressible
horror seizes Cleopatra, she feels that her hour is come, and thrusts her arm into a
vase where lie the asps.

<cit><quote><l>'Tis done! and now can Fate no further harm me!</l>
<l>To mock Octavius and all his cruelty,</l>
<l>I've sent this poison speeding through my veins</l>
<l>Come hither, tyrant! here thou shalt find proof</l>
<l>That I need none to teach me how to die.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="soumet-1825">&mdash;p. 72.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Phorbas enters and tells how Antony has stabbed himself and is even now
approaching to behold Cleopatra once more before he breathes his last. Antony
enters, Cleopatra tells him that poison already invades her heart. Antony doubts.
She appeals to her pallor.

<quote><sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> 'Tis death,&mdash;I see 'tis done,&mdash; 'tis death, indeed.</l>

<div2 type="subsection" n="Cl&eacute;opatre, by &Eacute;mile de Girardin (Delphine Gay)"><head><title>Cl&eacute;opatre</title>, by <name>&Eacute;mile de Girardin</name> (<name>Delphine Gay</name>)</head>
<p><ref targOrder="U" target="girardin-1860a"><title>Cl&eacute;opatre</title> was written for Mademoiselle <name type="authority">Rachel</name> by Madame <name type="authority">&Eacute;mile de
Girardin</name> (<name type="authority">Delphine Gay</name>)</ref>, and acted for the first time in 1847.</p>
<p>The play opens before the battle of Actium (which is unusual in these <hi rend="italic">Versions</hi>);
Ventidius, Antony's closest friend, is sent to Cleopatra to call her to account for
having given aid and comfort to Brutus. In Cleopatra's palace Ventidius meets Diomedes, 
Cleopatra's secretary, and the two have a long and friendly conference, which
reveals to each that they have in view the same end, namely, to keep Antony from
falling into the toils of the Egyptian queen, on the one hand, and Egypt from falling
under the dominion of Cleopatra's lover, on the other. It is, dramatically, a skilful
opening; opportunity is afforded to Diomedes to unfold Cleopatra's character, and to
Ventidius to unfold Antony's. Diomedes describes his queen's invincible charm of
manner, which disarms all hate and impels instant forgiveness for all misdeeds; she
is always a queen, and always a woman; in her frail frame is discerned a great soul,
and royalty amidst her weakness. Thus she goes from crime to crime,
<quote><l><foreign lang="fr">Bravant impun&eacute;ment et le peuple et la cour,</foreign></l>
<l><foreign lang="fr">Ne m&eacute;ritant que haine et n'inspirant qu'amour.</foreign></l></quote>
</p>
<p>In the description of her love of luxury and pleasure we find what is perhaps the
nearest approach to &lsquo;custom cannot stale her infinite variety&rsquo; where Diomedes says,
<quote><l><foreign lang="fr">Ce bruit, ce mouvement d'une &eacute;ternelle f&ecirc;te,</foreign></l>
<l><foreign lang="fr">Tourbillon de plaisir qui jamais ne s'arr&ecirc;te.</foreign></l></quote>
</p>
<p>To this ambitious, unprincipled, luxurious character, Ventidius describes Antony's
as an exact counterpart. Some plan must be devised, therefore, of controlling Antony
and of converting his love for Cleopatra into jealousy and hate, should it threaten to
overmaster him. An instrument to carry out this plan is found in an Egyptian Slave.
This young Slave, as handsome as an Apollo, had fallen wildly in love with Cleopatra, 
who, in an hour of <hi rend="italic">ennui,</hi> had deigned to look on him, and listen to the
delirious protestations of his adoration; when at last he exclaimed, &lsquo;<quote>Give me death,
<pb n="565"/>
if you will, for one moment of love!</quote>&rsquo; she had bestowed on him a smile of assent.
&lsquo;<quote>Poison and the Nile,</quote>&rsquo; concludes Diomedes, &lsquo;<quote>will this day end the disgraceful amour.</quote>&rsquo;
Just as Ventidius discerns the drift of Diomedes and exclaims, &lsquo;<quote>Marc Antony is
jealous . . . If, rescuing this slave . . . </quote>&rsquo; the interview is broken off by the approach
of some one, and the Scene ends.</p>
<p>In the next Scene Charmion appears, bearing a goblet of foaming liquor, a new
and deadly poison just received from Thrace, as she explains to Iras, which, as it is
now dawn, the young Slave must quaff and &lsquo;<quote>pay with his life for a moment of bliss.</quote>&rsquo;
The young Slave enters and joyously demands the goblet which Charmion hands
to him; whereupon, in some impassioned verses, he apostrophises Night, which is
about to envelop him, and Death, which he welcomes:

<quote><l><foreign lang="fr">Je suis pr&ecirc;t &agrave; partir pour les rivages sombres;</foreign></l>
<l><foreign lang="fr">Prends mon sang et ma vie et mon jeune avenir.</foreign></l>
<l><foreign lang="fr">Mais permets qu'avec moi j'emporte chez les ombres</foreign></l>
<l part="F"><foreign lang="fr">Le souvenir . . . le souvenir!</foreign></l></quote>
</p>
<p>He lifts the cup, drinks, and falls. On the instant Diomedes rushes in, saying
to Charmion and Iras that the queen is asking for them, and they depart forthwith.
Diomedes is followed by Ventidius and a Leech, who at once takes the young Slave
in hand and by the administration of antidotes recalls him to life.</p>
<p>Thus ends the <hi rend="italic">First Act.</hi> Although neither Antony nor Cleopatra appear in it,
their presence pervades it throughout.</p>
<p>The opening of the <hi rend="italic">Second Act</hi> introduces us to Cleopatra, reclining on a couch;
before her a High Priest, a Philosopher, a Savant, and an Architect. This revelation 
of the intellectual side of Cleopatra's character is to be found in no other
presentation of her with which I am acquainted. She listens to the High Priest
as he expounds the Egyptian religion, and she promises to take part in certain ceremonies; 
she bids the Philosopher admit to the School, Egiras of Samos, a young
student of ability; she exhorts the Architect to hasten the building of the temple
of Hermonthis; and asks the Savant how many new volumes have been added to
the Library to replace those that were burnt, etc. After the departure of this group,
and she is left alone with Iras and Charmion, she tells them how weary she is, waiting 
for Antony, whom the oracles have promised she should see to-day. By a subtle
and Shakespearian touch, which I am afraid was suggested by <name type="authority">Theophile Gautier's</name>
<title><hi rend="italic">Une Nuit de Cl&eacute;opatre,</hi></title> this weariness is attributed to everything about her, the earth
and sky, the people and the climate. &lsquo;<quote>Oh!</quote>&rsquo; she exclaims, &lsquo;<quote>how slowly pass the
weary hours! And how depressing is this breezeless heat!</quote>

<cit><quote><l>With no cool cloud in skies for ever clear,</l>
<l>No tear of moisture in the unpitying blue!</l>
<l>The skies have never winter, spring, nor fall;</l>
<l>There's nought to change their dazzling monotone.</l>
<l>And on the desert's verge there hangs the sun,</l>
<l>A huge and blood-red eye for ever open.</l>
<l>This constant brilliance tires my dreaming soul.</l>
<l>Could I but see a single drop of rain</l>
<l>I'd give these pearls, this carcanet, my Iras.</l>
<l>Ah! life in Egypt is a heavy burthen!</l>
<l>No, this rich land, so justly celebrated,</l>
<l>For me, young queen, is but a realm of death.</l>
<l>They vaunt its palaces, its monuments,
<pb n="566"/></l>
<l>But what excite most wonder are but tombs.</l>
<l>Where'er one treads, one knows there sleep beneath</l>
<l>The rigid mummies of long ages past.</l>
<l>Call it a land of murder and remorse.</l>
<l>The living toil but to embalm the dead. . . .</l>
<l>Here's nought but what to me is odious;</l>
<l>All, e'en its beauties, fill me with affright,</l>
<l>Ay, e'en its famous stream, with course unknown,</l>
<l>Whose head is sought in vain, three thousand years.</l>
<l>Its very blessing seems like a misfortune,</l>
<l>Because the sombre secret of its richness</l>
<l>Lies not within the sun's gift, nor a star's.</l>
<l>This fruitfulness is born of a disaster.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="girardin-1860a">p. 152.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>To raise Cleopatra's spirits Charmion and Iras recall the splendour of the voyage
on the Cydnus, and rehearse the description, as given in Plutarch. Anthony enters
in disguise, accompanied by Ventidius and Diomedes, and listens with delight to
Cleopatra's expressions of disappointment at his failure to appear. At last he reveals
himself and explains his disguise as due to the secrecy which attends a meeting at
the harbour for the purpose of concluding a treaty. Cleopatra implores him to remain;
he is about to yield, when Ventidius whispers to him, &lsquo;The Slave is there; are you
no longer jealous?&rsquo; &lsquo;The Slave!&rsquo; gasps Antony, aside, &lsquo;that one word re-awakes
my rage.&rsquo; And he hurries precipitately away.</p>
<p>Cleopatra mistrusts Antony's &lsquo;treaty&rsquo; and believes that he is deceiving her. While
she is in a balcony, watching the departing ships, the Slave, from below, shoots up
to her an arrow bearing the message that Antony is treacherous, is become friends
with C&aelig;sar, and has left for Rome, to marry Octavia. This resuscitated Slave,
through whom Diomedes and Ventidius believed that they could always awaken
Antony's jealousy (and as we have just seen, successfully), and who, they hoped, would
prove an implacable foe to Cleopatra, remains, in reality, the queen's idolater, and
becomes her devoted guardian; in the very last Scene of all it is he who, in mercy,
brings the asp in the basket of figs. Cleopatra learns from Diomedes that Octavia
is beautiful and charming; she thereupon decides that, disguised as a Greek slave,
with Diomedes and Iras as her sole companions, she will go to Tarentum and
see for herself. She arrives there and is enabled to overhear an interview between
C&aelig;sar and his sister, Octavia, when the latter will not allow C&aelig;sar to utter one word
in derogation of Antony's love for her. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; says C&aelig;sar, &lsquo;he insults both you
and me&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;I feel no insult,&rsquo; cries Octavia,
<cit><quote><l>'Tis in his courage that his virtue lies!</l>
<l>A hero's love, so properly applauded,</l>
<l>Is cheaply bought by some few bitter tears.</l>
<l>What matters Cleopatra,&mdash;nay, any mistress?</l>
<l>He loves them but in moments of delirium.</l>
<l>When reason rallies, I am his delight,</l>
<l>'Tis I whom he then seeks in his chaste home,</l>
<l>To me is all his future dedicated.</l>
<l>'Tis I whom he respects,&mdash;and women envy.</l>
<l>'Tis mine alone to follow, and wait on him</l>
<l>Without a blush and fearless of a witness . . . .</l>
<l>Thou seest, brother, that my lot is fairest!</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="girardin-1860a">p. 173.</ref>
</bibl></cit>
<pb n="567"/></p>
<p>When the conference is at an end, C&aelig;sar retires by one door and Octavia is about
to retire by another, when Cleopatra rushes forth with the cry that &lsquo;her punishment
has been too long and that she is dying.&rsquo; Iras flies to her assistance; Octavia,
who does not, of course, know who she is, pauses with kindly interest and recommends 
her own Greek physician. Cleopatra gives orders to Diomedes for her immediate 
return to Alexandria, and in a long soliloquy confesses the power which
Octavia &lsquo;possesses in her conscious chastity,&rsquo; &lsquo;that grand word which for the first
time she comprehends,&mdash;that grand word, <hi rend="italic">virtue,</hi> which rings so loud.

<cit><quote><l>This noble dame, oblivious of vengeance,</l>
<l>Appeared to me to be indeed sublime.</l>
<l>My better nature could esteem her greatness;</l>
<l>I loved her bearing of high purity.</l>
<l>I envied her calm front and stern regard . . . .</l>
<l>O Brutus! virtue's not an empty name!</l>
<l>'Tis not a lie, a false illusion,&mdash;No!</l>
<l>'Tis an authority, a boundless force,&mdash;</l>
<l>'Tis the first step where royalty begins!</l>
<l>It is a precious gift, a treasure all divine!</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="girardin-1860a">p. 177.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>All the blame of her past follies she lays on the African sun that sent its own
hot fire through her youthful veins. But for this fiery god she would have known
love in its purity, and beneath her crown she would have had a loyal and stainless
brow, and given to Octavia gaze for gaze.</p>
<p>In the meantime Antony, his love for Cleopatra having revived with full force,
breaks loose from Ventidius and discovers Cleopatra, just as she is about to leave
Tarentum. Vows of mutual love are renewed and they agree to meet again at
Actium.</p>
<p>When the <hi rend="italic">Fourth Act</hi> opens, the battle of Actium has been fought, and Antony is
the victim of abysmal despair, from which he is, however, aroused by the devotion of
his soldiers, led on by an old, scarred veteran named Faustus. Cleopatra approaches,
and is at first repelled, but she throws herself on her knees at Antony's feet and,
taking upon herself all the blame of the defeat, begs to be forgiven. She then goes
on to describe the delirium of excitement in which she entered on the battle. She
saw Antony in his dazzling gold armour and heard his voice; he seemed a being
from another sphere, so terrible, so grand was he. She had no thought of fear; she
stood on her vessel's prow with flowing hair, her limbs of brass and her soul of fire;
she quaffed healths to Neptune, to Jupiter, to Mars, and flung the golden goblets in
the deep. She heard the shrieks, the whistling of the javelins, and saw the blue
waves with blood incarnadined. The scene was too horrible for one of even her
regal race,&mdash;her reason tottered; when, of a sudden, a soldier fell wounded on the
deck and his blood rushed forth in great gushes. She drew near,&mdash;O Gods! he
resembled Antony! In an instant all was forgotten, pride, glory, history, fame;
one thought dominated all others: to save Antony's life. She gave the signal to
retreat and knew that Antony would obey it:

<quote><l><foreign lang="fr">Et quand je t'ai revu, quand je t'ai retrouv&eacute;,</foreign></l>
<l><foreign lang="fr">Je n'ai pas dit: J'ai fui . . . . j'ai dit: Je t'ai sauv&eacute;!</foreign></l></quote>
</p>
<p>Of course Antony forgives her and folds her in his arms, with a reminiscence of
Shakespeare, as he says &lsquo;<quote><foreign lang="fr">L'Empire ne vaut pas une larme de toi.</foreign></quote>&rsquo; A new life is
breathed into him and he calls for his armour, but even in that moment he confesses
to Cleopatra that his sole enemy is mistrust, yes, mistrust. The faintest suspicion of
<pb n="568"/>
a mistrust of her, and the world with all its ambitions fades from him. At this instant
Ventidius appears and announces that all Cleopatra's army has deserted to C&aelig;sar;
and that there is a secret treaty whereby Antony, also, is to be delivered to the conqueror. 
Instantly Antony's mistrust flares up into certainty; he tears himself away
from Cleopatra, bidding her &lsquo;<quote>Weep! groan!&mdash;I know now the value of thy tears.</quote>&rsquo;
Hardly had he left her, and given directions to his soldiers, when the Slave enters
and tells him that Cleopatra is dead. His response is &lsquo;<quote>Run to those soldiers, tell
them&mdash;Antony is about to die! Dead! she loved me then, and I maligned
her!</quote>&rsquo; He commands Faustus to kill him; the story of Eros is repeated from
Plutarch.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Fifth Act</hi> discovers Antony dying on a couch in the Hall of the Tombs of the
Ptolemies. His prayer that he may die in Cleopatra's arms is granted. Cleopatra
bewails her loss, reiterating her boundless love for him and beseeching Isis to lead
her to him. Charmion says, &lsquo;<quote>Death's pallor now is creeping o'er his face. Let us
invoke him thrice as it is done in Rome.</quote>&rsquo;</p>
<p>She calls, &lsquo;<quote>Antony!</quote>&rsquo; Cleopatra calls, &lsquo;<quote>Antony!</quote>&rsquo; But the third call is uttered
by Octavia, who enters unexpectedly. She is no longer the calm woman of aforetime, 
but she rails at Cleopatra; acknowledges her hate, and hopes to live to see the
Egyptian queen her slave and bound to the triumphal chariot of Octavius.</p>
<p>The drama now comes swiftly to a close. While Cleopatra is rehearsing the bitter 
fate which will compel her to enter Rome in C&aelig;sar's triumph, the Slave enters
bearing a basket of fruit, and, prostrating himself before the queen, says to her, aside,
&lsquo;<quote>Rome awaits thee, thou wilt leave this evening, unless, preferring a quick and noble
death&mdash;Hast fear of death?</quote>
<quote><sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> I?&mdash;I fear the shame. A poniard?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Slave.</speaker><l> A poniard! These surly guards at sight of any blow thou'dst give thyself,

<p><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="everett-1905">Dr <name type="authority">William Everett</name> (<hi rend="italic">The Atlantic Monthly,</hi> February, 1905)</ref></bibl>, thus praises
Mad. <name type="authority">de Girardin's</name> tragedy:

<quote>The play is written with great force and beauty of expression, and deserves no
inferior place among those we are discussing. It could hardly help being superior
to Alfieri's boyish effort,&mdash;but it has more dignity than <title>The False One,</title> with less
appearance of being hurried for the stage; the scope and field is wider than <title>All for
Love,</title> and <title>le grand Corneille</title> must confess his brilliant countrywoman excels him in
manliness. . . . The radical defect, to Saxon taste, is the spirit of declamation that
dominates situation and poetry. Ventidius, Diomedes, the Slave, Antony, C&aelig;sar,
Octavius, Cleopatra, all have to develop their feelings in long tirades&mdash;<title>le recit de
Th&eacute;ramene.</title> One does not question that Rachel and her coadjutors could have given
them with immense spirit and feeling; one feels that the point and wit of the French
language is here elevated to a dignity worthy of Bossuet and Vergniaud. But in
<title>Antony and Cleopatra</title> there is not a single speech twenty lines long; the rhetoric
which, in <title>Coriolanus,</title> in <title>Julius C&aelig;sar,</title> in <title>Henry V.,</title> in <title>Henry VIII.,</title> unless that is
Fletcher's, throws all Corneille and Racine into the shade, is laid aside for fear it
should mar the dramatic perfection of the character and incidents.</quote>

<div2 type="subsection" n="Antony and Cleopatra, by Walter Savage Landor"><head><title>Antony and Cleopatra</title>, by <name>Walter Savage Landor</name></head>
<p><name type="authority">Walter Savage Landor</name> has entitled one of his inimitable <title>Dialogues in Verse,</title>
<title>Antony and Cleopatra;</title> it consists of Twelve Scenes wherein appear about the same
number of Shakespeare's chief characters; but they are Shakespeare's characters only
in name, nor are they the characters of Plutarch. The fire of Shakespeare's Cleopatra 
is subdued to a pure, unwavering glow, exquisitely radiant with love for Antony
and for her children. Antony's turbulence has vanished; he is the calm, highsouled, 
broken-hearted, classic hero. The story of the asps is treated as mere
gossip. Cleopatra dies of the poison contained in a ruby ring which Antony gives
her (in the Scene here reprinted). Her death is not described; she sends the empty
ring to Antony; he understands that she has taken the poison and is dead; he
thereupon kills himself. C&aelig;sarion is endowed with every charm of a young boy
just verging on manhood, and his cruel death, commanded by Octavius, under the
stabs of Scopas's dagger, is harrowing; without being similar, there is about the Scene
of his death, an indefinable reminiscence of the Scene between Arthur and Hubert.
Only those Scenes wherein Cleopatra appears are here reprinted.

<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> What demon urged thy flight?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> The demon Love.</l>
<l>I am a woman, with a woman's fears,</l>
<l>A mother's, and, alas O Antony!</l>
<l>More fears than these.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Of whom?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Ask not <hi rend="italic">of</hi> whom</l>
<l>But ask <hi rend="italic">for</hi> whom, if thou must ask at all,</l>
<l>Nor knowest nor hast known. Yes, I did fear</l>
<l>For my own life . . . ah! lies it not in thine?</l>
<l>How many perils compast thee around!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> What are the perils that are strange to me?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Mine thou couldst not have seen when swiftest oars,</l>
<l>Attracted by the throne and canopy,</l>
<l>Pounced at me only, numerous as the waves;</l>
<l>Couldst not have seen my maidens throwing down</l>
<l>Their fans and posies (piteous to behold!)</l>
<l>That they might wring their hands more readily.</l>
<l>I was too faint myself to still their cries.</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Antony</hi> <stage>[aside.]</stage> I almost thought her blameable</l>
<l><stage>[To Cleopatra.]</stage> The Gods</l>
<l>So will'd it. Thou despondest . . . too aware</l>
<l>The day is lost.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> The day may have been lost,</l>
<l>But other days, and happier ones, will come.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Never: when those so high once fall, their weight</l>
<l>Keeps them for ever down.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Talk reasonably,</l>
<l>And love me as . . . til now . . . it should be more,</l>
<l>For love and sorrow mingle where they meet.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> It shall be more. Are these last kisses cold?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Nor cold are they nor shall they be the last.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Promise me, Cleopatra, one thing more.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> 'Tis promist, and now tell me what it is.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Rememberest thou this ring?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Dost thou remember</l>
<l>The day, my Antony, when it was given?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Day happiest in a life of many happy,</l>
<l>And all thy gift.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> 'Tis call'd the richest ruby,</l>
<l>The heaviest, and the deepest, in the world.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> The richest certainly.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> And not the deepest</l>
<l>And broadest? Look! it hides all this large nail,
<pb n="572"/></l>
<l>And mine are long ones if not very wide;</l>
<l>Now let me see if it don't cover yours</l>
<l>As wide again! there! it would cover two.</l>
<l>Why smile you so?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Because I know its story.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Ha! then you have not lost all memory quite.</l>
<l>I told it you. The king of Pontus sent it</l>
<l>When dying to my father, warning him</l>
<l>By letter that there was a charm in it</l>
<l>Not to be trifled with.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> It shall not be.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> But tell me now the promise I must make;</l>
<l>What has the ring to do with it?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> All, all.</l>
<l>Know, Cleopatra, this is not one ruby.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> The value then is smaller.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Say not so,</l>
<l>Remark the rim.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> The gold is thin, I see.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> And seest thou it will open? It contains</l>
<l>Another jewel richer than itself.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Impossible! my Antony! for rubies</l>
<l>Are richer than all other gems on earth.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Now, my sweet trifler, for thy promise.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Speak.</l>
<l>By all the Powers above and all below,</l>
<l>I will perform thy bidding, even to death.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> To death it goes; not until after mine.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> I kiss the precious charm. Methinks an odor</l>
<l>Of almond comes from it. How sweet the flower</l>
<l>Of death!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> 'Tis painless death, 'tis sudden too.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Who could wish more, even were there more to wish?</l>
<l>With us there is not.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> Generous, pious girl!</l>
<l>Daughter of Ptolemies! thou hast not won</l>
<l>A lower man than they. Thy name shall rise</l>
<l>Above the pyramids, above the stars,</l>
<l>Nations yet wild shall that name civilize,</l>
<l>And glorious poets shake their theaters,</l>
<l>And stagger kings and emperors with applause.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> I was not born to die; but I was born</l>
<l>To leave the world with Antony, and will.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Antony.</speaker><l> The greatest of all eastern kings died thus,</l>
<l>The greater than all eastern kings thus died.</l>
<l>O glorious forgeman who couldst rivet down</l>
<l>Refractory crowds by thousands, and make quake</l>
<l>Scepters like reeds! we want not here thy voice</l>

<sp><speaker>Charmian.</speaker><l> I was afraid,</l>
<l>Never so in my life; he lookt so fierce</l>
<l>He fear'd his own wild eyes, he placed one hand</l>

<sp><speaker>Iras.</speaker><l> The kindest.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Ah! no doubt! but what were they?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Iras.</speaker><l> He said, The loveliest creature in the world . . .</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> The vulgar brute! Our ferrymen talk so:</l>
<l>And couldst thou listen, Iras, to such speech?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Iras.</speaker><l> Only when people praise our gracious queen.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Me? this of me? Thou didst thy duty, child:</l>

<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Is there</l>

<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> He must be tenderer than I fancied him</l>

<sp><speaker>Charmian.</speaker><l> Half the guards</l>
<l>And half the ministers of state have shown</l>
<l>Signs of his bounty to the other half.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleopatra.</speaker><l> Gifts are poor signs of bounty. Do not slaves</l>
<l>Slip off the gold-black pouches from their necks</l>
<l>Untied but to buy other slaves therewith?</l>
<l>Do not tame creatures lure into the trap</l>

<p><ref targOrder="U" target="conrad-1877"><title>Cleopatra, A Tragedy in one Act,</title> by <name type="authority">G. Conrad</name></ref> (a name assumed, according to
<name type="authority">Moeller</name>, by Prince <name type="authority">George</name> of Prussia, of whom I know nothing further), appeared
in 1868. It is in three Scenes; the first two are skilfully devised to introduce the
third and most important. In the first a dialogue between Iras and Charmion, who
bears a covered basket of flowers wherein lie the asps, sets forth the resolution of
the queen to die, and gives occasion to describe the past glories of the voyage on
the Cydnus, their brilliant feasts, Antony's death, and Cleopatra's bearing toward
Augustus. In the second we have an ardent love-scene beween the queen and Dolabella, 
wherein the latter is the impassioned lover. As a proof of his devotion, he
divulges the secret that Augustus is resolved to lead the queen in triumph in Rome,
for which Dolabella hates him and implores Cleopatra to fly with himself to some
paradise, where, amid perfume and flowers, raptures and delight, intoxicated with
transports, they can lose and forget the world. The queen promises to give him an
answer before the night is over, and calls him her &lsquo;beloved one&rsquo; as, at the approach
of Augustus, she bids him a hurried farewell. In the third Scene Augustus enters,
cold, distant, and haughty. In the dialogue which follows we find that Augustus
represents patriotism, the prosaic, sterner virtues, and simplicity, not unalloyed with
severity and over-weening ambition; Cleopatra represents the poesy of life, the joyousness 
of art, of love, of sensuous delights, the artist's vision and the poet's dream.
The Egyptian queen invites her Roman conqueror to enter this world of happiness
which all are struggling to attain. The Spartan virtues are no longer practised;
renunciation and submission are a weariness. But Augustus turns a deaf ear to all
her allurements and asserts that &lsquo;<quote>undeterred he will pursue his aims.</quote>&rsquo; Thereupon
Cleopatra replies:

<quote><sp><l>But trust in me, and thou shalt still be happy.</l>
<l>Before thee shall unfold an unknown life,</l>
<l>So full, so fair, like nothing else on earth,</l>
<l>Where every pain, and every care is hushed;</l>

<l>Must I e'en follow thee to Rome? I'm ready.</l>
<l>Thou dost not shake thy head. Dare I then hope? . . .</l>

</p>
<p>Augustus was stirred more deeply than Cleopatra imagined. He confesses that
for the first time he now understands her and perceives her hatred of all hypocritcial
pretence. Her charms of mind and person have subdued him. He will seek her
and be to her as a divinity bringing consolation and blessing. He draws the curtain 
before an inner room and discovers Cleopatra lying lifeless on her couch with
Iras and Charmian dead beside her. Dolabella rushes in, and, uttering frantic cries
of grief and horror, falls prostrate before the queen's couch. Augustus tries to calm
him, and, to soothe him, promises a future of unequaled glory in Rome. Dolabella
leaps to his feet and curses Augustus and Rome, who crush all happiness into the
dust; then turning to Cleopatra's corpse with the words,

<quote><l>Only by thee were happiness and life!</l>
<l>Thou diest,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;and a world is lost in thee!</l></quote>

stabs himself. &lsquo;<quote>A world!</quote>&rsquo; Augustus utters with pain, and the Curtain falls.</p>
<p>As this is one of the latest, it is also one of the best of these <hi rend="italic">Versions.</hi> The
inevitable fate of Poesy, to be crushed in any collision with the prosaic world of Fact,
that awakes too late to find what it has lost, is finely conceived, while the despair of
Youth at the deathbed of Poetry completes the brilliant picture.

<div2 type="subsection" n="Antony and Cleopatra, by Franz Dingelstedt"><head><title>Antony and Cleopatra</title>, by <name>Franz Dingelstedt</name></head>
<p>In 1878 the first performance was given of a version, by <ref targOrder="U" target="dingelstedt-1879"><name type="authority">Franz Dingelstedt</name>, of
Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra;</hi></ref> it bore the announcement that it was &lsquo;freely
translated and re-arranged.&rsquo; There are sundry omissions, combinations, re-arrangements, 
and trifling additions to smoothe away gaps as far as what, in the version, is
Act IV, Scene ii, whereof the Scene is laid in &lsquo;Antony's Palace in Athens;&rsquo; it
is after the battle of Actium; Antony enters, uttering the soliloquy, &lsquo;<quote>Hearke, the
Land bids me tread no more upon't,</quote>&rsquo; and shortly after, Cleopatra approaches timidly,
in an attempt at reconciliation. Thus far <name type="authority">Dingelstedt's</name> drama might be leniently
termed a version. From this point onward, I fear, it can be termed with truth only
a perversion. Antony is no longer the same character whom we have learned to
admire and pity, and although he says that Cleopatra's beck might from the bidding
of the gods command him, the words have really no meaning; he shows forthwith
that her full supremacy is gone, and that he loves himself far more than he loves her.
The same change is apparent in Cleopatra. Two brief sentences of impatient rage
suffice with her to dethrone the demi-Atlas of the earth and make her resolve to
throw herself on the protection of Octavius and abandon Antony to his fate. The
transformation Scene is as follows: When Cleopatra says, &lsquo;<quote>Oh, my lord! my lord!
Forgive my fearful sails, I little thought you would have followed them,</quote>&rsquo; Antony
springs up, and raging above the kneeling Cleopatra, utters, &lsquo;<quote>Thou knew'st too well,
vicious <foreign lang="de">[unselig]</foreign> woman, That my heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings, And
thou should'st tow me after,</quote>&rsquo; etc. Cleopatra throws her arms about him, pleading
&lsquo;<quote>Forgive, forgive;</quote>&rsquo; and sobs aloud on his breast, whereupon Antony bursts forth,

<quote><l>What? Tears? Treacherous tears!</l>
<l>Like those shed by the crocodile of thy Nile!

<pb n="581"/>
</l>
<l>Away, thou venom'd boa-constrictor! <foreign lang="de">[K&ouml;nigsschlange]</foreign></l>
<l>I'll tear me free from thine embracing coils</l>
<l>Before thou sting'st me! Away! Away, I say! 
<stage>[He dashes out. Eros follows. Cleopatra collapses. But after a pause, she arises, and with a
demoniac expression of face, gazes scornfully after Antony, thereby disclosing 
the growth in her mind of her resolve to desert him.</stage></l></quote>
</p>
<p>When, in the next Scene, Antony orders Thyreus to be taken away and whipped,
&lsquo;<quote>Cleopatra wrings her hands,</quote>&rsquo; and when Antony continues to storm against her, she
interrupts with, &lsquo;<quote>This, to me! darest thou&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</quote>&rsquo; &lsquo;<quote>Forsooth, this is enough!</quote>&rsquo; as
she utters this latter exclamation she advances passionately toward Antony.&rsquo; Alexas,
Charmian, and Iras interpose with &lsquo;<quote>O Queen!</quote>&rsquo;

<cit><quote><sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Back! and dare not to interpose yourselves</l>
<l>Betwixt that man and me! <stage>[Then in crushing tones to Ant.]</stage></l>
<l> And who, pray, then art thou?</l>
<l>That art so high and mighty,&mdash;and to me!&mdash;</l>
<l>That dar'st reproach me with disgrace and shame!&mdash;</l>
<l>Thou, sunk and lost in deep dishonour! <stage>[Ant. collapses on a couch.</stage></l>
<l>I am a queen! But thou art less than nothing!</l>
<l>Where now, Triumvir, bides thy host, thy fleet?</l>
<l>Where, pattern of a husband, is thy wife?</l>
<l>Speak!</l>
<l>Did'st thou not break thy vows, deep-sworn to me,</l>
<l>And, with dishonour, bind thyself afresh</l>
<l>Before from old bonds thou had'st yet been freed?</l>
<l>And now,&mdash;or do I dream it?&mdash;thou would'st leave</l>
<l>Me here deserted, for another's arms,</l>
<l>Betrayed, behind my back, for vile advantage?</l>
<l>What! Thou a man, and let'st the stripling C&aelig;sar</l>
<l>With help of that gross hypocrite, his sister,</l>
<l>Enmesh thee with his stupid clumsy snares,</l>
<l>Which artfully he throws about thy horns.</l>
<l>What! Thou a hero, and, at battle's height,</l>
<l>With victory at hand, thou runn'st away,</l>
<l>Deserting armies, fortune, and thyself,</l>
<l>Because&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;a woman left thee! A Ruler!</l>
<l>Thou! thou, who canst not even rule thy heart!</l>
<l>Thou wretched Roman, learn thou here from me,</l>
<l>A queen from out the thousand-year-old race</l>
<l>Of Ptolemies,&mdash;of Egypt's sacred soil</l>
<l>A worthy daughter,&mdash;learn how death is wooed</l>
<l>When one can live no longer without honour! <stage>[Exit grandly and with a</stage></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> <stage>[beside himself.]</stage> Cleopatra!&mdash;After her!&mdash;But no,&mdash; <stage>commanding air.</stage></l>
<l>Too late! We'll ne'er again be as we were.</l>
<l>And she is right: there's nought remains but&mdash;death.</l></sp></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="dingelstedt-1879">p. 107.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Eros here enters with Thyreus. Antony sends by the latter his personal challenge to C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p>It is not worth while to follow the rest of the version, step by step or Scene by
Scene. C&aelig;sar in his camp before Alexandria tells M&aelig;cenas that on the morrow the
city shall be stormed, if need be; then smilingly adds, &lsquo;<quote>And yet I hardly think it.</quote>
<pb n="582"/>

<cit><quote><l>It is not battering rams, but tender fingers</l>
<l>That will throw open wide the gates for us. <stage>[All regard him enquiringly.</stage></l>
<l>My messenger, whom Antony had whipped,</l>
<l>Has cruelly revenged himself. He stole</l>
<l>The sole thing Antony had left&mdash;Cle&oacute;patra.</l>
<l>She sent us, by Thyreus, full submission</l>
<l>And made an offer of a firm alliance,</l>
<l>For which she asks no further for herself,</l>
<l>Or even for her sons, but Egypt's crown. <stage>[All are astonished.</stage></l>
<l>Well, well, that will come round, of course. Meanwhile</l>
<l>No aid to Antony will she supply;</l>
<l>Nay and perchance she'll give him up to us.</l>
<l>Although we arm, there will not be a battle.</l>
<l>I hope Antonius will be taken prisoner.</l>
<l>He'll prove attractive in our Roman triumph.</l>
<l>His exhibition do I owe my city.</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="dingelstedt-1879">p. 116.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>The Scene changes to Cleopatra's palace. Alexas tells Cleopatra that Antony is
furious against her, and for safety conveys her to the royal Pyramids. Antony enters;
he has been ransacking the palace to find Cleopatra and wreak his vengeance on her,
&mdash;&lsquo;<quote>he is in full armour and beside himself,</quote>&rsquo; and calls:

<cit><quote><l>Where art thou now, Cle&oacute;patra? Thou Fury</l>
<l>Of Hades, where dost keep thyself bestowed?</l>
<l>Triple-turned wanton, I am seeking thee,</l>
<l>To be revenged on thee,&mdash;to punish thee!</l>
<l>On thee alone I now am waging war,&mdash;</l>
<l>A war for life or death! Thy blood, thy warm,</l>
<l>Sweet, treacherous blood, this do I long to quaff!</l></quote><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="dingelstedt-1879">p. 129.</ref></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>There is not an alarming amount of perversion in Eros's suicide, nor in Antony's
attempt to imitate him. As Antony lies in a swoon, Cleopatra rushes in, and with
&lsquo;a piercing shriek,&rsquo; exclaims, &lsquo;<quote>Antonius&mdash;dead?</quote>&rsquo; Her outcry arouses Antony, who
raises himself, and addresses her,

<quote><sp><l>Is't thou, Cle&oacute;patra? Hast thou from Orcus,</l>
<l>Returned to fetch thy dilatory friend?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> No. I'm not dead, and neither shalt thou die!</l>
<l>I'll wake thee back to life, e'en with my kissing.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> <stage>[looking vaguely about, notices Alexas.]</stage> 'Twas he who said just now,</l>
<l>thou'dst killed thyself?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> He lied.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Even here in death, more lies,&mdash;lies,&mdash;lies! <stage>[He turns himself from her in disgust.</stage></l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Oh, would that I had follow'd him! I thought </l>
<l>That I could thus best win my friend again!</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> And therefore die! Behold&mdash;I do not lie,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l>
<l>My death is real. My sight begins to swim,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</l>
<l>Where art thou, Cleopatra?</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Cleop.</speaker><l> Here to beg</l>
<l>Forgiveness on my knees.</l></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ant.</speaker><l> Thou art forgiven . . .</l>
<l>Already much in life I have forgiven thee,</l>
<l>And now . . . in death . . . everything!</l></sp></quote>

<pb n="583"/></p>
<p>Hereupon follows a weak version of Antony's last speech, with omissions and
insignificant additions. The Scene of the <hi rend="italic">Fifth Act</hi> lies inside a pyramid, with
mummies in niches in the walls. Antony's body lies on a catafalque in the middle.
M&aelig;cenas falls desperately in love with Cleopatra; she repels him, but appeals to
him to discover C&aelig;sar's intentions with regard to her future. She learns that she is
to be led in triumph at Rome. All the chief features of her death Scene are preserved, as in Shakespeare.

<p>The present play of <title>Anthony and Cleopatra</title> is barren, indeed, of adequate records
of the few actors and actresses who have performed it. The dates of the revivals
may be found in <name type="authority">Genest</name>. Comments on the revivals themselves are, in the <hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi> 
to the play in <hi rend="italic">Irving's Edition,</hi> set forth as follows:</p>
<p><name type="authority">Joseph Knight</name> <bibl>(ed. Irving, <hi rend="italic">Introduction,</hi> p. 115)</bibl>: Between 1704 and 1706,
according to Downes, four plays, to be acted by the players of both companies&mdash;
Drury Lane and Lincoln's Inn Fields&mdash;were commanded at Court. First among
these was <title>All for Love,</title> in which Betterton appeared as Antony, Verbruggen as Ventidius, 
Wilks as Dolabella, Booth as Alexas, Mrs Barry as Cleopatra, and Mrs Bracegirdle 
as Octavia. Concerning these representations Downes says, with every probability 
of truth in his favour, &lsquo;<quote>These four plays were well acted and gave great satisfaction.</quote>&rsquo; 
On 3rd December, 1718, at Drury Lane, when the management of Cibber, 
Wilks, and Booth was at the height of its good fortune, an important revival
took place. In this Barton Booth was Antony; Mills, Ventidius; Wilks, Dolabella;
Cibber, Alexas; Mrs Oldfield, Cleopatra; and Mrs Porter, Octavia. Concerning this
revival Colley Cibber says, <cit><quote>&lsquo;The habits of that tragedy amounted to an expense of
near six hundred pounds; a sum unheard of for many years before, on the like
occasion&rsquo;</quote><bibl> (<title>Apology,</title> ii, 175, 176, ed. 1889).</bibl></cit>
<note place="inline" anchored="yes"><p>[Of this same revival we also find the following:</p>
<p><cit><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="davies-1785"><name type="authority">Thomas Davies</name> (ii, 370)</ref></bibl><quote><p> In Dryden's <title>All for Love,</title> Booth's dignified action
and forcible elocution, in the part of Antony, attracted the public to that heavy,
though, in many parts, well written play, six nights successively, without the assistance 
of pantomime, or farce, which, at that time, was esteemed something extraordinary. 
But, indeed, he was well supported by an Oldfield, in his Cleopatra, who,
to a most harmonious, powerful voice and fine person, added grace and elegance of
gesture. When Booth and Oldfield met in the Second Act, their dignity of deportment 
commanded the applause and approbation of the most judicious critics. When
Antony said to Cleopatra, &lsquo;<quote>You promised me your silence, and you break it Ere I
have scarce begun,</quote>&rsquo;&mdash;this check was so well understood by Oldfield, and answered
with such propriety of behaviour, that, in Shakespeare's phrase, her &lsquo;<quote>bendings were
adornings.</quote>&rsquo; The elder Mills acted Ventidius with the true spirit of a rough and
generous old soldier. To render the play as acceptable to the public as possible,
Wilkes took the trifling part of Dolabella, nor did Colley Cibber disdain to appear in
Alexas; these parts would scarcely be accepted now by third-rate actors. Still to
add more weight to the performance, Octavia was a short character of a Scene or
two, in which Mrs Porter drew not only respect, but the more affecting approbation
of tears, from the audience. Since that time, <title>All for Love</title> has gradually sunk into
forgetfulness.]</p></quote></cit></p></note> <name type="authority">Knight</name> continues:</p>
<p>While <title>Antony and Cleopatra</title> slept for another seventy years Dryden's play was
<pb n="584"/>
revived at Drury Lane, 22nd Mar., 1766, with Powell as Antony and Mrs Yates
again as Cleopatra; and once more at the same house, still under Garrick's management, 
17th Dec., 1772, with Spranger Barry as Antony, Mrs Barry as Octavia, and
Miss Younge, for the first time, as Cleopatra. On the 28th of the following March,
at Covent Garden, Mrs Hartley, whose first season it was, made her first appearance
as Cleopatra to the Antony of Smith and the Dolabella of Wroughton. With Miss
Younge and Smith in the principal parts <title>All for Love</title> was played at Drury Lane on
12th May, 1775, and 13th March, 1776. With Smith as Antony, and Miss Yates from
Drury Lane as Cleopatra, with West Digges as Ventidius, and Farren as Dolabella,
it was given at Covent Garden 8th Jan., and 5th Feb., 1779.</p>
<p>In Dryden's <title>All for Love,</title> and not in Shakespeare's <title>Antony and Cleopatra,</title> Mrs
Siddons essayed, at Drury Lane, 5th May, 1788, the character of Cleopatra, Kemble
being the Antony; Palmer, Ventidius; Barrymore, Dolabella; and Mrs Ward,
Octavia. That the performance by Mrs Siddons of a character so suited to her
powers was fine may be assumed. Not being in Shakespeare, however, it calls for
no further comment than the statement that <bibl>Boaden (<title>Life of Siddons,</title> ii, 243)</bibl> says
that she showed &lsquo;<quote>the daring atrocity of crime,</quote>&rsquo; and adds, with sub-acid banter, that
&lsquo;<quote>the notion of frailty was visually banished.</quote>&rsquo; <bibl>Campbell (<title>Life of Siddons,</title> ii, 127)</bibl>
suggests that Octavia would under certain conditions have been a better part for the
actress than Cleopatra; and says that &lsquo;<quote>she never established &ldquo;the Siren of the Nile&rdquo;
among her popular characters.</quote>&rsquo; On 24th May, 1790, at Covent Garden, Miss Brunton 
played Cleopatra to the Antony of Holman; and on 12th Jan., 1818, at Bath,
Conway, the unfortunate actor, treated with so much perverse cruelty by Hazlitt and
Theodore Hook, was the Antony to the Cleopatra of Miss Somerville, afterwards
Mrs Bunn. . . .</p>
<p>In November, 1833, Macready produced at Covent Garden an acting version of
<title>Antony and Cleopatra.</title> The great feature of the revival was the scenery by Clarkson 
Stanfield. <note place="inline" anchored="yes">[According to Macready's own diary the revival was not eminently
successful.]</note> . . .</p>
<p><title>Antony and Cleopatra</title> was naturally included in the series of revivals of Shakespeare 
undertaken by the Phelps and Greenwood management at Sadler's Wells. It
was first played 22nd October, 1850, with Phelps as Antony, G. K. Dickinson as
Octavius, Henry Marston as Sextus Pompeius, George Kenrick as Enobarbus, and
Miss Glyn as Cleopatra. This was one of the most successful of the Sadler's Wells
revivals, and elicited much approval. Miss Glyn's performance of Cleopatra was
the crowning triumph of her career. In personal appearance she conformed to the
requirements of Talfourd, namely, &lsquo;<quote>a figure of voluptuous majesty, a mingling of
dazzling beauty and intellectual command.</quote>&rsquo; In her death scene she was pronounced 
equal to Pasta.</p>
<p><cit><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="pascoe-1880"><name type="authority">C. E. Pascoe</name> (<title>Dramatic List,</title> London, 1880, p. 158)</ref></bibl><quote><p> In portraying the
enchantress, <name>Cleopatra,</name> Miss Glyn had occasion to draw upon the entire resources
of her art. The variety and fascination of the character she touched to admiration.
The caprice, the grace, the pride of the character were exhibited with a power which
exceeded expectation. It was evident that she had made a profound and industrious
study of the part. The whole portrait was thrown out with decision and force, and
richly coloured. Those parts in which dignity and anger were expressed&mdash;such as
the interview with the messenger after Antony's second marriage&mdash;were given with
a vehemence and power corresponding to the language she had to deliver. But it
<pb n="585"/>
was in the <hi rend="italic">Fifth Act,</hi> when preparing for her death, that the better phases of the
character and the more refined parts of the action tested the fitness of the actress for
this assumption. Indignant majesty, compulsory resignation, heroic resolve, and
tender memory, were all adequately pronounced. The death itself was a triumph.

and vigorous, but old-fashioned; Miss Wallis's qualifications for Cleopatra
did not extend beyond good looks and some elocutionary ability, and the production

<p>In the <title>Textual Notes</title> on the preceding pages, the various readings of this <hi rend="italic">Version,</hi>
where they decidedly differ from <name type="authority">Capell's</name> own text, are duly recorded. To avoid
confusion I have designated this <hi rend="italic">Version</hi> as <name type="authority">Garrick's</name>, abbreviated &lsquo;Gar.&rsquo; It has
received the following notices:</p>
<p><cit><bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="davies-1785"><name type="authority">T. Davies</name> (ii, 369)</ref></bibl><quote><p> <title>Antony and Cleopatra</title> had long lain dormant, I believe ever
since it was first exhibited, when, about the year 1760, Mr Garrick, from his passionate 
desire to give the public as much of their admired poet as possible, revived it, as
altered by Mr Capell, with all the advantages of new scenes, habits, and other decorations 
proper to the play. However, it did not answer his own and the public
expectation. It must be confessed, that, in Antony, he wanted one necessary accomplishment: 
his person was not sufficiently important and commanding to represent
the part. There is more dignity of action than variety of passion in the character,
though it is not deficient in the latter. The actor, who is obliged continually to
traverse the stage, should from person attract respect, as well as from the power of
speech. Mrs Yates was then a young actress, and had not manifested such proofs
of genius, and such admirable elocution, as she has since displayed: but her fine
figure and pleasing manner of speaking were well adapted to the enchanting Cleopatra. 
Mossop wanted the essential part of Enobarbus, humour.</p></quote></cit></p>

times, was adapted to the stage by abridging and transposing only,&mdash;Capell's alteration 
is judicious on the whole, but might have been better,&mdash;for the convenience of
representation it was right to reduce the number of characters, but this is done without 
any regard to propriety&mdash;the speech with which Philo opens the play, and the
famous description of Cleopatra on the Cydnus (taken from Enobarbus) are given to
Thyre&uuml;s&mdash;if a change were to be made it should certainly have been made in favour
of some Roman of consequence on Antony's side, not in favour of Thyre&uuml;s, who was
C&aelig;sar's freedman, and who had never seen Cleopatra till he was sent with a message
to her, as in the <hi rend="italic">Third Act</hi> of the play,&mdash;what the Soldier and Scarus say in the
<hi rend="italic">Third</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fourth Acts</hi> is absurdly given to Diomedes, who was only Secretary to
Cleopatra and could have nothing to do with military concerns&mdash;in the <hi rend="italic">Second Act</hi>
Antony says&mdash;&lsquo;If we compose well here, to Parthia: &ldquo;Hark you Ventidius.&rdquo; &rsquo; Capell
has changed the name to Canidius, which was wrong, as Ventidius was the person
really sent to oppose the Parthians. Garrick revived this play with all the advantages
of new scenes, habits, and decorations, but it did not answer his expectation&mdash;his own
person was not sufficiently important for Antony; and Mrs Yates had not perhaps at
this time displayed abilities equal to the representation of Shakspeare's best female
character, Lady Macbeth excepted.</p></quote></cit>

fault appears to have been principally attributable to the actors, that this long-deferred
production of [Capell's Version] was not a success. After half a dozen repetitions
the piece was withdrawn. Why Garrick should not have been a good Antony is not
easily seen. He was not, however, Mrs Yates, meanwhile, though popular as
Lady Macbeth, won little recognition in other important female characters of Shakespeare, 
and made no impression as Cleopatra. Few of Garrick's revivals attracted
less attention. Davies and Murphy in their biographies leave it unmentioned. Dr
Doran, without advancing any authority, speaks of it as the great event of its season,
and says, with what almost sounds like disingenuousness, but is only carelessness, that
Garrick and Mrs Yates gained &lsquo;even more laurels as Zamti and Mandane in the
Orphan of China&rsquo; than in Antony and Cleopatra, in which they gained none at all.

<div2 n="Version Attributed to Kemble" type="subsection"><head>VERSION ATTRIBUTED TO KEMBLE</head>
<p>In 1813 there appeared <name>Shakspeare's</name> <hi rend="italic">Tragedy of</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">Antony</hi> <hi rend="italic">and</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">Cleopatra</hi>;
<hi rend="italic">with alterations, and with additions from</hi> <name>Dryden</name>; <hi rend="italic">as now perform'd at the</hi> <name>Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden</name>. 
Mr Abbot appeared as Octavius; Mr Young as Antony;
Mr Barrymore as Lepidus; Mr Egerton as Enobarbus; Mrs Faucit as Cleopatra;
Miss Cooke and Mrs Watts as Charmion and Iras; Mrs M'Gibbon as Octavia. The
object of the Compiler of this <hi rend="italic">Version</hi> (who is said to have been <name type="authority">Kemble</name>, but without 
sufficient foundation) is set forth in an &lsquo;Advertisement,&rsquo; prefixed to the Text;
very briefly stated, this object appears to have been to weld into one play the beauties
of Shakespeare's <title>Anthony and Cleopatra</title> and of Dryden's <title>All for Love,</title> after having
eliminated from the former the features which tend to render it unacceptable to the
public, and from the latter those weaknesses that have caused it to decline in popularity, 
or, in short, as the author expresses it, &lsquo;an amalgamation of wonderful poetical
powers.&rsquo; The various readings, transpositions, and additions have not been recorded
in the <title>Textual Notes</title> on the preceding pages of this volume; within a space so
restricted it would have been impossible to render them intelligible. In place
thereof a description of this &lsquo;amalgamation&rsquo; is here given which will convey an
idea of the <hi rend="italic">Version,</hi> as a whole, far more clearly than can be conveyed by any <title>Textual
Notes.</title> This description is by <name type="authority">Genest</name>. (I happen to have Genest's own copy and
almost every page bears witness to the fidelity with which he performed his task.)
It is found in his <bibl><ref targOrder="U" target="genest-1832">vol. viii, p. 417, <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi></ref></bibl> as follows:
<quote><p>&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">First Act</hi> does not differ materially from the original [<hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> Shakespeare's] &mdash;
Modena and Charmi<emph>a</emph>n are properly changed to Mutina and Charmi<emph>o</emph>n&mdash;but Mar<emph>k</emph>
Antony should have been altered to Mar<emph>c</emph> Antony, as in the bill&mdash;the letter <mentioned>k</mentioned> in a
Roman name is an unpardonable solecism. <hi rend="italic">Second Act,</hi> begins with Shakespeare's
Second Scene, but the conclusion of it, in which Enobarbus describes Cleopatra on
the Cydnus, is most injudiciously omitted&mdash;Capell has transposed it&mdash;then follows
Shakespeare's Fifth Scene with Cleopatra and her attendants&mdash;next comes an unimportant 
Scene between Antony and Octavia at Athens&mdash;this is from Shakespeare's
<hi rend="italic">Third Act</hi>&mdash;Cleopatra, etc., are discovered <hi rend="italic">at Alexandria</hi>&mdash;the first part of this Scene
is chiefly from Shakespeare, but when Antony enters, the remainder of the <hi rend="italic">Act</hi> is from
Dryden&mdash;Dryden's Scene is a very good one, but it is not introduced in this place
with propriety&mdash;in Dryden's play, Ventidius in the <hi rend="italic">First Act</hi> estranges Antony from
Cleopatra, after which, naturally follows the Scene in which Antony reproaches her&mdash;
but the Editor of the present play reverses the order of things, and makes Dryden's
<pb n="588"/>
Second Scene precede his First&mdash;in Dryden's play the Scene lies the whole time at
Alexandria, but in this alteration Antony is represented as coming back to Egypt
merely to tell Cleopatra that they must part&mdash;which is not only contrary to the fact,
but absurd in itself&mdash;there was nothing like a quarrel between Antony and Cleopatra
until after the battle of Actium. <hi rend="italic">Third Act</hi> begins with the Sixth Scene of Shakespeare's 
<hi rend="italic">Third Act</hi>&mdash;then follows the Seventh Scene&mdash;the battle of Actium takes
place in the sight of the audience&mdash;and the Act is concluded from Shakespeare with
slight alterations. <hi rend="italic">Fourth Act</hi> is nearly the whole of it from Dryden&mdash;the celebrated
Scene between Antony and Ventidius is introduced with propriety&mdash;that in which
Ventidius leads on Octavia, might have been spared&mdash;and the one from Dryden,
which is improperly inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Second Act,</hi> might have been substituted for it&mdash;
Octavia's coming to Antony in Egypt is a poetical fiction on the part of Dryden, and
the Scene itself is not equal in merit to the Scenes of Shakespeare, which are left out
to make room for it&mdash;Dryden's description of Cleopatra on the Cydnus is omitted.
<hi rend="italic">Fifth Act</hi> is made up from Shakespeare and Dryden&mdash;Ventidius kills himself as in
Dryden&mdash;when Antony has fallen on his sword, the play is concluded from Shakespeare&mdash;C&aelig;sar 
and his party enter&mdash;after which, the Scene changes to the interior of
the monument&mdash;Antony, Cleopatra, etc. are discovered&mdash;Antony dies&mdash;and the Act
proceeds as in Shakespeare, but with great omissions&mdash;Cleopatra's speeches are sadly
mutilated&mdash;the play concludes with two short Scenes, partly from Shakespeare&mdash;and
a grand funeral procession.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This alteration is attributed to Kemble&mdash;but his name does not appear in the 
title-page&mdash;Capell's alteration is the better of the two&mdash;the modern editor omits too much
of Shakespeare&mdash;yet it must be allowed, that no person has altered one of Shakespeare's 
plays <hi rend="italic">materially,</hi> and has yet succeeded so well&mdash;the reason is obvious&mdash;he
has selected the best parts of Dryden's best Tragedy, instead of patching up a play,
with stuff of his own invention, as Davenant, Tate, Cibber, etc., have done.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This revival of Antony and Cleopatra did not meet with the success it deserved&mdash;
it ought not however to have been brought forward without a first rate actress in
Cleopatra&mdash;Mrs Siddons would have made a glorious part of Cleopatra (supposing
the part not to have been mutilated) and perhaps have fixed the play in the favour
of the public&mdash;she had been more than once or twice solicited by Kemble to act
Shakespeare's Cleopatra, but she continually declined for a very foolish reason&mdash;she
said she should hate herself, if she should play the part as it ought to be played.&rsquo;</p></quote></p>
<p>Genest mentions &lsquo;a grand funeral procession&rsquo; with which the play ended, but he
does not refer to an &lsquo;Epicedium&rsquo; which was sung at the same time. It begins with
a <hi rend="italic">Chorus</hi> which will, I think, amply serve as a specimen:

<quote><l>Cold in death the Hero lies;</l>
<l>Nerveless, now, the Victor's arm;</l>
<l>Quench'd the light'ning of his eyes,</l>
<l>The Foe to daunt, the Fair to charm.</l>
<l>Mourn, soldiers, mourn! your day is done;</l>
<l>Valour has lost its cheering sun;</l>
<l>The Roman Glory sets on Egypt's shore,</l>
<l>And great Mark Antony will rise no more.&mdash;etc.</l></quote>

<div2 n="Kembles Version" type="subsection"><head>KEMBLE'S VERSION</head>
<p>In the <title>Textual Notes</title> on the preceding pages of this present volume there occurs,
not infrequently, the name &lsquo;Kemble.&rsquo; Let it not be supposed that reference is
<pb n="589"/>
hereby made to this <hi rend="italic">Version</hi> of 1813, just described by Genest. It refers to a <hi rend="italic">MS
Stage-copy</hi> of this play, with Stage-directions in the handwriting of <name type="authority">J. P. Kemble</name>.
This copy has been kindly lent to me by my highly valued friend, <name type="authority">H. C. Folger</name>, jr.,
of Brooklyn, New York, who bought it at the sale of the library of Lawrence Doyle,
of Dublin, at Sotheby's, December, 1898, in whose catalogue it was described as
&lsquo;<quote>J. P. Kemble's copy with MS notes, stage-directions, etc., in his autograph. Note
on fly-leaf, &ldquo;G. Lamb, bought at Kemble's sale, 1821.&rdquo; </quote>&rsquo; The notes, stage-directions, 
etc., are unquestionably in Kemble's autograph, which is familiar to me.</p>
<p>The principle which seems to have rigidly guided Kemble in constructing this
<hi rend="italic">Version</hi> is omission; there are not many transpositions, and no additions of moment.
How extensive is this omission may be seen at once from the <title>Dramatis Person&aelig;,</title>
from whom, as given in Steevens's edition of 1793 (the edition which Kemble would
have probably used), Kemble has omitted Pompey, Ventidius, Scarus, Dercetas,
Demetrius, Philo, Dolabella, Proculeius, Menas, Menecrates, Taurus, Canidius,
Euphronius, Mardian, and Diomedes; in all fifteen characters; in reality fourteen.
Kemble has a new character, Titius by name, a friend of Antony, and highly accommodating 
in filling odd gaps. Hereby the thirty-four characters in Steevens's edition
are reduced to twenty in Kemble's <hi rend="italic">Version.</hi> It is evident, at once, that, by this reduction 
in the characters, the play is shortened by many hundred lines. In the following
description no reference is made to the Scenes where those characters appear that
Kemble has omitted; in speaking of Scenes &lsquo;in the original,&rsquo; the Scenes in the <title>Globe
Edition</title> are referred to.</p>
<p>The directions for the setting of the stage at the opening of the Play are as follows: 
&lsquo;<quote>The Palace in Alexandria should be of the most magnificent orders of the
purest Grecian architecture; yet the decorations and furniture of every apartment
should remind one that the scene lies in Egypt. <hi rend="italic">Portico of the Palace:</hi> Stage open
as far back as possible. View of the sea, ships, etc., The Pharos, Pompey's Pillar,
Cleopatra's Obelisk, Statues of Hercules, Alexander, Anubis.&rsquo; At the foot of the
page, Kemble, in the spirit of a true scholar, notes his authorities: &lsquo;Norden's Antiquities 
of Egypt. Montfaucon. Mr Knight's Antiques.</quote>&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">First Scene</hi> opens with a conversation between Thyreus and Enobarbus; after
the first ten lines, which in the original are spoken by Philo, but here by Enobarbus,
the latter gives the description of Cleopatra and her barge on the Cydnus. When
Antony and Cleopatra enter, the <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> continues to the end unchanged as in the
original. The first eighty lines of the <hi rend="italic">Second Scene</hi> are omitted, and then Shakespeare's 
<hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> continues with some minor omissions to the end. The <hi rend="italic">Third Scene</hi>
remains unchanged, as do also the <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fifth,</hi> with trifling omissions, and the
<hi rend="italic">First Act</hi> ends. The <hi rend="italic">Second Scene</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Second Act</hi> follows the original, with the
exception of twenty or thirty lines omitted here and there together with the description
of Cleopatra on the Cydnus which has been transferred to the <hi rend="italic">First Scene</hi> in the play.
The <hi rend="italic">Third Scene</hi> of the original is omitted, and instead the <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi> is retained, and
to it is added an abridgement of the first twenty lines of <hi rend="italic">Act III, Scene ii</hi>. The
<hi rend="italic">Fifth Scene</hi> of the original (Kemble's <hi rend="italic">Third Scene</hi>) is retained with trifling omissions.
The Messenger, Kemble calls Seleucus. Kemble's <hi rend="italic">Fourth Scene</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Act II.</hi> is composed 
of the <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fifth Scenes</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Act III.</hi> of the original, and after Octavia
leaves (III, iv, 31) the Soothsayer enters, exclaiming, &lsquo;<quote>Antony! Antony! Antony!
You, that wish yourself in Egypt.</quote>&rsquo; Antony demands, &lsquo;<quote>What would you?</quote>&rsquo; and then
follows <hi rend="italic">Act II,</hi> iii, from line 10 to &lsquo;<quote>I'the east my pleasure lies,</quote>&rsquo; with the omission of
a line or two. Kemble's II, v. is III, iii. of the original. Kemble's II, vi. is III, vi.
<pb n="590"/>
of the original, but very slightly &lsquo;cut.&rsquo; With this <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> Kemble's <hi rend="italic">Act II.</hi> ends, his
<hi rend="italic">Act III.</hi> begins with III, vii. of the original. This ending and this beginning are the
same as in Capell's <hi rend="italic">Version,</hi> and much can be said in favour of the division at this
point. The few words Canidius speaks in this <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> are, in Kemble's, spoken by
Enobarbus. <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> ii. in Kemble is <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> viii. of the original, whereof <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> ix. Kemble 
omits, and begins his <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> iii. with <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> x. of the original. At its close Enobarbus 
(Canidius in the original) after line 27 adds the lines which he says <hi rend="italic">aside</hi> in
III, xiii. &lsquo;<quote>Mine honesty and I begin to square,</quote>&rsquo; etc. Kemble's <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> iv, with little
variation, is <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> xi. of the original. Kemble's <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> v. is the same as <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> xii.
except that Euphronius is Kemble's Eros; his <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> vi. is <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> xiii, to the end of
<hi rend="italic">Act III.</hi> in the original, but Kemble continues the <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> by keeping Enobarbus on
the stage, and, omitting <hi rend="italic">Act IV, Scene</hi> i. of the original, has &lsquo;Re-enter Antony and
Eros&rsquo;; Antony at once begins &lsquo;<quote>He will not fight with me Domitius,</quote>&rsquo; etc., and so
on to the end of the <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> as in the original, except that Cleopatra is omitted; it is
Eros, and not Cleopatra therefore who asks Enobarbus <hi rend="italic">aside,</hi> &lsquo;<quote>What does he mean?</quote>&rsquo;
This <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> concludes Kemble's <hi rend="italic">Act III.;</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Act IV.</hi> begins at IV, iv, 18, and,
omitting Cleopatra and Charmian, continues through <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> v. of the original. Kemble's 
<hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> ii. comprises the first ten lines of IV, vi. of the original. His <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> iii.
begins with IV, viii, 1, and, after inserting eight or ten lines from the preceding <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi>
(IV, vii, 4-17), continues the <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> as in the original. Kemble's <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> iv. is composite; 
it begins with the Sentinels on their post (&lsquo;Silius and Varius&rsquo; in Kemble)
as in IV, ix. Enobarbus enters; his address to the moon is followed by his reflections 
in IV, vi, 16 &lsquo;<quote>Alexas did revolt,</quote>&rsquo; etc., through the rest of that <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> where his
treasure is returned to him by Antony (IV, vi, 20-39). <hi rend="italic">Act IV, Scene</hi> ix. is then
resumed and the last five lines of his dying speech closes the <hi rend="italic">Scene.</hi> Kemble's
<hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> v. begins with <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> x, and, omitting <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> xi. Cleopatra's entrance and the
lines addressed to her, as well as sundry others, ends with &lsquo;<quote>she dies for't. Eros ho!</quote>&rsquo;
IV, xii, 57. Kemble's <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> vi. is the same as <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> xiii; his <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> vii. is the same
as <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> xiv, with few omissions, the longest is from line 104-113. Kemble's <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi>
viii. is as follows: &lsquo;<quote><stage>Alexandria. A Street. Mournful Music. Titius and Guards pass
towards the Monument, bearing Antony on his Litter.</stage></quote>&rsquo; Kemble's <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> ix. follows
very closely <hi rend="italic">Scene</hi> xv, and with <hi rend="italic">Act IV.</hi> ends. Kemble's <hi rend="italic">Fifth Act</hi> adheres closely
throughout to the original. The longest omissions are the episode of Seleucus and
the Clown with the asps; and the most notable transpositions are the lines (62-72)
&lsquo;<quote>I'll not wait pinion'd at great C&aelig;sar's court</quote>&rsquo; down to &lsquo;<quote>And hang me up in chains</quote>&rsquo;
&mdash;which are transposed to follow Cleopatra's directions to Charmian about the asps,
line 228. In Kemble, Cleopatra says &lsquo;

<quote>Come hither Charmian [<hi rend="italic">Whispers Charmian.</hi>]
<hi rend="italic">Char.</hi> The aspics, Madam! <hi rend="italic">Cleop.</hi> I've spoke already and it is provided.</quote>

&rsquo; Lines
208-226 are omitted.</p>
<p>This <hi rend="italic">Version</hi> was made by a man of rare intelligence, an excellent judge of stage-effect, 
a scholar, and reverential admirer of Shakespeare. If the play must be
abbreviated to meet the requirements of the modern stage, it is not easy to see how
it can be done more judiciously. I have deemed it befitting to give a description of
it, thus minute, because, as far as I know, it exists only in manuscript.

<div2 type="subsection" n="Beerbohm Tree"><head>Beerbohm Tree</head>
<p>While these pages are going through the press, word comes from London of a
Revival there, unprecedented for splendour and sumptuousness, by Mr <name type="authority">Beerbohm
Tree</name>. The performance is thus spoken of by the <bibl>London <name>Times</name>, January 4, 1907</bibl>:
<quote><p>&lsquo;[<title>Antony and Cleopatra</title>] is one of the classics of what M. Porto-Riche would
call the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de l'Amour. Mr Bernard Shaw would give its theme a less elegant
name, &ldquo;sexual infatuation.&rdquo; Cleopatra is the irresistible enchantress, Antony the
colossal lover, and the whole play must burn to a white heat with their fire. . . .
Nevertheless, if you present <title>Antony and Cleopatra</title> at all, you must present it, above
everything, as a treatment of &ldquo;sexual infatuation&rdquo; in the grand style. And that is
just what Mr Tree has perceived and has done. . . . [Mr Tree] has the supreme
quality of thinking out the master-idea of a play, of disengaging its essential essence,
and of comprehending the play &ldquo;in its quiddity.&rdquo; To get at the heart of the play,
and to exhibit that heart to you, he will boldly lop here and still more boldly add
there&mdash;and who shall blame him? The pedants, no doubt; but certainly not the
great body of playgoers who come to Shakespeare, as they come to any other dramatist, 
simply and solely to get what pleasure they can out of him,&mdash;and whose pleasure
is dependent upon the clearness, the unity, of what is put before them. . . . Where is
that unity in <title>Antony and Cleopatra?</title> Is it in the Imperial Roman <hi rend="italic">motif?</hi> No;
that is merely North's <title>Plutarch</title> cut up into blank verse, and taken by itself would
be as dull as ditch water. Is it in the Octavia <hi rend="italic">motif,</hi> the contrast of the ultra-respectable 
matron, the pattern of domesticity, with the voluptuous orchidaceous Cleopatra?
No; that is a mere additional touch of art. It is in the passion-<hi rend="italic">motif</hi> of Cleopatra
and Antony, there and not elsewhere; and it is upon that <hi rend="italic">motif</hi> that Mr Tree concentrates 
the whole force of his stage. Hence the scenes in &ldquo;C&aelig;sar's House&rdquo; are
cut very short indeed. Hence the &ldquo;camp&rdquo; scenes become mere kinematographs.
Hence the passionate duologue between Antony and Cleopatra is given all the advantage 
of scenic magnificence and orchestral illustration. Egypt, not Rome nor Athens
nor Misenum, becomes the &ldquo;hub&rdquo; of the play. . . . A dissolving vision of the Sphinx
opens and closes the play. Weird nerve-thrilling Oriental strains are in the air.
You hear those same strains even in Rome or Athens&mdash;on the Wagnerian plan&mdash;
whenever Antony's thoughts turn to the far-away Cleopatra. For example, Antony
has just parted, not without conjugal tenderness, from Octavia. He seems, for once,
to have in him the makings of a model home-loving husband. But there swiftly
enters a messenger&mdash;Cleopatra's trusty messenger&mdash;with a scroll. Antony falls on
his couch, murmuring &ldquo;Cleopatra,&rdquo; and covering his eyes that he may shut out the
present scene and dream of her, again to the faint sound of the Oriental music. You
will search in vain for any indication of this &ldquo;business&rdquo; in Shakespeare; but it is
ingeniously, and quite legitimately, invented; it helps the unity of impression.
Another example: in the text C&aelig;sar describes Antony's return to Alexandria, how
&ldquo;I' th' market place on a Tribunal silver'd&rdquo; [etc. III, vi, 4-9; 17-19]. All this
Mr Tree actually shows you in a silent and yet extraordinarily eloquent tableau, which
will, perhaps, vex text-worshippers, but certainly will delight everybody else. . . .
One hardly knows which to admire most, the gorgeous interior of the palace in
which Cleopatra loves and languishes, or the mysterious cavern-like vastness of the
&ldquo;Monument,&rdquo; wherein she so nobly dies. Another masterpiece both of stage-carpentry 
and of stage management is the deck of Pompey's galley, where the Triumvirs 
and their officers get so imperially drunk. . . . It would be unjust not to mention
the name of the designer of the costumes, Mr Percy Macquoid. . . . Mr Tree himself 
makes a fine figure of Antony. He does not fall into the error of showing him
<pb n="592"/>
as a mere sensual weakling, &ldquo;passion's slave.&rdquo; Indeed his voluptuous thrills, even
when he is encircled by Cleopatra's arms, seem to lack something of responsive
warmth. No doubt Mr Tree will become more demonstratively amorous by and by.
Meanwhile you cannot help liking his Antony&mdash;which, of course, is quite the right
frame of mind. The Octavius of Mr Basil Gill and the Pompey of Mr Julian
L'Estrange are both excellent performances&mdash;they are proper &ldquo;Plutarch's men&rdquo; and
speak their lines roundly. Excellent, too, the Enobarbus of Mr Lyn Harding, good
to look at and a treat to hear. His &ldquo;purple patch&rdquo; describing Cleopatra's galley
could not be better delivered. The helpless intoxication of Lepidus on board Pompey's 
ship loses nothing of its grotesque repulsiveness in the hands of Mr Norman
Forbes; Mr Fisher White makes a quite remarkable thing of the Soothsayer; and
the unhappy messenger who is so bullied and terrified by the jealous Cleopatra is
very cleverly played by Mr Charles Quartermaine.</p>
<p>But Cleopatra herself? Everything in this play depends upon her. It is a terribly 
exacting part for any actress. She must have beauty, of course, and, what is
even more important, she must have glamour. She must be able to run at a rapid
sweep through the whole gamut of emotion&mdash;from dove-like cooings to the rage of a
tigress, from voluptuous languor to passion all aflame, from the frenzy of a virago to
the calm and statuesque majesty of one of the noblest death-scenes in all Shakespeare. 
It is a great ordeal for Miss Constance Collier. One trembled for her
beforehand, but quite needlessly as it turns out, for she not only looks but plays the
part splendidly. An occasional touch of our modern &ldquo;fine spoken&rdquo; accent, which
jars against the music of Shakespearian verse is the only blemish in what is on the
whole, as Enobarbus says of the Queen, &ldquo;a wonderful piece of work.&rdquo; &rsquo;</p></quote>
</p>
<p><cit><bibl><name>The Daily Telegraph</name> (28 December, 1906)</bibl><quote><p> Never, probably, in his career
has Mr Tree given us a more perfect stage adornment than that which he displays in
<title>Antony &amp; Cleopatra.</title> The gradation of colours, the delicate shades of violet, and
puce, and purple, the glittering robes of the Queen, the pomp and ceremony of her
court,&mdash;all these things, controlled by the practised artistry of Mr Percy Macquoid,
add to the pleasure of the eye, and give bodily semblance to the inner meaning of
the play. If for nothing else, the production would be extraordinary because of its
stage pictures. The first glimpse of the landing-stage of Cleopatra's palace, with
the barge that draws up to the steps, from which issue the regal pair of lovers; the
beautiful gold-bedizened scene, when Cleopatra wreaks her vengeance on the
messenger telling of Antony's betrothal; the magnificent tableau of the return of
Antony to Alexandria; above all, perhaps, the scene on Pompey's galley, where, in
the mysterious dark, lit by the fantastically-coloured lamps at the poop, the triumvirs
watch the dancing-girls, and themselves join in a mad debauch&mdash;these and other
pictures prove once more that whatever else we may have succeeded or failed in
doing on the modern stage, we have advanced the ordinary scenic artifices to a pitch
of success which was not dreamed of by our forefathers. In this, above all, lies the
triumph of last night's play, on which Mr Tree is warmly to be congratulated. . . .</p>
<p>Certainly the piece is very well played. Miss Constance Collier, handsome,
dark-skinned, barbaric, dominates the scene wherever she appears. Nor has she
ever had a better chance, or more fully availed herself of it, than when in the second
act she has to prove how close the tiger's cruelty lies under the sleek skin of the
cultivated woman. Mr Tree's Mark Antony was a fine, masculine, resolute rendering
of a hero ruined by love. There is not much subtlety or complexity in the part.
<pb n="593"/>
Antony is the Samson caught by Delilah; a sort of primitive, elemental hero, whose
degradation is all the more sure because his intellect is so inferior to his heart. And
this is precisely the hero whom Mr Tree so skilfully rendered. Apart from these two
principal personages, there were many others who gained a significant success on the
boards. Mr Basil Gill was very alert and vivid in the part of Octavius C&aelig;sar, saying
his lines with that prompt energy which belongs to the nature of the Shakespearian
conqueror. Mr Norman Forbes gave adequate presentment of the weakness of
Lepidus, an invaluable help in the evolution of the play, keeping the figure within
its proper limits, as wholly subordinate, yet illustrative of the increasing degeneracy
of the Roman. Mr Lyn Harding's Enobarbus was also a fine performance, picturesque, 
and varied, done with admirable lightness and no little artistic skill; while
Mr Julian L'Estrange, in such brief opportunities as he possessed, gave a firm sketch
of Sextus Pompeius. Cleopatra's two attendants, Iras and Charmian, were both
excellent&mdash;especially, perhaps, Charmian, as played by Miss Alice Crawford, who
revealed real dramatic power in the last act, and throughout presented a beautiful
picture of Eastern womanhood. Nor ought we to forget the dignified Sooth-sayer of
Mr J. Fisher White&mdash;a characteristic personage, who at various crises in the story
illustrated before our eyes the noiseless steps of on-coming Destiny.</p>
<p>It would be interesting, also, if it were possible, to recount all those clever
adaptations and contrivances by means of which so diffuse a play was brought within
manageable compass on the stage. We must limit ourselves, however, to one
example, where Shakespeare has given a real difficulty to the stage manager. Antony
who has tried, very imperfectly, to commit suicide, is lying outside the walls of Alexandria. 
Cleopatra and her maids have taken refuge in the monument. The problem
is how to get the wounded man into the monument, in order that the final scene of
death may be enacted before us. Mr Tree solves it as follows. In the gloom of
on-coming night the fallen hero, Mark Antony, is carried to the bottom of the walls,
and above, at a window, Cleopatra is looking out, to answer the cry of her defeated
lover. As the lights go out we see the body being hoisted upwards to the window;
then, by a quick change, we are transported to the interior of the monument, and
once more see Antony being lifted inwards through the open window, and brought
to the couch to receive Cleopatra's farewell. It was a clever bit of stage work,
which gave a complete and satisfactory impression without any lack of verisimilitude.</p></quote></cit></p>
<p><cit><bibl><name>The Athen&aelig;um</name> (5 January, 1907)</bibl><quote><p> For the first time, so far as records extend,
<title>Antony and Cleopatra</title> has been set upon the stage in a manner worthy of the place
it occupies in the Shakespearian drama, and its reception,&mdash;not that accorded it by
the first night's public at His Majesty's, but the lasting empire it exercises over the
play-going world,&mdash;should settle definitely its claims to rank among the great acting
plays. . . . As re-arranged by Andrew Halliday, the piece was produced at Drury
Lane in 1873. At the Standard it was also given; and in Manchester there was a
noteworthy revival. The experiment of Mrs Langtry; that of Madame Bernhardt,
which, however, was in Sardou, not Shakespeare; and that, sadly misjudged, of
Signora Duse, belong to days comparatively modern. Irving, urged to present the
play at the Lyceum, was discouraged by its record of indifferent success. Among
these efforts, that of Mr Tree is the most serious,&mdash;it might almost be said the sole
serious attempt. That in 1873 at Drury Lane came nearest to it in splendour and
had a certain amount of imaginative grace. . . . In the case of <title>Antony and Cleopatra</title>
it is impossible to regard with favour the restrictions upon scenic display which some
<pb n="594"/>
sticklers for the text, and nothing but the text, would have us observe. Here, if anywhere, 
is to be shown the full splendour of a court in which Egypt strove, if not with
Assyria, with Rome in wealth and luxury, when Cleopatra wore, as now she wears
the garb of Isis and accepted her worship, and her regal lover took on him the state
and splendour of his ancestor, Hercules. Nowise burdensome is the environment
Mr Tree provides. It is on the contrary splendidly helpful and serviceable, as well
as pleasurable to the spectator. As regards the mounting, it is not only the best that
has been given to this play&mdash;it may be regarded as the best that has been bestowed
upon any work of the author. . . . A splendid effect is realized in the scene at the
portals of Cleopatra's Palace where the royal lovers arrive at the river front and
disembark. Still more superb is that in which, apparelled like Isis, the queen greets
her returning warrior. As an example of scenic decoration and pageantry this is
unequalled. More sedate in beauty, but still unsurpassable, is that in the Palace in
which Cleopatra receives the unfortunate messenger who brings her intelligence of
the marriage of Antony and Octavia. Very fine, too, is the picture of debauch on
the galley of Pompey. A word of special praise is deserved by the costumes of the
Roman warriors, which are perfect. Those of Cleopatra and her hand-maidens
&lsquo;beggared all description.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The general interpretation is admirable. Looking Antony to the life, Mr Tree
shows something more than the inspired sensualist who for Cleopatra's sake counted
the world well lost. With him are well contrasted the forceful, passionate, resolute
C&aelig;sar of Mr Basil Gill, and the weak, bibulous Lepidus of Mr Norman Forbes.
Enobarbus, Sextus Pompeius, Eros, the Soothsayer, and other prominent characters
find effective exponents. Miss Constance Collier is a splendid Cleopatra, and shows
well the forcible passions that underlie the sensual charm and allurement of the
queen. The most dramatic scene in the play&mdash;her onslaught on the messenger
bringing her the unwelcome news of Antony's marriage&mdash;is thrilling in savage, passionate 
intensity and energy, and was greeted with rapture by the audience. Iras
and Charmian have delightful exponents, the latter, in the person of Miss Alice
Crawford, displaying dramatic power as well as charm. For the first time the play
has been adequately set before the public, by which it was received with ecstasy.
Whether the magnificence of the production will break the spell under which <title>Antony
and Cleopatra</title> supposedly labours remains to be seen. It can hardly, however, be
otherwise, since as spectacle and as intellectual entertainment the whole is equally
noteworthy.</p></quote></cit>

be taken to be somewhat mixed. That the Roman fashions were for the most part
accepted wherever the power of Rome had made itself a reality may be safely assumed,
but then these fashions were themselves moulded on those of other nations. . . . But
fashion, in old as in modern times, belongs to the upper classes, so that while I have
little hesitation in clothing Kleopatra and her court in the habit, or some slight modification 
of the habit, prevalent among Greeks&mdash;more or less adopted also by the
Roman aristocracy&mdash;the poor people, the Clown especially, and perhaps the Soothsayer, 
might very well exhibit in their dress some tradition of the old nation to which
they belonged.

of the Mediterranean with but little variation beyond that resulting from increase or
decrease in length or breadth of material. No doubt, too, the fashionable ladies of
Alexandria had their parasols, or umbracula, just the same as the ladies of Athens,
Rome, or Pompeii. Broad-brimmed straw hats, with low, saucer-shaped crowns, were
also probably worn. Octavia, <emph>after</emph> her marriage, might appear in the stola and the
square-cut white pallium, fastened with a fibula, or brooch, on the right shoulder,
leaving the right arm free.</p></quote></cit>

<p>In reference to the Stage Setting, <cit><bibl><name type="authority">Godwin</name> has the following (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> 26th
June, 1875)</bibl><quote><p> In the tragedy before us we have no less than thirty-six scenes. Of
these, twenty-five are architectural, including the one on board Pompey's galley,
which belongs to naval architecture. The other twenty-four are divided between
Alexandria, Rome, Messina, and Athens, or the respective residences of <name>Kleopatra</name>,
<name>C&aelig;sar</name>, <name>Pompeius,</name> and <name>Antonius,</name> but by far the most important of these are those
which belong to the City of the <name>Ptolemies.</name> It is next to impossible to reduce this
play to set scenes, for the unities of time and place are quite disregarded by the
author. In the first and last Acts a very slight change would enable us to bring
these into two scenes, if the fourth Scene of the first Act were carried on to the second
Act and the first Scene of the fifth Act omitted, but the second Act carries us in seven
Scenes from <name>Pompey's</name> house at Messina to the house of <name>Lepidus</name> at Rome, thence into
<name>C&aelig;sar's</name> palace, thence into the streets of Rome, thence to the palace at Alexandria,
thence to Misenum, and finally leaves us floating on the sea. In the third Act
(eleven Scenes) we are in Alexandria, Rome, and Athens; now on the plains of Syria,
and now on the promontory of Actium. In the fourth Act of thirteen Scenes we are
certainly confined to Alexandria and its neighbourhood, but we are perpetually moved
about from the inside of the palace to the outside, from within to without the walls,
from one camp to the other, until we are brought to rest in that remarkable Scene&mdash;
&lsquo;the Monument.&rsquo; I see no reason why the Scene in the house of <name>Lepidus</name> (Act ii.,
Scene 2) should not be laid in a lesche or under a colonnade before <name>C&aelig;sar's</name> house,
and thus serve also for the two Scenes which follow it. Indeed, by the exercise of
some little thought and care, the whole number of the architectural Scenes may be
fairly reduced, and it is possible without serious mutilation to prevent some of the
abrupt changes, as for example that brought about by the introduction of Alexandria
in the fifth Scene of the second Act; for there does not exist, as it seems to me, any
great obstacle to this Scene forming part of the third in the third Act. I cannot at
present see that we can do with less architectural scenery than that set down in the
following list, unless the Scenes at Athens and Messina are omitted altogether:

<list type="ordered">
<item> 1. The palace at Alexandria&mdash;interior.</item>
<item> 2. A Monument at Alexandria.</item>
<item> 3. <name>C&aelig;sar's</name> house at Rome&mdash;a lesche or colonnade.</item>
<item> 4. <name>Antony's</name> house at Athens&mdash;interior.</item>
<item> 5. <name>Pompey's</name> house at Messina&mdash;interior.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Of the interior of <name>Kleopatra's</name> palace the play presents us with no less than twelve
Scenes, and with one laid outside or before the palace (Act IV, Sc. iii), but all thirteen 
could reasonably pass in one hall if attention were given to the planning of it.
The remains of the temples at Phil&aelig;, Dendera, and Kalabsche, the relic of the palace
at Medinet Habou, and the representations of domestic architecture in the fragments
of wall paintings in our museums, are the only authorities available for this important
<pb n="597"/>
Scene. The temples and palace, however, that I have just mentioned must be held
to be far inferior to the temples and palaces of the royal city. . . .</p>
<p>The evidence of material wealth&mdash;a splendour lavish as daylight&mdash;would be there
[Alexandria]. Whatever marble and basalt, porphyry and serpentine, bronze or
silver, or gold or any other precious material could do, we may be quite sure was not
lacking. Mechanics would shine like the sun, in construction; multitudes of pillars,
and miles of avenue, and corridor, and labyrinth would speak of the mighty mass of
labour in the service of Egypt. . . .</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Monument&rsquo; of the play is evidently nothing more than the raised stage at
the back of the main stage, so common in the theatres of Shakespeare's time. An
Egyptian monument or tomb was constructed on principles which could not possibly
admit the poet's idea. But the Greek monument was altogether different. In the
one case we find a tomb, an architectural grave, a sepulchre; in the other we have a
house, a shrine, a temple. The little memorial of <name>Lysicrates</name> at Athens, and the
temple-like Lycian monument discovered at Xanthus, and now in our National
Museum, are extreme illustrations of one principle of design. In both the structure
consists of two storeys: the ground storey solid and comparatively plain, the upper
storey open and enriched with columns, figure sculpture, and other ornamental accessories. 
Now, although acting on a higher platform than the stage is always made to
look more or less ridiculous by modern scenic arrangements, in proof of which assertion 
I may cite <name>Juliet's</name> balcony as a flagrant example, and although I know of no
instance where this division of stage level has been well carried out, yet even in the
Veronese and Venetian plays there is no room for reasonable excuse if the Scene
results in failure; still less in the play under consideration should the acting suffer,
inasmuch as the area of the Monument of Egypt's <name>Queen</name> may be of almost any
size.</p>
<p><name>Antony's</name> house at Athens might be one of the old Greek houses or palaces, with
its double arrangement of Andronitis and Gyn&aelig;conitis, or the men's and women's
quarters. The fourth and fifth Scenes of the third Act introduce us to two rooms
in this house, but there is no reason why one interior should not suffice for both
Scenes, if the proper room be selected, which I take it should be the pillared hall
(<foreign lang="greek">a)ulh/</foreign>) of the Andronitis, which in a Greek house occupies the place of the Roman
Atrium. The floor might be of mosaic, whilst both the ceiling and walls might be
painted. <name>Pompey's</name> house at Messina might be either Roman or Greek, or half and
half. . . . In <title>Antony and Cleopatra</title> there is not one word about architecture or building, 
but then we have a description of the <name>Queen's</name> barge.</p></quote></cit>

<p>In this Edition the attempt is made to give, in the shape of <title>Textual Notes</title>,
on the same page with the Text, all the <title>Various Readings</title> of <title>The Tragedie of
Anthony and Cleopatra,</title> from the Second Folio down to the latest critical Edition of
the play; then, as <title>Commentary</title>, follow the Notes which the Editor has thought
worthy of insertion, not only for the purpose of elucidating the text, but at times as
illustrations of the History of Shakespearian criticism. In the <title>Appendix</title> will be
found criticisms and discussions which, on the score of length, could not be conveniently 
included in the <title>Commentary.</title>

</table></p>
<p>These last eight editions I have not collated beyond referring to them in disputed
passages.</p>
<p>Within the last twenty-five years,&mdash;indeed, since the appearance, in 1864, of
<title>The Globe Edition,</title>&mdash;the text of <name type="authority">Shakespeare</name> is become so settled that to collate,
word for word, the text of editions which have appeared within this term, would
be a needless task. When, however, an Editor revises his text in a Second or a
Third Edition, the case is different; it then becomes interesting to mark the effect
of maturer judgement.</p>
<p>The present <name type="authority">Text</name> is that of the <name type="authority">First Folio</name> of 1623. Every word, I might
say almost every letter, has been collated with the original; yet I am not so inexperienced 
as to believe that it is absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>In the <name type="authority">Textual Notes</name> the symbol Ff indicates the agreement of the <title>Second,
Third,</title> and <title>Fourth Folios.</title></p>
<p>I have not called attention to every little misprint in the Folio. The <title>Textual
Notes</title> will show, if need be, that they are misprints by the agreement of all the
Editors in their corrections.</p>
<p>Nor is notice taken of the first Editor who adopted the modern spelling, or substituted 
commas for a parenthesis, or changed? to !.</p>
<p>The sign + indicates the agreement of <name type="authority">Rowe</name>, <name type="authority">Pope</name>, 
<name type="authority">Theobald</name>, <name type="authority">Hanmer</name>,
<name type="authority">Warburton</name>, and <name type="authority">Johnson</name>.
<pb n="601"/></p>
<p>When <name type="authority">Warburton</name> precedes <name type="authority">Hanmer</name> in the <title>Textual Notes,</title> it indicates that
<name type="authority">Hanmer</name> has followed a suggestion of <name type="authority">Warburton's</name>.</p>
<p>The words <emph>et cet.</emph> after any reading indicate that it is the reading of <emph>all other</emph>
editions.</p>
<p>The words <emph>et seq.</emph> indicate the agreement of all subsequent editions.</p>
<p>The abbreviation (<emph>subs.</emph>) indicates that the reading is <emph>substantially</emph> given, and that
immaterial variations in spelling, punctuation, or stage-directions are disregarded.</p>
<p>When <emph>Varr.</emph> precedes <emph>Steev.</emph> or <emph>Mal.</emph> it includes the <title>Variorums</title> of 1773, 1778, and
1785; when it follows <emph>Steev.</emph> or <emph>Mal.</emph> it includes the <title>Variorums</title> of 1803, 1813, and
1821.</p>
<p>An Emendation or Correction given in the <title>Commentary</title> is not repeated in the
<title>Textual Notes,</title> unless it has been adopted by an Editor in his Text; nor is <emph>conj.</emph>
added in the <title>Textual Notes</title> to the name of him who has proposed the conjecture,
unless the conjecture happens to be that of an Editor, in which case omission of
<emph>conj.</emph> would lead to the inference that such was the reading of his text.</p>
<p><name type="authority">Coll.</name> MS refers to <name type="authority">Collier's</name> copy of the Second Folio bearing in its margin
manuscript annotations. When Collier adopted its readings in his Text, it is placed
in parenthesis (MS). <name type="authority">Coll.</name> '53 stands for a monovolume which <name type="authority">Collier</name> issued in
1853, wherein these MS readings are incorporated in the Text.

<p>To economise space in the foregoing pages, as a general rule merely the name
of an author has been given, followed, in parenthesis, by the number of volume
and page.</p>
<p>In the following List, arranged alphabetically, enough of the full titles is set
forth to serve the purposes of either identification or reference.</p>
<p>Be it understood that this List contains only those books wherefrom quotations
have been taken at first hand. It does not include those which have been consulted
or used in verifying references; were these included the list would be very many
times longer.</p></div2>
