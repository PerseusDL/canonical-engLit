              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">L. Schmitz</hi> (Smith, <hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi> s. v.):
              Augustus, the first Emperor of the Roman Empire, was born <hi rend="smallcap"
              >b.c.</hi> 63; his grandmother was Julia, Julius C&aelig;sar's sister; he was,
              therefore, C&aelig;sar's grandnephew. He was most carefully educated and became
              very early a great favourite of his granduncle who, being childless, is said to have
              made his will in favour of Octavius, as Augustus was then called. The name Augustus,
              by which he is best known, was conferred upon him later by the Senate. After the death
              of C&aelig;sar, Augustus joined Antonius in prosecuting a war against
              C&aelig;sar's murderers. In the course of it, the first Triumvirate was formed,
              consisting of Antonius, Augustus, and Lepidus, and in the proscriptions of the
              adherents of Brutus and Cassius which followed, Augustus was no less cruel than
              Antonius. After the battle of Philippi where Brutus and Cassius in despair committed
              suicide, and where the victory was mainly gained by Antonius, a new division of the
              world was made by the Triumvirs, and Augustus returned to Italy. Here Fulvia,
              Antonius' wife, fomented quarrels and insurrections in order to draw her husband away
              from Cleopatra. Augustus, however, succeeded in defeating these garboils and Fulvia's
              death at Sicyon accelerated a peace between him and Antonius, which was further
              cemented by the marriage of the latter to Octavia, the sister of Augustus. Peace
              seemed to be now restored everywhere, but Augustus was anxious to find some pretext
              whereby he could deprive Sextus Pompeius of his provinces which more or less
              controlled the supplies of food for Rome. This pretext was found in an accusation that
              Pompeius upheld piracy, and in a war which followed Augustus was victorious and
              Pompeius fled to Asia, and Lepidus who wanted Sicily from which Pompeius had just been
              driven was deprived of his army and sent to Rome where he ended his days as Pontifex
              Maximus. Having thus disposed of two of his rivals, Augustus felt himself strong
              enough to cope with the third, Antonius, whose arrogant proceedings in the East,
              coupled with his repudiation of Octavia, afforded ample grounds to Augustus for
              representing him as an enemy to Rome. War was now declared against Cleopatra, for
              Antonius was looked upon as merely her infatuated slave. After the battle of Actium in
              September, <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 31, and the deaths of Antonius and Cleopatra,
              Egypt was made a Roman province. [His subsequent career has no bearing on this play,
              and is, therefore, omitted.] </p>

                <hi rend="bold">Lepidus</hi>
              </lemma> M. &AElig;mil. Lepidus, the Triumvir, is first mentioned in the year <hi
                rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 52, when the Senate appointed him Interrex. In the civil
              war between C&aelig;sar and </p>
            <p>Pompey, Lepidus, who was then Pr&aelig;tor, joined C&aelig;sar. On the
              evening before the fatal 15th of March, C&aelig;sar had supped with Lepidus who
              was present on the following day in the Curia of Pompey, in the Campus Martius, and
              saw C&aelig;sar fall by the hands of the assassins; Lepidus stole hastily away,
              and repaired to his troops which he was then collecting for his province. In the
              turbulent times which followed, Lepidus endeavoured to remain neutral but was at last
              compelled again to espouse Antony's side and toward the end of the year the celebrated
              conference took place at Bononia between Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus, which resulted
              in the Triumvirate. In the proscription-lists which followed this conference, Lepidus
              placed the name of his own brother, Paullus, who, to be sure, had been one of the
              Senators who had proclaimed his brother &AElig;milius a public enemy for having
              joined Antonius; the soldiers, however, who were appointed to kill him allowed him to
              escape, possibly with the connivance of his brother. In <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi>
              36, Octavius summoned him to Sicily to assist in a war against Sextus Pompeius.
              Lepidus obeyed, but tired of being treated as a subordinate, he resolved to acquire
              Sicily for himself, and regain his lost power. But he did not possess the confidence
              of his army; and Octavius found means on his arrival to seduce it from its allegiance.
              Detachment after detachment deserted Lepidus, who was at last forced to surrender. All
              his courage forsook him. He put on mourning, and threw himself before the knees of
              Octavius, begging for life. This was granted to him; Octavius then deprived him of his
              Triumvirate, his army, and his provinces, but allowed him to retain his private
              fortune. Still, insults and the loss of honour and rank did not shorten his life; he
              survived till <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 13. Lepidus had no decided character and
              was as incapable of committing great crimes as of performing noble acts. He possessed
              great wealth and was little scrupulous as to the means of gaining it. Neither in war,
              nor in peace did he show any distinguished ability. His wife was Junia, a sister of
              the Brutus who killed C&aelig;sar. (Much condensed from an unsigned article in

              <hi rend="smallcap">E. H. Bunbury</hi> (Smith, <hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi> s.
              v.): Sextus Pompeius, the younger son of the Triumvir, was born <hi rend="smallcap"
                >b.c.</hi> 75, since he was forty at the time of his death in <hi rend="smallcap"
                >b.c.</hi> 35. He did not possess any great abilities. He took arms from necessity,
              as he was first deprived of everything by C&aelig;sar, and then proscribed by the
              Triumvirs. His success was owing more to circumstances than to his own merits; the war
              between the Triumvirs and the republicans, and subsequently the misunderstandings
              between Octavius and Antonius enabled him to obtain and keep possession of Sicily. He
              seems never to have aspired to supreme power. He was personally brave, but deficient
              in refinement, with hardly any knowledge of literature. Paterculus says that he could
              not speak correctly, but this is doubtless an exaggeration. In <hi rend="smallcap"
                >b.c.</hi> 38 he sustained a severe loss in the desertion of one of his principal
              legates, Menas, who surrendered to Octavius Sardinia and Corsica together with a large
              naval and military force. After varying fortune in his contests with Octavius,
              Pompeius was at last disastrously defeated by Agrippa, Octavius's legate, <hi
                rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 36. In the following year Antonius gathered a large force
              by land and sea which threatened to crush Pompeius; whereupon his friends, among them
              his father-in-law, and his soldiers deserted him; he was obliged to surrender and was
              put to death, <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 35. </p>

                <hi rend="bold">Domitius Enobarbus</hi>
              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Smith</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi> s. v.): Cn.
              Domitius Ahenobarbus [i. e. <hi rend="italic">Red-beard</hi>] had probably no share in
              the murder of C&aelig;sar; but followed Brutus into Macedonia after
              C&aelig;sar's death, and was condemned by the Lex Pedia in <hi rend="smallcap"
                >b.c.</hi> 43 as one of the murderers. A year or two later Ahenobarbus became
              reconciled to Antony which gave great offence to Octavius. When the open rupture took
              place between Antony and Octavius, Ahenobarbus fled from Rome to Antony, at Ephesus,
              where he found Cleopatra with him, and endeavoured, in vain, to obtain her removal
              from the army. Many of the soldiers, disgusted with the conduct of Antony, offered the
              command to him; but he preferred deserting the party altogether, and accordingly went
              over to Octavius shortly before the battle of Actium. He was not, however, present at
              the battle; he died a few days after joining Octavius. [<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Walker</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Vers.</hi> 186) remarks that this name &lsquo;is
              frequently used as if it were a trisyllable, in whatever way the anomaly is to be
              explained,&rsquo;&mdash;a remark which reveals Walker's strength and his
              weakness; his strength, in that it is a proof of his extraordinary observation, and
              his weakness, in that it makes no allowance for the position of a word in a line, or
              for the liberty permissible in dramatic colloquies. In all the five examples which
              Walker quotes, the name occurs either in a broken line or at the end of a
              line,&mdash;where there is always for proper names a certain freedom in rhythm,
              and where in this particular case, the name can be without harshness pronounced as a
              quadrisyllable; and that it was intended to be so pronounced we can almost positively
              conclude, because when Shakespeare wished it to be a trisyllable it was so spelled,
              namely: &lsquo;You see we haue burnt our cheekes. Strong Enobarbe&rsquo; II,
              vii, 144.&mdash;an instance which Walker seems to have overlooked. For those who
              may be interested in this question, I subjoin the places where the name
              occurs:&mdash;I, ii, 153; II, ii, 1; II, ii, 283; II, vii, 144; III, ii, 64; III,
              xiii, 1; IV, v, 10; IV, v, 23; IV, vi, 26; IV, vii, 32; IV, ix, 12 (<hi rend="italic"
                >bis</hi>). It may be possibly worthy of note as a proof of Shakespeare's exclusive
              dependence on North's translation, that in Latin the name is not Enobarbus, but <hi
                rend="italic">A&euml;nobarbus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ahenobarbus,</hi> which
              the Domitian clan bore in memory of the appearance, to their founder, of Castor and
              Pollux who bade him carry the news of a victory to Rome and confirmed his faith in
              their divinity by gently stroking his black beard which turned immediately to a red or

              <hi rend="smallcap">George Long</hi> (Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi> s.
              v.): &lsquo;P. Ventidius Bassus was a native of Picenum, and having fought against
              the Romans, he was made prisoner by Pompeius Strabo, and appeared in his triumphal
              procession in chains; after this, being manumitted, he was admitted into the Senate in
              the course of time, and was then made Praetor in the time of C&aelig;sar, and
              attained such honour as to conquer the Parthians and to enjoy a triumph for his
              victory.&rsquo;&mdash;Dion Cass. xliii, 51. We must infer that he was quite a
              youth when he was captured by the Romans. When he grew up to man's estate, he got a
              poor living by furnishing mules and vehicles for those magistrates who went from Rome
              to administer a province. In this humble employment he became known to Julius
              C&aelig;sar, whom he accompanied into Gaul. After C&aelig;sar's death,
              Ventidius sided with Antonius in the war of Mutina, <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 43.
              In </p>
            <p><date>b.c. 39</date>, Antonius sent Ventidius into Asia to oppose the Parthians under
              Labienus, whom Ventidius defeated and in the following year attacked Pacorus, king of
              the Parthians, whom also he defeated. Pacorus fell in battle and his head was sent
              round to the Syrian cities, thereby inducing them to keep quiet. In the meantime
              Antonius arrived, and so far from being pleased with the success of Ventidius, he
              showed great jealousy of him, and treated him in an unworthy manner. It is said that
              Antiochus had offered Ventidius a thousand talents as the price of peace, and that
              Antonius, who undertook the siege of Samosata, was obliged to be content with three
              hundred. The Senate decreed to Antonius a triumph for the victories of Ventidius; and
              Antonius rewarded his general by dismissing him from his employment. Yet the services
              of Ventidius were too great to be overlooked, and on coming to Rome, he had a triumph,

              <hi rend="smallcap">L. Schmitz</hi> (Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict.</hi>): L.
              Canidius Crassus was with Lepidus in Gaul, in <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 43, when
              Antonius was compelled to seek refuge there and was the main instrument in bringing
              about the union between Lepidus and Antony. In <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 32, when
              Antonius resolved upon the war with Octavius, Canidius was commissioned to lead the
              army stationed in Armenia to the coast. On the outbreak of the war, many of Antonius's
              friends advised him to remove Cleopatra from the army, but Canidius who was bribed by
              the queen, opposed this plan, and she accordingly accompanied her lover to the fatal
              war. Shortly afterward, however, Canidius also advised Antonius to send her back to
              Egypt, and to fight the decisive battle on land and not on sea. This time his advice
              was disregarded. During the battle of Actium, Canidius who had command of Antonius's
              land forces, could act the part only of a spectator. After the unfortunate issue of
              the sea-fight, Canidius and his army still held out for seven days in the hope that
              Antonius would return; but in the end Canidius in despair took to flight, and followed
              his master to Alexandria, where he informed him of the issue of the contest and of the
              fate of his army. After the fall of Antonius, Canidius was put to death by the command
              of Octavius. He died as a coward, although in times of prosperity he had been in the
              habit of boasting that death had no terrors for him. </p>

              <hi rend="smallcap">Thomas Dyer</hi> (Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi>
              greatly condensed): It is most probable that M&aelig;cenas (it seems to be agreed
              that this spelling is right) was born between <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 73 and 63;
              his family was of high antiquity and traced its descent from an Etruscan source. All
              that we know of his life is to be gathered from scattered notices of him in poets and
              historians of Rome. Shortly after the appearance of Octavius on the political stage,
              we find the name of M&aelig;cenas in frequent association with his; and there can
              be no doubt that he was of great use to him in assisting him to consolidate and
              establish the empire. In the year <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 40, M&aelig;cenas
              took part in the negotiations with Antonius which led to the peace of Brundusium,
              confirmed by the marriage of Antonius with Octavia, the sister of Octavius. About two
              years afterward M&aelig;cenas seems to have been employed in negotiating with
              Antonius, and it was probably on this occasion that Horace accompanied him to
              Brundusium, a journey which he has described in the <hi rend="italic">Satire,</hi> i,
              5. In <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 36 we find M&aelig;cenas in Sicily with
              Octavius, then engaged in an expedition against Sextus Pompeius. From this time till
              the battle of Actium, <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 31, history is silent concerning
              him; but at that period we find him again intrusted with the administration of the
              civil affairs of Italy. It has indeed been maintained by many critics that
              M&aelig;cenas was present at the seafight of Actium; but the best modern scholars
              who have discussed the subject have shown that this could not have been the case and
              that he remained in Rome during this time. [His subsequent life, familiar to us all as
              the munificent patron of learning and of poets, has no connection with the present

              <hi rend="smallcap">William Plate</hi> (Smith, <hi rend="italic">Dict. s. v.</hi>): M.
              Vipsanius Agrippa was born <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 63, and was descended from a
              very obscure family. At the age of twenty he studied at Apollonia in Illyria, together
              with young Octavius, afterwards Augustus. After the murder of C&aelig;sar, Agrippa
              advised Octavius to proceed immediately to Rome. Octavius took Agrippa with him, and
              in <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 43 gave him the delicate commission of prosecuting
              Cassius, one of the murderers of C&aelig;sar At the outbreak of the Perusinian war
              between Octavius and L. Antonius, Agrippa commanded part of the forces of Octavius,
              and finally besieged L. Antonius in Perusia, and took the town. In <hi rend="smallcap"
                >b.c.</hi> 38, Agrippa obtained fresh success in Gaul and contributed much to
              securing the power of Octavius, who recalled him to command the war against Sex.
              Pompeius, and promoted him to the consulship. After this promotion, Agrippa was
              charged by Octavius with the construction of a fleet, inasmuch as Sex. Pompeius was
              master of the sea. This order Agrippa executed with prompt energy. The Lucrine lake
              was transformed into a safe harbour and there he exercised his sailors till they were
              able to encounter the experienced sailors of Pompey. In two naval battles he gained
              such victories that he broke the naval supremacy of Pompey. In <hi rend="smallcap"
                >b.c.</hi> 33, although he had been consul, he voluntarily accepted the
              &aelig;dileship, and expended immense sums of money on great public works. He
              restored the aqueducts, and constructed a new one, fifteen miles in length. His
              various splendid buildings were adorned with statues by the first artists in Rome,
              among these buildings was the </p>
            <p>Pantheon on which his name as the builder may still be read. When the war broke out
              between Octavius and Anthony, Agrippa was appointed commander-in-chief, and in the
              battle of Actium, where he commanded, the victory was mainly owing to his skill. [With
              this event our present interest in him ceases. He was one of the most distinguished

              Pompeius, seems to have been of a thoroughly mercenary character, and, in looking
              after the main chance, assumed and threw off allegiance with as much indifference

              latter the treacherous proposal given in II, vii, 70-98. When Pompeius refused to
              become an accomplice to the treachery, Shakespeare represents Menas as saying aside
              &lsquo;I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more,&rsquo; which was true only
              for a while. When not long after Pompey sent for Menas, the latter put all the
              messengers to death, and agreed to surrender the island of Sardinia with all its
              garrisons to Octavius, who treated him with great distinction and placed him in
              command of his ships. Just before a re-commencement of hostilities between Pompey and
              Octavius, Menas again played the deserter and went back to his old master. In the
              operations which followed, Menas gained some advantages; but in obedience to what he
              believed to be his interest, he again deserted to Octavius, who received him gladly,

              <hi rend="smallcap">W. Smith</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dict. s. v.</hi>): Cleopatra, the
              third child and eldest surviving daughter of Ptolemy Auletes, [the <hi rend="italic"
                >Fluteplayer,</hi>] was born towards the end of <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 69,
              and was consequently seventeen at the death of her father, who in his will appointed
              her heir of his kingdom in conjunction with her younger brother, Ptolemy, whom she was
              to marry. The personal charms, for which she was so famed, shewed themselves in early
              youth, as we are told by Appian that she made an impression on the heart of Antony in
              her fifteenth year, when he was at Alexandria with Gabinius. Her joint reign did not
              last long, as Ptolemy, or rather Pothinus and Achillas, his chief advisers, expelled
              her from the throne, about <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 49. In the following year
              C&aelig;sar arrived in Egypt in pursuit of Pompey, and took upon himself to
              arrange matters between Cleopatra and her brother. According to Plutarch, she made her
              entry </p>
            <p>into C&aelig;sar's apartment in a bale of cloth, which was brought by
              Apollodorus, her attendant, as a present to C&aelig;sar. However this may be, her
              plan fully succeeded, and we find her replaced on the throne, much to the indignation
              of her brother and the Egyptians, who involved C&aelig;sar in a war in which he
              ran great personal risk, but which ended in his favour. In the course of it, young
              Ptolemy was killed, probably drowned in the Nile, and Cleopatra obtained the undivided
              rule. She was, however, associated by C&aelig;sar with another brother of the same
              name, and still quite a child, with a view to conciliate the Egyptians, with whom she
              appears to have been very unpopular, and she was also nominally married to him. While
              C&aelig;sar was in Egypt, Cleopatra lived openly with him, and would have detained
              him there longer, but for the war with Pharnaces, which tore him from her arms. She
              however joined him in Rome, in company with her nominal husband, and there continued
              the same open intercourse with him, living in apartments in his house, much to the
              offense of the Romans. She was loaded with honours and presents by C&aelig;sar,
              and seems to have stayed at Rome till his death, <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 44. She
              had a son by him named C&aelig;sarion, who was afterwards put to death by
              Octavius. After the death of C&aelig;sar, she fled to Egypt, and in the troubles
              which ensued she took the side of the Triumvirate, and assisted Dolabella both by sea
              and land, resisting the threats of Cassius, who was preparing to attack her when he
              was called away by the entreaties of Brutus. She also sailed in person with a
              considerable fleet to assist Antony after the defeat of Dolabella, but was prevented
              from joining him by a storm and the bad state of her health. She had however done
              sufficient to prove her attachment to C&aelig;sar's memory (which seems to have
              been sincere), and also to furnish her with arguments to use to Antony, who in the end
              of the year 41 came into Asia Minor, and there summoned Cleopatra to attend, on the
              charge of having failed to co-operate with the Triumvirate against C&aelig;sar's
              murderers. She was now in her twenty-eighth year, and in the perfection of matured
              beauty, which in conjunction with her talents and eloquence, and perhaps the early
              impression which we have mentioned, completely won the heart of Antony. The first use
              Cleopatra made of her influence was to procure the death of her younger sister,
              Arsino&euml;, who had once set up a claim to the kingdom. Her brother, Ptolemy,
              she seems to have made away with before, by poison. Her connexion with Antony was
              interrupted for a short time by his marriage with Octavia, but was renewed on his
              return from Italy, and again on his return from his Parthian expedition, when she went
              to meet him in Syria with money and provisions for his army. According to Josephus,
              Cleopatra during Antony's expedition went into Jud&aelig;a, part of which Antony
              had assigned to her and Herod had necessarily ceded, and there attempted to win Herod
              by her charms, probably with a view to his ruin, but failed, and was in danger of
              being put to death by him. The report, however, of Octavia's having left Rome to join
              Antony, made Cleopatra tremble for her influence, and she therefore exerted all her
              powers of pleasing to endeavour to retain it. From this time Antony appears quite
              infatuated by his attachment, and willing to humour every caprice of Cleopatra. We
              find her assuming the title of Isis, and giving audience in that dress to ambassadors,
              that of Osiris being adopted by Antony, and their children called by the title of the
              Sun and the Moon, and declared heirs of unbounded territories. One can hardly wonder
              that Octavius should represent Antony to the Romans as &lsquo;bewitched by that
              accursed Egyptian&rsquo;; and he was not slow in availing himself of the disgust,
              which Antony's conduct occasioned, to make a determined effort to crush him. War,
              however, was declared against Cleopatra, and not against Antony, as a less invidious </p>
            <p>way. Cleopatra, indeed, persuaded Antony to retreat to Egypt, but the attack of
              Octavius frustrated this intention, and the famous battle took place (<hi
                rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 31), in the midst of which, when fortune was wavering
              between the two parties, Cleopatra gave a signal of retreat to her fleet, and herself
              led the way. Cleopatra died <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 30, in the thirty-ninth year
              of her age, and with her ended the dynasty of the Ptolemies in Egypt. She had three
              children by Antony: Alexander and Cleopatra, who were twins, and Ptolemy Philadelphus.

              Consul <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 50, and subsequently to the Triumvir, M.
              Antonius. She lost her husband towards the latter end of <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi>
              41; and as Fulvia, the wife of Antony, died about the same time, Octavius and Antony,
              who had lately been at variance, cemented their reconciliation by the marriage of
              Octavia to Antony. This marriage caused the greatest joy among all classes, and
              especially in the army, and was regarded as a harbinger of a lasting peace. Octavius
              was warmly attached to his sister, and she possessed all the charms, accomplishments
              and virtues likely to fascinate the affections and secure a lasting influence over the
              mind of a husband. Her beauty was universally allowed to be superior to that of
              Cleopatra, and her virtue was such as to excite even admiration in an age of growing
              licentiousness and corruption. Nor at first did this union disappoint public
              expectation. By the side of Octavia, Antony for a time forgot Cleopatra, and the
              misunderstandings and jealousies which had again arisen between her brother and
              husband, and which threatened an open rupture in the year 36, were removed by her
              influence and intervention. But Antony had by this time become tired of his wife; and
              longed to rejoin Cleopatra. The war with the Parthians summoned him to the East.
              Octavia accompanied him from Italy as far as Corcyra, but upon arriving at that island
              he sent her back to her brother, under the pretext of not exposing her to the perils
              and hardships of the war. On arriving in Asia, Antony soon forgot, in the society of
              Cleopatra, both his wife and the Parthians. Octavia, however, resolved to make an
              effort to regain her husband. In the following year, <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 35,
              she set out from Italy with reinforcements of men and money to assist Antony in his
              war against Artavasdes, king of Armenia; but Antony resolved not to meet her and sent
              her a message, when she had arrived as far as Athens, requesting her to return home.
              Octavia obeyed; she was great-minded enough to send him the money and troops, and he
              mean enough to accept them. On her return to Rome, Octavius ordered her to leave her
              husband's house and come and reside with him, but she refused to do so, and would not
              appear as one of the causes of the war; she remained in her husband's abode, where she
              educated Antony's younger son, by Fulvia, with her own children. But this noble
              conduct had no effect upon the hardened heart of Antony, who had become the complete
              slave of Cleopatra; and when the war broke out in <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 32, he
              sent his faithful wife a bill of divorce. After the death of Antony she still remained
              true to the interests of his children, notwithstanding the wrongs she had received
              from their father. For Julius, the younger son of Antony, by Fulvia, she obtained the
              special favour of Augustus, and she even brought up with maternal care his children by

              340 to p. 368 inclusive, in the division of &lsquo;Tragedies.&rsquo; Although
              at the beginning it has <hi rend="italic">Actus Primus, Sc&aelig;na Prima,</hi> it
              is not divided into acts and scenes, nor is the defect cured in any of the subsequent

              characters. &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>
            <p>1. <hi rend="smallcap">Coleridge</hi> (p. 315): Shakespeare can be complimented only
              by comparison with himself: all other eulogies are either heterogeneous, as when they
              are in reference to Spenser or Milton; or they are flat truisms, as when he is gravely
              preferred to Corneille, Racine, or even his own immediate successors, Beaumont and
              Fletcher, Massinger and the rest. The highest praise, or rather form of praise, of
              this play, which I can offer in my own mind, is the doubt which the perusal always
              occasions in me, whether the &lsquo;Antony and Cleopatra&rsquo; is not, in all
              exhibitions of a giant power in its strength and vigour of maturity, a formidable
              rival of &lsquo;Macbeth,&rsquo; &lsquo;Lear,&rsquo;
              &lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Othello.&rsquo; <hi rend="italic"
                >Feliciter audax</hi> is the motto for its style comparatively with that of
              Shakespeare's other works, even as it is the general motto of all his works compared
              with those of other poets. Be it remembered, too, that this happy valiancy of style is
              but the representative and result of all the material excellencies so expressed. This
              play should be perused in mental contrast with &lsquo;Romeo and
              Juliet;&rsquo;&mdash;as the love of passion and appetite opposed to the love
              of affection and instinct. But the art displayed in the character of Cleopatra is
              profound; in this, especially, that the sense of criminality in her passion is
              lessened by our insight into its depth and energy, at the very moment that we cannot
              but perceive that the passion itself springs out of the habitual craving of a
              licentious nature, and that it is supported and reinforced by voluntary stimulus and
              sought-for associations, instead of blossoming out of spontaneous emotion. Of all
              Shakespeare's historical plays, &lsquo;Antony and </p>
            <p>Cleopatra&rsquo; is by far the most wonderful. There is not one in which he has
              followed history so minutely, and yet there are few in which he impresses the notion
              of angelic strength so much;&mdash;perhaps none in which he impresses it more
              strongly. This is greatly owing to the manner in which the fiery force is sustained
              throughout, and to the numerous momentary flashes of nature counteracting the historic
              abstraction. As a wonderful specimen of the way in which Shakespeare lives up to the
              very end of this play, read the last part of the concluding scene. And if you would
              feel the judgement as well as the genius of Shakespeare in your heart's core, compare
              this astonishing drama with Dryden's &lsquo;All for Love.&rsquo; <hi
                rend="smallcap">A. W. Schlegel</hi> (iii, 173): <hi rend="italic">Antony and
                Cleopatra</hi> may be, in some measure, considered as a continuation of <hi
                rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar:</hi> the two principal characters, Antony and
              Augustus, are in both pieces equally sustained. <hi rend="italic">Antony and
              Cleopatra</hi> is a play of great compass, its progress is less simple than in <hi
                rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar.</hi> The fullness and variety of the political
              and warlike events, which ultimately brought about the union of the threefold division
              of the Roman empire under one master, were perhaps too vast to be combined for a
              distinct survey in one dramatic picture. This it is wherein precisely lies the great
              difficulty of the historical drama, it must be at the same time a condensed epitome of
              history and a vivid expansion of it; this difficulty Shakespeare has for the most part
              successfully overcome. Here, however, many things, which occur in the background, are
              intimated only in such a way as to presuppose an intimate knowledge of history, and
              the comprehension of a work of art should never depend on any extrinsic information.
              Many persons of historical importance appear and disappear in passing; the preparatory
              and co-operating circumstances are not adequately massed so as not to distract our
              view. The principal personages emerge, nevertheless, in outline and colour most
              forcibly, and arrest the imagination. In Antony we observe a combination of great
              qualities, weaknesses, and vices; powerful ambition and magnanimous emotions; we see
              his degradation in luxurious enjoyment and his noble shame at his own
              lapses,&mdash;inspirited to follow noble resolutions which are in turn shattered
              by the seductions of a woman. It is Hercules in the chains of Omphale, transferred
              from the fabulous heroic age to authentic history, and clad in the Roman toga. The
              seductive arts of Cleopatra are displayed without a veil; she is also an ambiguous
              creature composed of royal pride, feminine vanity, luxury, inconstancy, and genuine
              attachment. Although the reciprocal passion of herself and Antony is morally
              worthless, it still excites our sympathy as an insurmountable fascination; they seem
              formed for each other, inasmuch as Cleopatra stands quite as much alone for her
              seductive charm as Antony for his splendid deeds. As they die for each other, we
              forgive them for having lived for each other. The open-hearted and lavish character of
              Antony is excellently contrasted with the heartless littleness of Octavius
              C&aelig;sar, whom Shakespeare completely saw through, without allowing himself to
              be led astray by the fortune and fame of Augustus. <hi rend="smallcap">Hazlitt</hi>
              (p. 102): Shakespeare's genius has spread over the whole play a richness like the
              overflowing of the Nile. </p>
            <p>6. <hi rend="bold">Nay, but,</hi> etc.] Shakespeare's art in beginning his plays in
              the midst of a dialogue is so skilful that there is a certain feeling of loss, as
              though we had been deprived of some pleasing conversation; and that if we had come
              only a minute sooner, we should have heard something entertaining. Thus <hi

              at once that Shakespeare has here blundered. At the same time, might we not admit that
              after Shakespeare has used a word twice in an intelligible though illogical sense, the
              word might as well be adopted into the language for daily use? It would have a
              paternity which many a perfectly legitimate word might be content to own.

              was right, and believes &lsquo;that &ldquo;pillar&rdquo; requires

              &lsquo;Warburton's conjecture is ingenious,&rsquo; he says (p. 317),
              &lsquo;and would be a probable reading, if the scene opening had discovered Antony
              with Cleopatra on his lap. But, represented as he is walking and jesting with her,
              &ldquo;fool&rdquo; must be the word. Warburton's objection is shallow, and
              implies that he confounded the dramatic with the epic style. The
              &ldquo;pillar&rdquo; of a state is so common a metaphor as to have lost the

              to Imogen! One would think it almost impossible for the same person to have drawn
              both. She is voluptuous, ostentatious, conscious, boastful of her charms, haughty,
              tyrannical, fickle. The luxurious pomp and gorgeous extravagance of the Egyptian queen
              are displayed in all their force and lustre, as well as the irregular grandeur of the
              soul of Mark Antony. Take only the first four lines that they speak as an example of
              the regal style of love-making. </p>

              Jameson</hi> (ii, 150): The character of </p>
            <p>Mark Antony, as delineated by Shakespeare, reminds me of the Farnese Hercules. There
              is an ostentatious display of power, an exaggerated grandeur, a colossal effect in the
              whole conception, sustained throughout in the pomp of the language, which seems, as it
              flows along, to resound with the clang of arms and the music of the revel. The
              coarseness and violence of the historic portrait are a little kept down; but every
              word which Antony utters is characteristic of the arrogant but magnanimous Roman, who
              &lsquo;with half the bulk o' the world played as he pleased,&rsquo; and was
              himself the sport of a host of mad (and bad) passions, and the slave of a woman.

              count their worth&rsquo; (II, vi, 32), and Claudio's, &lsquo;I were but little

              a quotation from Ovid (<hi rend="italic">Meta.</hi> xiii, 824) which is possibly
              parallel. It is where Polyphemus is boasting to Galatea of his wealth in flocks and
              herds;&mdash;&lsquo;All this flock is my own; many others are roaming the
              valleys; Many are hid in the forest, and many are stabled in caverns. Should you ask
              how many there are, I should not be able to tell you. To number the tale of his flock
              is ever the mark of a poor man.&rsquo; &lsquo;Hoc pecus omne meum est: multae
              quoque vallibus errant; Multas silva tegit: multae stabulantur in antris: Nec, si
              forte roges, possim tibi dicere, quot sint. Pauperis est numerare pecus.&rsquo;
              Golding's translation (p. 170 <hi rend="italic">verso</hi>), more vigorous than mine,
              is as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;This Cattell heere is all myne owne. And many mo

              cannot showe. Tush beggars of theyr Cattell vse the number for too knowe.&rsquo;
              Steevens quotes also from an Epigram, wholly apposite, where Martial (Bk. vi, No. 34)
              begs for kisses, and in answer to the question &lsquo;how many?&rsquo;
              answers, &lsquo;bid me number ocean's waves, or the shells scattered on the
              &AElig;gean shore, or the number of bees wandering on the Cecropian mount, or the
              number of voices and applauding hands when the people catch sight of C&aelig;sar's
              face in the crowded theatre. I do not want as many as the clever Catullus begged from
              Lesbia, that is, any definite number, however vast, because &lsquo;pauca cupit,

              the same, whatever the punctuation, namely, that the sum, and not the particulars, of
              the news is to be delivered. If there be, however, an inversion, as Mr Thiselton
              contends, it is used for dramatic effect, and, it seems to me, that this effect will
              be heightened in proportion as the punctuation is emphatic, even to the conversion, as
              in the majority of modern texts, of the comma into a full stop. Time should be given

              Fulvia was first married to P. Clodius, by whom she had a daughter, Claudia,
              afterwards the wife of C&aelig;sar Octavius. When Clodius was murdered, she
              married C. Scribonius Curio; and after his fall in Africa, she lived for some years as
              a widow, until about <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 44 she married M. Antony, by whom
              she became the mother of two sons. Up to the time of her marrying Antony, she had been
              a woman of most dissolute conduct, but henceforth she clung to Antony with the most
              passionate attachment, and her only ambition was to see her husband occupy the first
              place in the republic, at whatever cost that position might be purchased. When Antony
              was declared a public enemy, she addressed the most humble entreaties to the Senate,
              praying that they might alter their resolution. Her brutal conduct during the fearful
              proscriptions of <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 43 is well known; she gazed with
              delight upon the head of Cicero, the victim of her husband. In <hi rend="smallcap"
                >b.c.</hi> 40, while Antony was revelling with Cleopatra in all the luxuries of the
              East, Fulvia, stimulated partly by jealousy and the desire of drawing Antony </p>
            <p>back to Italy, and partly by her hostility towards Octavius, resolved upon raising a
              commotion in Italy. She induced L. Antonius, her husband's brother, to come forward as
              the protector of those who were oppressed and reduced to poverty by the colonies of
              Octavius. He took his post at Praeneste whither he was followed by Fulvia. She
              afterwards followed him to Perusia, and endeavoured to rouse the inhabitants of the
              north of Italy to assist him, while he was besieged at Perusia by Octavius. When
              Perusia fell into the hands of Octavius, by the treachery of L. Antonius, Fulvia was
              permitted to escape, and went to Brundusium, where she embarked for Greece. Her
              husband, who had in the meantime been informed of the war of Perusia and its result,
              was on his way to Italy. He met Fulvia at Athens, and censured her severely for having
              caused the disturbance. It is said that, from grief at his rough treatment, she was
              taken ill, and in this state he left her at Sicyon while he went to Brundusium. Her
              feelings were so deeply wounded by her husband's conduct, that she took no care of
              herself, and soon after died at Sicyon, <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 40. The news of
              her death came very opportunely for the Triumvirs, who now formed a reconciliation,
              which was cemented by Antony marrying the noble-minded Octavia. </p>

              </lemma> I can recall but one solitary passage in all Shakespeare where there is the
              need, within the scene, of a stage-direction, namely: in Hamlet's interview with
              Ophelia when Polonius and the King are concealed behind the arras, &mdash;and
              there the lack is indeed deplorable. But elsewhere the context, together </p>
            <p>with that wherewith Northcote said he mixed his colours:
              &lsquo;brains,&rsquo; will supply an actor with the appropriate
              &lsquo;business.&rsquo; In the present line, after &lsquo;thus,&rsquo;
                <hi rend="smallcap">Pope</hi> inserted the stage-direction &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">embracing,</hi>&rsquo; and has been followed by every editor, I
              think, from that day to this. I do not forget how much more childlike than at present
              were the men and women of aforetime, whether in the days of the C&aelig;sars or in
              the days of Elizabeth, in the outward expression of their emotion, by embracing, by
              kissing, or by the enviable gift, at command, of profuse and prolonged tears. But even
              with this in mind, is it to be considered likely that Anthony would here publicly
              kiss, embrace, or even touch Cleopatra? She was wrangling with him,&mdash;teasing
              him almost past endurance, determined to obtain from him some assurance that, whatever
              the message &longs;rom Rome, he would not leave her; and is it in character that
              she should tamely submit to be &lsquo;embraced?&rsquo; and then, when released
              from Anthony's arms, where she had lain like an unresisting dove, renew the wrangling
              which this &lsquo;embrace&rsquo; had interrupted? All wrangling thereafter
              would be absolutely stingless. They were not standing side by side. Quarrels are not
              so conducted. They were facing each other, and, I imagine, by some such gesture as an
              obeisance and a sweeping wave of both hands toward her,&mdash;a not uncommon mode
              of illustrating &lsquo;thus,&rsquo; &mdash;he showed that his whole
              existence with her, day by day and hour by hour, was the true nobleness of life,
              compared to which kingdoms are clay. In speaking above of stage-directions, I refer to
              situations where a key is urgently needed. There are, in the Ff and Qq, many

              me to be the true interpretation: &lsquo;Antony accepts Cleopatra's belief of what
              he will be. He will be himself; but still under the influence of Cleopatra; and to
              show what that influence is, he continues, &ldquo;Now for the love of
              Love,&rdquo; etc.&rsquo; <hi rend="smallcap">Abbott</hi> quotes this passage
              under &sect; 128, and gives the meaning of &lsquo;but&rsquo; as equivalent

              more than doubtful. The whole difficulty arises, I think, from failing to apprehend
              the meaning of Cleopatra's last words. &lsquo;I'll seem the fool I am
              not,&rsquo; she says, and then adds contemptuously, &lsquo;Antony will be the
              fool he really is.&rsquo; He parries the stab, and tries, unsuccessfully, to
              propitiate her by acknowledging that he will be that same fool, but stirr'd to his
              very soul by love for Cleopatra. Then follows the exquisite music of the next four
              lines, to which there came in reply only the exasperating parrot-cry, &lsquo;Hear

              believe that there lies herein the faintest reference to the queen of love or to her
              boy. The expression &lsquo;love of love&rsquo; means, I think, the love of
              love in the abstract, the very soul of love; just as Hamlet, by &lsquo;heart of

              <hi rend="smallcap">Delius</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sh. Jahrbuch,</hi> V, 267): The
              frivolous conversation of Cleopatra's court, expressive of the thoughtless life there,
              is carried on in prose. The soothsayer, in expounding the value of his prophecies, is
              the only one who uses blank verse. On the appearance of the impassioned Cleopatra
              language assumes a higher strain and blank verse is then used by the others. In the
              dialogue, at the conclusion of the Scene, between Antony and his trusty Enobarbus, the
              latter as the representative of the more elevated humour of the play, speaks in prose,
              in which his satirical remarks on Cleopatra and Fulvia are certainly appropriate.
              Antony himself barely responds to this mood and style of his friend. </p>

                >Parthenon,</hi> 17 May, 1862): It seems to me that when Warburton offered an
              explanation of Shakespeare's meaning, he also well-nigh restored, unconsciously, the
              very words of the dramatist. He says the horns of Charmian's husband must be
              &lsquo;hung about&rsquo; with garlands. Now <hi rend="italic">hang</hi> was
              anciently spelt <hi rend="italic">hange,</hi> and, although this orthography was dying
              out at the date of this tragedy, the omission or insertion of the final <hi
                rend="italic">e</hi> depended pretty much on the caprice of the compositor. It can
              scarcely then be deemed unreasonable to conclude that the play-house copy from which
              this tragedy was probably printed would have shown Shakespeare's words to have been
              &lsquo;must <hi rend="italic">hange</hi> his Horns with Garlands.&rsquo; . . .
              The insertion of a superfluous initial letter was equally likely as a source of error
              . . . We find in the old copies of this play, &lsquo;'<hi rend="italic">t</hi>is
              well,&rsquo; where Shakespeare must have written &lsquo;is well,&rsquo;
              and &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">s</hi>tow me after&rsquo; for &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">tow</hi> me after.&rsquo; <hi rend="smallcap">Staunton</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Athen&aelig;um,</hi> 12 April, 1873): &lsquo;Change&rsquo;
              is unquestionably a misprint for <hi rend="italic">chain</hi>&mdash;of old spelt
                <hi rend="italic">chayne.</hi> The allusion is to the sacrificial ox, whose horns
              were wreathed with flowers. [It is to be regretted that Staunton did not know </p>
            <p>that he was herein anticipated by Zachary Jackson; else, rather than be seen in such
              company, he would have withheld his hand. Inasmuch as two editors, as eminently
              respectable as Knight and Staunton, have decided that &lsquo;change&rsquo; is
              intelligible, the obscurity cannot be so desperate as to demand the substitution of
              another word, nor is there a sufficient reason to disregard the wholesome rule that
              the more difficult reading is to be preferred. We must remember that the thought,
              whatever may be the words, is not that of Charmian, but of Alexas, who has evidently
              taunted the giddy girls with indulging in frivolity to its extremest
              limit,&mdash;even to the unparalleled limit of indifferently changing the symbols
              of disgrace with the chaplets of marriage. I cannot see any reason for adopting
              Theobald's emendation, which, moreover, seems to make the husband an active agent in
              loading his horns with flowers,&mdash;a task which is not generally supposed to
              fall to his share.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              <hi rend="smallcap">Th. Zielinski</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Philologus,</hi> p. 19):
              Shakespeare imagined Charmion as younger than her mistress; the age of fifty, then,
              would bring her to the birth of Christ. Is it clear who that child is &lsquo;to
              whom Herode of Iewry may do homage&rsquo;? In Matthew, ii, 8, Herod himself says
              &lsquo;Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him,
              bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.&rsquo; And to whom does
              he say this? To the &lsquo;Holy Three Kings.&rsquo; Are not these the same
              that are included in the list of Charmion's wishes? The fancy deserves a
              Mystery:&mdash;wife to the Holy Three Kings, the mother of God, and, withal,
              Empress of Rome. [It is by no means easy to disprove this interpretation, which at
              first decidedly shocks us. It is unavailing to appeal to the text of the Scriptures,
              where, in the Bishop's Bible of 1568,&mdash;the Version used by
              Shakespeare,&mdash;the Magi are termed, not Kings but &lsquo;Wise
              men&rsquo;; these Wise men had been called &lsquo;Kings&rsquo; centuries
              before Shakespeare was born, and as such had been familiar characters in Christmas
              carols throughout England, and, possibly, are so, to this day. It is also possible
              that any allusion whatever to &lsquo;Three Kings&rsquo; would at once have
              suggested to Shakespeare's audience the &lsquo;three wise men.&rsquo;
              Furthermore, the &lsquo;Three Kings&rsquo; must here be considered as a unit
              or as a single group; Charmian was to be married to them all at once or in one
              forenoon. This play opens in <hi rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 40 and extends to <hi
                rend="smallcap">b.c.</hi> 32; if Charmian be now eighteen or twenty, she will be
              fifty in the year when Christ was born. The references to Herod and the verse in
              Matthew are a little staggering. I do not like this interpretation; it more than
              grates me. It imparts to Charmian's words an air of frivolous irreverence, which is to
              me un-Shakespearian. But there is never anything uttered at random by any of
              Shakespeare's characters, and the chances are many against this wish of Charmian's
              being spoken at haphazard and tallying at the same time so exactly with dates.
              Whenever an allusion is thrown out, we must catch it of ourselves; Shakespeare will
              not point it out to us. It is to be feared that there is many an allusion in his
              plays, less pointed than this, which critics have accepted and approved.&mdash;<hi

              <hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: Herod paid homage to the Romans, to procure the
              grant of the kingdom of Judea: I believe there is an allusion here to the theatrical
              character of this monarch, and to a proverbial expression founded on it. Herod was
              always one of the personages in the Mysteries of our early stage, on which </p>
            <p>he was constantly represented as a fierce, haughty, blustering tyrant, so that
              &lsquo;Herod of Jewry&rsquo; became a common proverb, expressive of turbulence
              and rage. Thus, Hamlet says of a ranting player, that he &lsquo;<hi rend="italic"
                >out-herods</hi> Herod.&rsquo; And, in this tragedy, Alexas tells Cleopatra
              [III, iii, 6] that &lsquo;not even <hi rend="italic">Herod of Jewry</hi> dare look
              upon her when she is angry;&rsquo; i. e. not even a man as fierce as Herod.
              According to this explanation, the sense of the present passage will
              be&mdash;Charmian wishes for a son who may arrive at such power and dominion that
              the proudest and fiercest monarchs of the earth may be brought under his yoke. [That
              this is the specific, theatrical Herod to whom Charmian refers has been universally
              accepted, and will probably so remain, in spite of the preceding ingenious
                note.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              in order to be appreciated, it must be seen on the printed page, a pleasure, which, in
              this play, Shakespeare probably never enjoyed. And in the meantime what becomes of
              Delius's fine-spun theory in regard to prose and verse? Every line of this portion of
              the scene must be stark prose, or for poor Delius, &lsquo;all's had, nought's

              (p. 157) in substance:&mdash;&lsquo;The fact is evidently this: Alexas brings
              a fortune-teller to Iras and Charmian, and says himself, &ldquo;We'll know all our
              fortunes.&rdquo; Well; the Soothsayer begins with the women; and some jokes pass
              upon the subject of husbands and chastity: after which, the women hoping for the
              satisfaction of having something to laugh at in Alexas's fortune, call him to hold out
              his hand, and wish heartily that he may have the prognostication of cuckoldom upon
              him. The whole speech, therefore, must be placed to Charmian. There needs no stronger
              proof of this being a true correction, than the observations which Alexas immediately
              subjoins on their wishes and zeal to hear him abused.&rsquo; Theobald's <hi
                rend="italic">Shakespeare Restored</hi> was published in 1726; two years afterward
              appeared Pope's <hi rend="italic">Second Edition</hi> wherein the Editor was forced to
              adopt many, very many of Theobald's corrections. It looks, in the present passage, as
              though Pope, smarting under the judicious slashes which Theobald administered, was
              determined to adopt as little of Theobald's emendation as possible. He therefore
              omitted the name &lsquo;Alexas&rsquo; altogether, and by Italics tried to make
              Charmian's speech apply to him, thus: &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Char.</hi> Our

              bring forth weeds; but the telling us of our faults is a kind of culture to

              belonging to us, not merely an external object, as the <hi rend="italic">wind</hi> is.
              To talk of <hi rend="italic">quick</hi> winds lying <hi rend="italic">still,</hi> is
              little better than nonsense. <hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: Dr Johnson's explanation
              is certainly true of <hi rend="italic">soil,</hi> but where did Dr Johnson find the

                >winds,</hi> and was forced to substitute <hi rend="italic">soil ventilated by

              the plough, are termed <hi rend="italic">wind</hi>-rows;&rsquo; though surely the
              obvious explication of the latter word, <hi rend="italic">rows exposed to the

              &lsquo;winds&rsquo;]: When do we &lsquo;bring forth weeds&rsquo;? In a
              heavy and moist season, when there are no &lsquo;quick winds&rsquo; to mellow
              the earth, to dry up the exuberant moisture, to fit it for the plough. The poet knew
              the old proverb of the worth of a bushel of March dust; but &lsquo;the winds of
              March,&rsquo; rough and unpleasant as they are, he knew also produced this good.
              The quick winds then are the voices which bring us true reports to put an end to our
              inaction. When these winds lie still we bring forth weeds. But the metaphor is carried
              farther: the winds have rendered the soil fit for the plough; but the knowledge of our
              own faults,&mdash;ills,&mdash; is as the ploughing itself,&mdash;the
              &lsquo;earing.&rsquo; <hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> [reading

                <hi rend="italic">wints,</hi> which in Kent and Sussex is an agricultural term (in
              other parts of the country called a <hi rend="italic">bout</hi>), meaning
              &lsquo;two furrows ploughed by the horses going to one end of the field and back
              again.&rsquo; See Cooper's <hi rend="italic">Sussex Glossary,</hi> 1836; also
              Holloway's <hi rend="italic">General Provincial Dictionary,</hi> 1838. &lsquo;Our
              quick winds,&rsquo; therefore, is to be understood as our <hi rend="italic"
                >productive soil.</hi> &lsquo;Earing&rsquo; is ploughing; and its use shows
              that Anthony had agriculture in his thoughts, with reference to

              <hi rend="smallcap">Staunton</hi> [reading &lsquo;winds&rsquo;]: Warburton's
              change is, perhaps, without necessity. &lsquo;Quick winds&rsquo; may mean <hi
                rend="italic">quickening winds,</hi> and Johnson's explanation of the passage is
              possibly the true one. <hi rend="smallcap">Deighton</hi> [reading <hi rend="italic"
                >winds</hi>]: It is when our active minds are allowed to lie untilled by wholesome
              truths that they shoot up noxious growths, and the telling us of our faults is as the
              ploughing of the soil which roots up such growths. [To me an insuperable difficulty in
              accepting &lsquo;winds&rsquo; is the possessive pronoun
              &lsquo;our.&rsquo; I do not know what these winds are, which we possess and,
              if quiescent, suffer us to bring forth weeds. The agency of our reformation comes </p>
            <p>to us from without, and even then not by arousing these still winds, but by
              husbandry. Could Shakespeare, could any one, suppose that weeds were killed by the
              wind? more especially by a quick wind, one that is full of life? And can a wind
              discriminate between weeds and wheat, kill the one and foster the other? Whereas by
              accepting <hi rend="italic">minds</hi> instead of &lsquo;windes,&rsquo; all is

              <hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: I once idly supposed that Shakespeare
              wrote&mdash;&lsquo;We cannot call her sighs and tears, winds and
              waters;&rsquo;&mdash;which is certainly the phraseology we should now use. . .
              . The passage, however, may be understood without any inversion. &lsquo;We cannot
              call the clamourous heavings of her breast, and the copious streams which flow from
              her eyes, by the ordinary name of sighs and tears; they are greater storms,&rsquo;
              etc. [It is doubtful that Zachary Jackson, or his copesmate Andrew Becket, or Lord
              Chedworth, who makes a good third, ever wrote a more <hi rend="italic">trying</hi>
              note than this of Malone. In supposing this sentence of Enobarbus to be inverted,
              Malone betrayed his misapprehension of its meaning, and I think that he made his
              feeble conjecture before he had read the rest of the speech. If, in speaking of Mont
              Blanc we should say &lsquo;we cannot call Mont Blanc a molehill&rsquo; is
              there any phraseology of any time or of any people in which this expression would be
              termed an inversion? However, before he finished his comment Malone discovered his
              error, but he should have cancelled the first portion of his note.&mdash;<hi

              &lsquo;Shews&rsquo; them to him in the sense, probably, of sending him to

              dress; and that a change every little while in that behalf is as pleasant as having a

              MS a decided improvement on that of the Folio, of which, he says, &lsquo;there can
              be no dispute that [its] mode of pointing the passage is wrong,&rsquo;&mdash;
              an assertion, on the part of a veteran editor, so strange, that though it stands off
              as gross as black and white, my eye will scarcely see it. As if there were a phrase, a
              word, a comma in Shakespeare about which &lsquo;there can be no
              dispute&rsquo;! And, moreover, Collier was unfortunate in making so extravagant a
              claim for his MS in this passage, of all passages, where the majority of editors in
              favour of the original punctuation is so very heavy. The majority has not erred, I
              think. Never would Cleopatra have uttered so tame, so dispassionate a sentence as that
              which Collier and his MS offer to us: &lsquo;thou teachest, like a fool, the way
              to lose him.&rsquo; If the Folio err in punctuation, it errs on the side of
              moderation. Instead of a colon after &lsquo;foole,&rsquo; I think a period

              mean to tell me.&rsquo; It is to be observed that Cleopatra as yet knows nothing
              of the nature of the news from Rome which had aroused Anthony. She had only concluded
              &lsquo;A Romane thought hath strooke him&rsquo; from a sudden subsidence of
              his mirth, and she infers that the news probably involves his speedy departure, and is
              really welcome to him as importing reconciliation with C&aelig;sar. Fulvia and
              Lucius had been at war with the latter, and Cleopatra believes or pretends to believe
              that it has been Fulvia's wish that Anthony should keep out of the way, and that it
              was merely owing to this that he was able to dance attendance on herself. [Rowe's

              lxiv, Hft. i, p. 17): In this farewell scene between Anthony and Cleopatra Shakespeare
              had in mind Ovid's <hi rend="italic">Epistle of Dido to &AElig;neas.</hi> First of
              all, the situations are exactly analogous, as every one may see at once; even the Poet
              himself acknowledges it, where he says: &lsquo;Dido and her &AElig;neas shall
              want troops.&rsquo; etc. IV, xiv, 64. Shakespeare's Cleopatra is developed
              psychologically, not from the Vergilian, but from the Ovidian Dido; from the latter
              she derives her nervousness, although she derives from the English poet,&mdash;or
              rather from Plutarch, &mdash;that fatal admixture of instinctive, foxlike slyness,
              which Ovid's heroine lacks. Special points of resemblance the student will find for
              himself; the most noteworthy </p>
            <p>occurs in line 139 of Ovid's <hi rend="italic">Epistola VII: Dido
                &AElig;ne&aelig;:</hi>&mdash;&lsquo;Sed jubet ire deus. Vellem
              vetuisset adire.&rsquo; [Undoubtedly, in this one solitary line there is found a
              notable parallelism between Dido's words and Cleopatra's; but the antithesis between
                <hi rend="italic">going</hi> and <hi rend="italic">coming</hi> is in itself so
              marked that it might almost be said to be one of daily use. As to the
              &lsquo;special points of resemblance which the student will find for
              himself,&rsquo; I can merely humbly acknowledge that I have scrutinized closely
              every line of Ovid's <hi rend="italic">Epistle,</hi> and if there be another
              parallelism there, it has escaped me. Not so, however, Zielinski; one passage there is
              whereto he detects a second parallel in this present scene. The passage is, I suppose,
              for he does not specify it:&mdash;&lsquo;Forsitan et gravidam Dido, scelerate,
              relinquas, Parsque tui lateat corpore clausa meo.&rsquo;&mdash;123, 124. This
              &lsquo;clausa pars&rsquo; Zielinski finds in the &lsquo;one
              word,&rsquo; which Cleopatra is at a loss to pronounce, in lines 108-113, until at
              last Zielinski reveals it for her in &lsquo;Oh, my <hi rend="italic">oblivion</hi>
              is <hi rend="italic">a very Anthony.</hi>&rsquo; Thereupon, after a little gentle
              derision of the commentators for their obtuseness, he finds further confirmation where
              Cleopatra says, &lsquo;'Tis sweating labour <hi rend="italic">To bear such
                idleness so near the heart,</hi> As Cleopatra <hi rend="italic"
              >this.</hi>&rsquo; &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">This,</hi>&rsquo; Zielinski
              suggests, was accompanied by &lsquo;a discreet significant gesture;&rsquo;
                <foreign lang="greek">deiktikw_s</foreign>, as Aristotle has it.
              &lsquo;Verily,&rsquo; he says, in conclusion, &lsquo;a poet understands a
              poet better than the critics understand him; I refer to Puschkin, who has openly
              imitated these words of Cleopatra in a passage in his lovely
              &ldquo;Nixe&rdquo; (Rusalka): &ldquo;<hi rend="italic"

              untranslated. For those who read German, a translation is needless, and for those who
              do not, the loss is less than trifling. I think I ought to add that Warburton appears
              to have had the same idea as Zielinski. See note 114-116 <hi rend="italic"

              Cleopatra had just cast a doubt on Antony's love; he bids her give &lsquo;true

                rend="italic">principal</hi> of the house of the Antonii? [Here follows the passage
              from Plutarch, referred to in the preceding note. Twenty years later, Staunton (<hi
                rend="italic">Athen.</hi> 12 April, 1873) upheld his emendation, and closed his
              remarks, in substance the same as in his note just given, with the assertion that
              Shakespeare &lsquo;puts into the mouth of Cleopatra the stinging taunt,
              &mdash;&ldquo;How this <hi rend="italic">Herculean Roman</hi> does become the
              carriage of his chief.&rdquo; A sarcasm which is rendered absolutely pointless by
              the fatuous reading of the old text.&rsquo;] <hi rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi>: This
              is obscure. But Cleopatra here assumes that Anthony is but playing a </p>
            <p>part; that his passion is put on for effect. So, if the text be right, the meaning, I
              think, must be, &lsquo;look how well he <hi rend="italic">carries out</hi> the
              resemblance or make-believe of <hi rend="italic">being chafed</hi> at my
              words.&rsquo; <hi rend="smallcap">Deighton</hi>: That is, see what full justice he
              does to the part he has to play of being in a rage; how well he carries out his
              assumed role. <hi rend="smallcap">Mrs Jameson</hi> (ii, 130): This is, indeed, most
              &lsquo;excellent dissembling;&rsquo; but when she has fooled and chafed the
              Herculean Roman to the verge of danger, then comes that return of tenderness which
              secures the power she has tried to the utmost, and we have all the elegant, the
              poetical Cleopatra in her beautiful farewell. [Although these words are a part of the
              irritating appeal to Charmian, yet they give in one particular word the first hint
              that Cleopatra is relenting and that her mood is changing. In her very next speech she
              is utterly subdued and is the gentle, caressing, heartbroken queen, whose very soul is
              lost and forgotten in Anthony. It would be unnatural to represent this change as
              taking place as swift as the lightning in the collied night, as it would be were it
              preceded by a &lsquo;stinging taunt&rsquo; and &lsquo;sarcasm.&rsquo;
              The indication of a change, which though swift, is still gradual, lies in the word
              &lsquo;chafe,&rsquo; &mdash;it is Cleopatra's confession that she has been
              merely teasing; when she speaks in earnest she lacks words to tell her love, but
              hitherto it has been mere fun&mdash;&lsquo;Look, Charmian,&rsquo; she
              says, in effect, &lsquo;how becoming it is to this Herculean Roman to have to bear
              a little teasing;&rsquo; or, in modern slang (perilously near
              &lsquo;chafe&rsquo;) &lsquo;to bear a little <hi rend="italic"
              >chaff.</hi>&rsquo; Of course, it is not to be supposed that, however bewitching
              the smile which accompanies these words, Anthony is at once appeased. No man likes to
              be told that he has been teased, although teasing is better than venom. So Anthony is
              dignified and calls Cleopatra &lsquo;lady&rsquo; and is almost ludicrously
              sarcastic in his next speech. But,&mdash;he is limed. The &lsquo;infinite

              may it not be that Cleopatra means that she is so utterly lost, heart and soul and

              (i, 29): Did I not know, says Antony, what a mistress you are in the arts of
              dissembling, and of counterfeiting any idle humour you please, I should take the
              wantonness of your present behaviour for real wantonness, and accuse you of little
              feeling; and with this interpretation, the answer of Cleopatra quadrates perfectly;
              for it amounts to an avowal&mdash;that she had indeed been acting a part, and that
              with the greatest constraint, and most painfully to herself; her motive, as she would
              have it thought,&mdash;to keep up Antony's spirits, and her own, in such a trying
              juncture as this of their parting. <hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: Warburton's
              explanation is a very coarse one. The sense may be:&mdash;But that your queenship
              chooses idleness for the subject of your conversation, I should take you for idleness
              itself. Or an antithesis may be designed between <emph>royalty</emph> and
                <emph>subject.</emph> But that I know you to be a queen, and that your royalty holds
              idleness in subjection to you, exalting you far above its influence, I should suppose
              you to be the very genius of idleness itself. <hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: But
              perhaps <hi rend="italic">your subject</hi> rather means, whom being in subjection to
              you, you can command at pleasure, &lsquo;to do your bidding,&rsquo; to assume
              the airs of coquetry, etc. Were not this coquet one of your attendants, I should

              other, of designing to get rid of his partners, and govern singly: The passage being

              retaining &lsquo;One&rsquo; the inference becomes not unfair that it is
              C&aelig;sar's natural vice to hate many competitors. The whole sentence seems
              either carelessly written or else dependent on the contents of the letter which
              C&aelig;sar has just read. &lsquo;Vice&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;hate&rsquo; both seem stronger than the occasion demands. It is not a
              &lsquo;vice&rsquo; to disapprove of immorality; nor is it natural that the

              be pronounced as a monosyllable, if &lsquo;Our&rsquo; be a disyllable. And in

              </lemma> One of the most valuable of <hi rend="smallcap">Walker's</hi> chapters, as
              has been remarked in almost every volume of this edition, is that &lsquo;on the
              frequent interpolation, and frequent omission, of the final <hi rend="italic"
              >s,</hi>&rsquo; in the first Folio. &lsquo;The interpolation of an <hi
                rend="italic">s</hi> at the end of a word,&rsquo; says Walker (<hi rend="italic"
                >Crit.</hi> i, 234), &lsquo;&mdash;generally, but not always, a </p>
            <p>noun substantive,&mdash;is remarkably frequent in the Folio. Those who are
              conversant with the MS of the Elizabethan age may perhaps be able to explain its
              origin. Were it not for the different degree of frequency with which it occurs in
              different parts of the Folio,&mdash;being comparatively rare in the Comedies
              (except perhaps in <hi rend="italic">The Winter's Tale</hi>), appearing more
              frequently in the Histories, and becoming quite common in the Tragedies,&mdash;I
              should be inclined to think it originated in some peculiarity of Shakespeare's
              handwriting.&rsquo; This possible &lsquo;peculiarity&rsquo; of
              Shakespeare's handwriting does not interfere with the suggestion that the compositors
              composed by the ear. Any &lsquo;peculiarity&rsquo; in the MS would mislead the
              reader, whether or not he was at the same time the compositor. Other instances of this

              reflection is necessary, ere it can be seen: The night in which Antony's faults were
              set, and by which they were render'd more glaring, is&mdash;the turbulent state of
              affairs, and the storm that was then arisen from Pompey. <hi rend="smallcap"
              >Johnson</hi>: If by spots are meant stars, as night has no other fiery spots, the
              comparison is forced and harsh, stars having been always supposed to beautify the
              night; nor do I comprehend what there is in the counterpart of this simile, which
              answers to night's blackness. <hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: The meaning seems to
              be&mdash;&lsquo;As the stars or spots of heaven are not obscured, but rather
              rendered more bright, by the blackness of the night, so neither is the goodness of
              Antony eclipsed by his evil qualities, but, on the contrary, his faults seem enlarged
              and aggravated by his virtues. That which answers to the <hi rend="italic">blackness
                of the night,</hi> in the counterpart of the simile, is <hi rend="italic">Antony's
                goodness.</hi> His goodness is a ground which gives a relief to his faults, and
              makes them stand out more prominent and conspicuous. It is objected, that stars rather
              beautify than deform the night. But the poet considers them here only with respect to
              their <hi rend="italic">prominence and splendour.</hi> It is sufficient for him that

              maturity of knowledge to regulate their own conduct, sacrifice to their present
              pleasure, the experience they have had of the ill consequences which will certainly
              follow from such indulgence, and thus rebel against their own judgment. According to
              Hanmer's reading, the fault of the boy is said to proceed from the immaturity of his
              knowledge, that is, want of sufficient experience to teach him that knowledge, at the
              same time that he is said to have that experience, and to act in contradiction to it,
              and to his judgment founded upon it. <hi rend="smallcap">Capell</hi> (i, 30):
              &lsquo;Being mature&rsquo; has been chang'd into&mdash;<hi rend="italic"
                >immature</hi>: but &lsquo;boys&rsquo; are not usually
              &lsquo;rated&rsquo; for faults before they are of years to know better; nor
              can they &lsquo;rebel to judgment,&rsquo; till such time as they have some.
                <hi rend="smallcap">Johnson</hi>: By &lsquo;boys mature in knowledge&rsquo;
              are meant, boys old enough to know their duty. <hi rend="smallcap">R. G. White</hi>
              (ed. i): Hanmer's reading, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">immature</hi> in
              knowledge&rsquo; is most plausible. For boys are not mature in anything, and least
              in knowledge; and were they mature they would not pawn their experience to their
              present pleasure; or at least their so doing would not be chosen as an illustration
              here. Without an equivalent to Hanmer's too great change, the passage appears to be
              inexplicable. <hi rend="smallcap">Daniel</hi> (p. 80): Read these four lines thus:
              &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash; <hi rend="italic">he's</hi> to be chid As we rate

                <hi rend="italic">his</hi> present pleasure, And so <hi rend="italic">rebels</hi> to
              judgment.&rsquo; Boys are not mature in knowledge, and cannot pawn experience nor
              rebel against judgment they do not possess; but Antony being so, and doing thus, is to
              be chidden as a boy. J[<hi rend="smallcap">oseph</hi>] C[<hi rend="smallcap"
              >rosby</hi>] (<hi rend="italic">N. &amp; Qu.</hi> V, vii, 464, 1877): The only
              objection to Daniel's emendation is that it makes no less than five changes in the
              original text. But the same sense and construction may be obtained by only one
              alteration, and that a very slight one,&mdash;viz. by reading <hi rend="italic"
                >They're</hi> for &lsquo;'tis,&rsquo;&mdash;placing the parenthetical
              clause between dashes, and closing the first sentence with a note of exclamation after
              &lsquo;ours,&rsquo; thus:&mdash;&lsquo;As his own state and ours! <hi
                rend="italic">They're</hi> to be chid&mdash;As we rate boys&mdash;who, being
              mature in knowledge,&rsquo; etc. By this arrangement and pointing, it will be seen </p>
            <p>at once that &lsquo;As we rate boys&rsquo; is to be construed as a
              parenthesis, and that &lsquo;who&rsquo; has for its antecedent
              &lsquo;they&rsquo; of the previous line, viz. persons generally who do
              soand-so, and does not in any way refer to &lsquo;boys.&rsquo; [<hi
                rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi> adopted this emendation of Crosby in his text. I cannot
              but believe that recent editors would have found less difficulty in these lines had
              they only followed the punctuation of the Folio, with a colon after
              &lsquo;chid,&rsquo; instead of adopting Capell's text where is no punctuation
              after &lsquo;chid.&rsquo; With &lsquo;chid&rsquo; the sense is
              complete,&mdash;Anthony's conduct deserves to be chidden. Then the simile begins.
              It seems to me idle to discuss whether or not boys in general are mature or immature.
              The &lsquo;boys&rsquo; that Shakespeare had in mind in this passage <hi

              &lsquo;Boys&rsquo; is an elastic term. Later on, Anthony calls C&aelig;sar
              a &lsquo;boy.&rsquo; Compared with Anthony's fifty-two years thirty-two years
              may well be a boy's span, and can any one say that such a &lsquo;boy&rsquo;

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Warburton</hi>: Let us examine the sense of this in plain prose:
              &lsquo;The earliest histories inform us, that the man in supreme command was
              always wish'd to gain that command, till he had obtain'd it. And he, whom the
              multitude has contentedly seen in a low condition, when he begins to be wanted by
              them, becomes to be &ldquo;fear'd&rdquo; by them.&rsquo; But do the
              multitude fear a man because they want him? Certainly, we must read: &lsquo;Comes
                <hi rend="italic">dear'd,</hi> by being lacked,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i.
              e.</hi> endear'd, a favourite to them. Besides, the context requires this reading; for
              it was not fear, but love, that made the people flock to young Pompey and what
              occasioned this reflection. So in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus:</hi> &lsquo;I
              shall be <hi rend="italic">lov'd,</hi> when I am lack'd.&rsquo; <hi
                rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: Something, however, is yet wanting. What is the meaning
              of &mdash;&lsquo;ne'er lov'd till <hi rend="italic">ne'er</hi> worth
              love?&rsquo; I suppose that the second &lsquo;ne'er&rsquo; was
              inadvertently repeated at the press, and that we should read &lsquo;till <hi
                rend="italic">not</hi> worth love.&rsquo; <hi rend="smallcap">Knight</hi> [who
              follows the Folio]: The general reading is <hi rend="italic">dear'd.</hi> But it must
              be remembered that C&aelig;sar is speaking; and that, in the notions of one who
              aims at supreme authority, to be feared and to be loved are pretty synonymous. <hi
                rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> (ed. i, also following the Folio): Warburton's
              alteration is plausible, but does not seem necessary. C&aelig;sar may mean, that
              Pompey, by being so much backed by the people, has become powerful, and is therefore
              &lsquo;fear'd.&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> (ed. ii, adopting <hi
                rend="italic">lov'd</hi> from his MS): We accept the emendation of the MS with
              confidence, not lessened by the Shakespearian alliteration thus afforded. The meaning
              is too plain to need explanation. [In his <hi rend="italic">Third Edition</hi>

                rend="italic">'feer'd,</hi> abbreviated from <hi rend="italic">affeer'd, i. e.,</hi>
              estimated at its true worth, appraised, <hi rend="italic">valued.</hi>&rsquo;
              [This suggestion would be almost conclusive, were it possible to find a single
              instance where <hi rend="italic">affeer</hi> is abbreviated to <hi rend="italic"
                >'feer,</hi> or where even any of the word's modifications is so abbreviated. Not an
              instance is to be found, I think, in the <hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi> nor in <hi
                rend="smallcap">Wright's</hi>
              <hi rend="italic">English Dialect Dictionary,</hi> where such an abbreviation could
              not fail to be given, if it had been ever used in any English dialect. C&aelig;sar
              is in a bitter mood. To his vexation over Anthony's misdoings is now added the
              mortifying news that those whose love for him had changed to fear were flocking to
              Pompey. Whereupon he begins to moralize and says that he ought to have known that this
              would be so, because from time immemorial he who is in power was loved up to the very
              moment when he attained that power. Then he became feared and people deserted him
              (just as they had deserted him for Pompey). Next, through this desertion, he becomes
              an ebb'd man. And this ebb'd man (again a victim of popular caprice, and now loved
              when all his power is gone and there is no longer profit in loving him), by being
              missed and wanted again by the people, comes again to be feared. Thus the common

              one of his tributaries. <hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi> (ed. ii): Knight prints
              &lsquo;vassals,&rsquo; though the rest of the speech so distinctly shows that

                <hi rend="italic">v</hi> for <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> C&aelig;sar has
              previously accused Antony of &lsquo;tippling with a slave,&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;reeling the streets at noon,&rsquo; which countenances <hi

              that &lsquo;vassailes&rsquo; is amended to <hi rend="italic">wassails</hi> in

              &lsquo;vassal&rsquo; or &lsquo;vassals&rsquo; occurs twenty times
              elsewhere in Shakespeare, which added to the present instance make twenty-one; of this
              number three occur in the present play; in a third of the instances it is spelt in the
              Folio <hi rend="italic">vassaile</hi> or <hi rend="italic">vassailes;</hi> it is also
              so spelt in <hi rend="italic">Sonnet 58.</hi> In none of these instances, except in
              the present, has there been any suggestion of <hi rend="italic">wassail;</hi> nor can
              I see any necessity for such a suggestion here, in spite of the dogmatic assertion of
              Dyce, whose note, to my regret, I do not comprehend. It is really not clear to me that
              Anthony ought to leave his revelry in Egypt, because &lsquo;the rest of the speech
              so distinctly shows&rsquo; that some time previously, at Modena, he drank gilded
              puddles and browsed on bark. The adjective which qualifies
              &lsquo;vassailes,&rsquo; seems to me to be far more appropriate to humankind
              than to drinking bouts. In the present play, it is spelt
              &lsquo;vassaile,&rsquo; II, vi, 71, and &lsquo;vassal,&rsquo; V, ii,
              35. It is to be borne in mind that the spelling of the compositors of the Folio is so
              lawless, that any appeal to its uniformity is generally useless.&mdash;<hi

                <hi rend="smallcap">Edwards</hi> (p. 131, where he proposes, independently, the same
              meaning as Seward): </p>
            <p>Mr Warburton here seems to have stolen Don Quixote's Rosinante, to mount the
              demiAtlas of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> earth. . . . However, he seems to have
              matched him well, with one from Fairfax who is <hi rend="italic">stall-worn. . .
              .</hi> But Mr Warburton, who made this match, has played us a Yorkshire trick; and the
              odds are prodigiously on old Fairfax's side; for when I come to look upon him in his
              stable, he is really not a <hi rend="italic">stall-worn,</hi> but a <hi rend="italic"
                >stalworth</hi> steed; now <hi rend="italic">stalworth</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                >stalwart,</hi> signifies <hi rend="italic">bold, courageous, strong.</hi>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Heath</hi> (p. 452): &lsquo;Arm-gaunt&rsquo; is in my
              apprehension, a steed whose armour fitted him, and set close about him. <hi
                rend="smallcap">Johnson</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Arm</hi> is the Teutonick word for
                <hi rend="italic">want,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">poverty.</hi>
              &lsquo;Arm-gaunt&rsquo; may be therefore an old word, signifying <hi
                rend="italic">lean</hi> for <hi rend="italic">want,</hi> ill fed. Edwards's
              observation, that a worn-out horse is not proper for Atlas to mount in battle, is
              impertinent; the horse here mentioned seems to be a post-horse, rather than a
              war-horse. Yet as &lsquo;arm-gaunt&rsquo; seems not intended to imply any
              defect, it perhaps means, a horse so slender that a man might clasp him, and therefore
              formed for expedition. <hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: On this passage, which I
              believe to be corrupt, I have nothing satisfactory to propose. It is clear that
              whatever epithet was used, it was intended as descriptive of a beautiful horse, such
              (we may presume) as our author has described in his Venus and Adonis. <hi
                rend="smallcap">M. Mason</hi>: I should amend by reading: &lsquo;a <hi
                rend="italic">termagant</hi> steed, <hi rend="italic">That</hi> neigh'd,&rsquo;
              etc. <hi rend="italic">Termagant</hi> means <hi rend="italic">furious.</hi> So
              Douglas, in <hi rend="italic">Henry IV.</hi> is called the <hi rend="italic"
              >termagant</hi> Scot, an epithet that agrees well with the steed's neighing so high.
              Besides, by saying that Antony mounted composedly a horse of such mettle, Alexas
              presents Cleopatra with a flattering image of her hero, which his mounting slowly a
              jaded post-horse, would not have done. <hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: When I first
              met with Mason's conjecture, I own I was startled at his boldness; but that I have
              since been reconciled to it, its appearance in the present text of Shakspeare will
              sufficiently prove. The sobriety displayed by Antony in mounting a steed of temper so
              opposite, reminds us of a similar contrast in Addison's celebrated comparison of the
              Angel: &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Calm</hi> and <hi rend="italic">serene</hi> he
              drives the furious blast.&rsquo; <hi rend="smallcap">Boswell</hi>: May I be
              permitted to throw out a conjecture, as to which I myself have no great confidence.
                <hi rend="italic">Gaunt</hi> is certainly <hi rend="italic">thin;</hi> but as it is
              generally used in speaking of animals made <hi rend="italic">savage by hunger,</hi>
              such as a <hi rend="italic">gaunt</hi> wolf, a <hi rend="italic">gaunt</hi> mastiff,
              it is possible that it may derivatively have acquired the sense of fierce, and an <hi
                rend="italic">arm-gaunt</hi> steed may signify a steed looking fierce in armour. <hi
                rend="smallcap">Nares</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Gloss. s. v.</hi>): It seems to me
              that Warburton though he failed in his proof, gave the interpretation best suited to
              the text, <hi rend="italic">worn by military service.</hi> This implies the military
              activity of the master; all the rest of the senses are reproachful, and are therefore
              inconsistent with the speech which is made to display the gallantry of a lover to his
              mistress. <hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Notes,</hi> p. 151) quotes
              Nares with approval, and adds that he has not the slightest doubt that Collier's MS
              and Hanmer were right in their &lsquo;arm-<hi rend="italic">girt.</hi>&rsquo;
                <hi rend="smallcap">Knight</hi>: &lsquo;Arm-gaunt&rsquo; conveys the notion
              of a steed fierce and terrible in armour; and the epithet therefore is not to be
              lightly replaced by any other. <hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> (ed. i):
              &lsquo;That is, a horse which had perhaps become gaunt by bearing arms. However
              this is doubtful.&rsquo; <hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> in his <hi rend="italic"
                >Second Edition</hi> adopted the change of his MS, <hi rend="italic">arm-girt,</hi>
              &lsquo;which accords with Hanmer's suggestion: <hi rend="italic">arm-girt</hi> is,
              of course, girded with armour.&rsquo; In his <hi rend="italic">Third Edition,</hi>
              he discarded <hi rend="italic">arm-girt</hi> and returned to
              &lsquo;arm-gaunt&rsquo; which, he says, &lsquo;is very intelligible, and
              not less forcible.&rsquo; W. N. L[<hi rend="smallcap">ettsom</hi>?] (<hi
                rend="italic">N. &amp; Qu.</hi> I, vii, 378, 1853): This appears to me a mere

              supposition that the phrase originally stood <hi rend="italic">on a rampaunt,</hi>
              furnishes an imaginary genealogy of the word as we now have it, thus:&mdash;<hi

              <hi rend="smallcap">Singer</hi>: The epithet, <hi rend="italic">arrogant</hi> [adopted
              in Singer's text], is the happy suggestion of Mr Boaden, and is to be preferred, both
              on account of its more striking propriety and because it admits of the original
              article, &lsquo;an&rsquo; retaining its place before it. <hi rend="smallcap"

              the propriety of &lsquo;sallad,&rsquo; and calculates the age of Cleopatra,

              that, &lsquo;If an &AElig;gyptian could at those years have reason to complain
              of coldness of blood, she must have a very particular constitution.&rsquo; But he
              concludes by upholding Shakespeare, who found his authority in Plutarch's report that
              Cleopatra was &lsquo;but a young thing&rsquo; when she knew C&aelig;sar
              and Pompey, and that she fell in love with Anthony in the prime of her beauty. (See

              inflicts what it is difficult to regard as other than an injury to the text, by giving
              what he calls, &lsquo;Shakespear's best justification&rsquo; in
              &lsquo;restoring his own sense, which is done merely by a different
              pointing:&mdash;&ldquo;My sallad days: When I was green in judgment. Cold in
              blood! To say as I said then.&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">Cold in blood,</hi> is an

                as cold as my judgment, if you have the same opinion of things now as I had
              then.</hi>&rsquo; This punctuation, and interpretation have been substantially
              followed down to this very hour. <hi rend="smallcap">Boswell</hi> remarks that
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">cold</hi> and <hi rend="italic">green</hi> seem to be
              suggested by the metaphor <hi rend="italic">sallad</hi> days.&rsquo; Wherein he is
              right; what he should have added is that both apply, not to Charmian, but to
              Cleopatra. What to her was the temperature of Charmian's blood? The coldness had been
              her own, and she was finding excuses for having &lsquo;ever loved C&aelig;sar
              so.&rsquo; If those were her sallad days they were as inevitably both green and
              cold. The abruptness of the phrase, &lsquo;To say, as I said then!&rsquo;
              intensifies its scorn. It is parallel to her reply in a previous scene,
              &lsquo;Thou teachest like a fool! The way to lose him!&rsquo; and in a

              know not why Menecrates appears; Menas can do all without him. [In the following note,
              Capell endeavours to prove that a judicious discrimination will distinguish Menas from
              Menecrates; that &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Mene,</hi>&rsquo; in line 5, should
              be <hi rend="italic">Menas;</hi> and that, furthermore, Warburton's emendation, <hi

                rend="smallcap">Capell</hi> (i, 31): All the speeches in this scene, except one by
              Varrius, are given by the Folios to Pompey and Menecrates only; this was such a
              palpable error with respect to one of them [line 49] that it stands corrected in all
              the moderns, and of that speech <hi rend="italic">Menas</hi> is made the speaker, and
              so he <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be of [that in line 5]. A little reflection upon
              the characters of the parties in question, will set the whole of this scene in the
              clearest light; and shew, withal, the propriety of both these corrections [namely, <hi
                rend="italic">Menas</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Mene.</hi> in line 5, and Warburton's
                <hi rend="italic">delay's</hi>]: The character of Pompey is mark'd by&mdash;a
              high sense of honour; and by a natural honesty, join'd with irresolution and a
              backwardness to engage in great actions: that of Menas has nothing particular, but
              that he is Pompey's fast friend: Menecrates is also his friend; but not in favour,
              like Menas, from being discontented, and disapproving his patron's conduct: Thus
              stated, the characters themselves will point out who the speeches belong to: he who
              speaks in the second agrees with Pompey, in thinking&mdash;that the gods would
              befriend them at last; but, delivering his opinion in the form of a maxim,
              &lsquo;what they do delay, they not deny,&rsquo; the other takes occasion from
              one of those words to tell him&mdash;that there was a delay which he should make
              his chief petition to heaven, meaning&mdash;a delay of the preparations against
              him: this is taken up by Menecrates, whose dissent is worded also in maxims, a
              respectful way of expressing dissent; intimating by them,&mdash;that his opinion
              was rather, that Pompey himself should prepare, and attack the triumvirs before their
              whole strength was gather'd together: and this speech of Menecrates is a most
              unanswerable argument in favour of the latter amendment [<hi rend="italic"
              >delay's</hi>], and no small one in that of the first [<hi rend="italic">Menas</hi>
              for <hi rend="italic">Mene.</hi>]; for, unless <hi rend="italic">delay's</hi> be
              admitted, no reason can be assign'd for making the reflections contain'd in it; and,
              if he be the maker of them, he could not be so of that in the other speech, their
              tendencies being so contrary. <hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: I have given the first
              two speeches to Menecrates, and the rest to Menas. It is a matter of little
              consequence. [For Johnson's suggestion that this Scene might be included in the First

              delay.&rsquo; The other turns his words to a different meaning, and replies,

              avarice at Rome; and Lepidus employed in keeping well with both. [This emendation of
              Warburton would have been relegated to the <hi rend="italic">Text. Notes,</hi> had it
              not beguiled as sensible an editor as Capell.] <hi rend="smallcap">Heath</hi>: (p.
              453): This emendation of Mr Warburton's is certainly nonsense, whatever becomes of the
              common text which he is pleased to call so. Who ever prayed for success in any
              enterprize, and at the same time prayed that that success might be delayed as long as
              he should pray for it? Besides the reply of Menecrates plainly implies that delay was
              not the thing sued for; but something else which was for the present denied; which
              could not be delay, since Pompey was already in possession of that, but must be the
              attainment of the empire. The ancient reading is undoubtedly the true one. The sense
              is, While we are wearying the Gods with prayers, the very thing we are praying for,
              that is the empire, is falling into decay and ruin by the ill conduct of my
              competitors, by the luxurious indolence of Antony, the avaricious extortions of
              C&aelig;sar, and by the insincerity and private views of all the three triumvirs.

              later allusion to this conjecture, it is to be inferred that he withdrew it. <hi

                >wanned,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">made wan,</hi> a participle. So, in <hi

                rend="italic">waned</hi> lip, <hi rend="italic">i. e. decreased,</hi> like the moon,
              in its beauty. Yet this expression of Pompey's, perhaps, after all, implies a wish
              only, that every charm of love may confer additional softness on the lips of
              Cleopatra: <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> that her beauty may improve to the ruin of her
              lover; or, as Ritson expresses the same idea, that &lsquo;her <hi rend="italic"

              days.&rsquo; The epithet <hi rend="italic">wan</hi> might indeed have been added,
              only to show the speaker's private contempt of it. <hi rend="smallcap">Percy</hi>:

              declined, gone off from its perfection; comparing Cleopatra's beauty to the moon past

              such a wild fancy would spring up spontaneously in the brains of two commentators. Not

              physiology; there are, I believe, no pigmentary cells in the lips which can be

              &lsquo;wand&rsquo; is &lsquo;evidently the past participle of the verb <hi

              this interpretation is not lacking in fitness. Cleopatra's lips, at the age of

              show&rsquo; as the lips of Helena, &lsquo;those kissing cherries&rsquo; as
              Demetrius calls them; and it is to be remembered that it is not an admirer of
              Cleopatra that terms her lips wan. To Anthony, one kiss from them, wan'd or not,
              &lsquo;repaid all that he had lost.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

                rend="italic">flood</hi> of feasts&rsquo; seems almost equally objectionable,
              though intelligible; however, if any part of this play, as published, were derived
              from shorthand notes, &lsquo;field&rsquo; and <hi rend="italic">flood</hi>
              would be spelt with the same letters, and hence possibly the confusion. W. W[<hi
                rend="smallcap">illiams</hi>] (<hi rend="italic">Parthenon,</hi> 17 May, 1862):
              Assuredly, Shakespeare has no metaphor similar [to &lsquo;field of
              feasts&rsquo;] throughout his works. &lsquo;Field&rsquo; is defined by
              Johnson as being strictly &lsquo;ground not inclosed, the open country;&rsquo;
              and to &lsquo;tie,&rsquo; he tells us, is &lsquo;to constrain or confine,
                <hi rend="italic">up</hi> being little more than an emphatical addition.&rsquo;
              Pompey, wishing to fasten Antony to a particular spot, would scarcely desire the
              security of an <hi rend="italic">open</hi> space. But there is a word, for which, by a
              very probable misreading, &lsquo;field&rsquo; may have been substituted. <hi
                rend="italic">Fold,</hi> says Johnson, is an &lsquo;enclosure of any
              kind,&rsquo; and a fold would therefore exactly suit Pompey's purpose. The most
              rigid foliantist cannot object to weigh for a moment whether the true meaning may not
              be,&mdash;&lsquo;Tie up the libertine in a <hi rend="italic">fold</hi> of
              feasts.&rsquo; We have then a figure of which Shakespeare is particularly fond. .
              . . A reference to a <hi rend="italic">Concordance</hi> will save me any parade of
              confirmatory passages. [The phrase is certainly obscure, and yet I venture to think
              that the Folio needs no alteration. Pompey's train of thought is, let me imagine,
              somewhat as follows: At all hazards, Anthony must be kept in Egypt, a prisoner to his
              passions; within this boundary the libertine must be tied up. But the very idea of a
              libertine involves a certain freedom of motion; a libertine cannot be tied up to a
              single feast, else he would cease to be a libertine in feasts; there must be many
              feasts; in using the word &lsquo;libertine&rsquo; there may have then crept
              into Shakespeare's mind that charming simile which elsewhere he twice uses, whereby
              the air becomes a &lsquo;chartered libertine,&rsquo; blowing wheresoever it
              pleases, over hill and dale, and a single feast hereby expands, in imagination, into a
              whole field of feasts. Some limitations there must be; what better than a field of
              vague extent, wherein a libertine could be confined and indulge in endless feasting,
              day and night. </p>

              barbarous pronunciation must be adopted. Apparently, warming with his subject, he goes
              from bad to worse until, toward the close, he recommends such words as <hi
                rend="italic">hostil'ty, virgin'ty, pur'ty</hi> and &lsquo;suspects that the

              (p. 11): Modern editors have taken great liberties with the Folio punctuation of this
              speech, in total disregard of the point on which Pompey is enlarging, viz., that
              Anthony's accession to the side of C&aelig;sar and Lepidus will, if it prove to be
              a fact, indicate the strength of Pompey's menace. As usually punctuated the speech is
              self-contradictory, for Pompey is thereby made to say first that he knows not how it
              is, then to explain how it is, and finally to reassert that he knows not how it is. On
              the other hand, according to the Folio punctuation, Pompey states the only possible
              ground that occurs to him for Anthony's reported movements; he would rather expect
              Anthony to remain on quarrelsome terms with his colleagues of the Triumvirate; he
              therefore awaits confirmation of the report, holding it, if true, as a proof of his
              power and, at the same time, of the necessity of using that power to the uttermost
              against such a combination. </p>

              [There is, possibly, one interpretation which may justify the text as it stands.
              C&aelig;sar has just insinuated that Anthony while still in Egypt
              &lsquo;practised&rsquo; against him, and is attempting to prove this, by what
              befell in Italy. His case would have been weak indeed, if he could assert merely that
              Anthony's wife and brother, in their war, had used Anthony's name as a pretext; in
              such circumstances, Anthony himself might be as innocent as the babe unborn. To prove
              Anthony guilty, therefore, C&aelig;sar must connect him, personally, with this
              &lsquo;contestation.&rsquo; He asserts, therefore, that this very contestation
              was cause enough, in itself, for Anthony's practises&mdash;the mere fact that it
              existed was sufficient matter for Anthony to work on, or as it stands, in the fewest
              possible words, in the text, &lsquo;their contestation was theme for
              you.&rsquo; Then, in order to involve them all, Fulvia, Lucius, and Anthony, in
              one common &lsquo;practise,&rsquo; C&aelig;sar adds, &lsquo;you were

              correct&mdash;if C&aelig;sar did wish to &lsquo;patch a

              matter could offer itself for the purpose than that which he is here expressly told he
              could not use. The wife and brother of Antony had made war upon C&aelig;sar.
              C&aelig;sar accuses Antony, although he was in Egypt, of having instigated them;
              of being, as he says, &lsquo;the word of war.&rsquo; Antony denies it; and,
              most likely, truly; but had C&aelig;sar wanted to make use of the facts, as far as
              they went, for the purpose of patching a quarrel with Antony, public opinion,
              notwithstanding Antony's denial, would perhaps have gone with C&aelig;sar; and
              though in itself, it might not have been a sufficient cause of quarrel, yet with the
              addition of a few other grievances, it might have been made to constitute one. Still,
              it would have borne the appearance, as Antony </p>
            <p>says, of a patched quarrel, and not as made out of whole matter.&mdash;<hi

              says, &lsquo;refers to former letters, and C&aelig;sar to former excuses; so
              that when Antony speaks of <hi rend="italic">patching the quarrel,</hi> he means that
              the quarrel has been already <hi rend="italic">worn out</hi> by discussion.
              C&aelig;sar ought (he says) to be able to adduce a new and entire ground of
              complaint; but that if he will patch up the old quarrel he must do it with something
              else than the pretence that Antony's wife and brother have made wars upon
              him.&rsquo; Ingleby concludes somewhat in Warburtonian style: &lsquo;This
              conclusive interpretation of the text was proposed to me by Prof. Sylvester, the
              world-renowned mathematician. After this, an editor who shall reprint the text with
              Rowe's emendation will only have the excuse of ignorance.&rsquo; &mdash;<hi

              anonymous writer is; he is also, apparently, unknown to the Cambridge
                Editors.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">The Cowden-Clarkes</hi> (following the text):
              That is, if you wish to botch up a quarrel, as you have whole and sound matter to make
              it good with, you must not use such flimsy stuff as this. We think that the
              phraseology is purposely equivocal here: Antony allowing C&aelig;sar to understand
              either &lsquo;If you desire to pick a quarrel with me, you could find stronger
              ground to base it upon than these frivolous causes of complaint,&rsquo; or
              &lsquo;If you wish to make up the quarrel between us, you have better means of
              doing so than by ripping up these trivial grievances.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Irving Edition</hi> finds Cowden-Clarke's suggestion that the
              phraseology is equivocal, &lsquo;a forced interpretation. The meaning appears
              rather to be the reverse: make trivial things&mdash;mere bits and <hi
                rend="italic">patches,</hi> as it were&mdash;the ground of quarrel. These slight
              occasions for disagreement are opposed to <hi rend="italic">matter whole,</hi> or some
              serious cause for dissension.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Rolfe</hi>: A

              seem to be made all of a piece.&rsquo; [To me the meaning seems to be, If you'll
              patch a quarrel, inasmuch as you must make the patch out of good whole material, you
              must not take this. I think Ingleby is entirely right in his

              is a tender point, and touches my character nearly. Let him therefore urge his charge,

              think that either Johnson's or Malone's explanation of this passage is satisfactory.

              a breach of honour in denying to send him aid when he required it, which was contrary
              to his oath. Antony says, in his defence, that he did not deny his aid, but, in the
              midst of dissipation, neglected to send it: that having now brought his forces to join
              him against Pompey, he had redeemed that error; and that therefore the honour which
              C&aelig;sar talked of, was <hi rend="italic">now</hi>

            <p>sacred and inviolate, supposing that he had been somewhat deficient before, in the

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Johnson</hi>: This line is passed by all the editors, as if they
              understood it, and believed it universally intelligible. I cannot find in it any very
              obvious, and hardly any possible meaning. I would therefore read: &lsquo;Go to
              then, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> considerate <hi rend="italic">ones.</hi>&rsquo;
              You who dislike my frankness and temerity of speech, and are so <hi rend="italic"
                >considerate</hi> and discreet, <hi rend="italic">go to,</hi> do your own
                business.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Capell</hi> (i, 33), in this instance keener
              than Dr Johnson, gives the meaning of Enobarbus as that &lsquo;he would, from
              thenceforth, be a very stone for silence, but he would think a
                little.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: That is, if I must
              be chidden, henceforward I will be as mute as a marble statue, which seems to think,
              though it can say nothing. &lsquo;As silent as a stone,&rsquo; however, might
              have been once a common phrase.&mdash;[Hereupon follow several examples which
              might be multiplied, drawn from old sources where a stone is used as a simile of
              silence or stillness.]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Blackstone</hi>: The metre of
              this line is deficient. It will be perfect, and the sense rather clearer, if we read
              (without altering a letter): &lsquo;&mdash;your consideratest one.&rsquo;
              I doubt, indeed, whether this adjective is ever used in the superlative degree; but in
              the mouth of Enobarbus it might be pardoned.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap"
              >Ritson</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Cursory Crit.</hi> 85): As Enobarbus, to whom this
              line belongs, generally speaks in plain prose, there is no occasion for any further
              attempt to harmonize it.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> (ed. i): It may
              be a question whether Enobarbus means to call Antony &lsquo;a considerate
              stone,&rsquo; or to say merely that he will be silent as a stone. If the former,
              we must, with Johnson, change &lsquo;your&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic"
              >you;</hi> but the latter affords a clear meaning without any alteration of the
              ancient text.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Remarks,</hi>
              246): Enobarbus call Antony a <hi rend="italic">stone!</hi> he would as soon have
              ventured to throw one at him. Johnson's proposed alteration, bad as it certainly was,
              did not involve such an absurdity. &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> (ed.
              ii): That is, I will be as considerate as a stone. Johnson's notion [where?] that
              Enobarbus meant to call Antony a &lsquo;considerate stone,&rsquo; does not
              seem to us, recollecting that the words were those of a rough free-spoken soldier,
              such an &lsquo;absurdity&rsquo; as it appeared to the Rev. Mr Dyce. In
              speaking of the note in our first edition, he ought to have remembered two things,
              which he has entirely overlooked, viz., that we gave the very text he supports, and
              that we ourselves said no change was needed. If Mr Dyce had been more of a
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">considerate</hi> stone,&rsquo; he would have saved
              himself from the appearance of endeavouring to make a fault where he could not find
              one. We do not at all say that the suspicion would be just, but that he has laid
              himself open to it.&mdash;[Whoever wishes to hear the last word in this deplorable
              quarrel between two men who had been for many years fast friends, will find it in
              Dyce's <hi rend="italic">Strictures,</hi> p. 203, where he exultantly proves that to
              Collier exclusively belongs the notion that Enobarbus called Antony a stone! Time did
              not abate the flush of Dyce's triumph. Seven years later he repeated these remarks in
              his <hi rend="italic">Strictures</hi> at full length, in his <hi rend="italic">Second
                Edition.</hi> Apparently, so far from being crushed under this appalling stigma of
              bad pree&lt;*&gt;minence, Collier in his <hi rend="italic">Monovolume</hi>
              placidly printed &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">you</hi> considerate stone,&rsquo;
              and in his <hi rend="italic">Third Edition,</hi> while returning to the old text,
              reprinted the substance of the note in his <hi rend="italic">First
              Edition.</hi>]&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Staunton</hi>: <hi rend="italic">As
                silent as</hi>
            </p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">a stone</hi> was an expression not unusual formerly, and the words
              in the text may hereafter be found to be proverbial; at present they are
                inexplicable.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi>: Meaning, apparently, <hi
                rend="italic">I am</hi> your considerate stone; like a statue, which seems to speak,
              but does not.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Elze</hi> (p. 285) is, apparently, willing
              to be pilloried alongside of Collier, and suggests, although &lsquo;with
              hesitation,&rsquo; &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">you're</hi> considerate
              stone,&rsquo; that is: &lsquo;You are indeed considerate ( =discreet,
              circumspect), but at the same time &ldquo;senseless as a stone,&rdquo;
              inaccessible to conciliatory and tender emotions.&rsquo;&mdash;[Instead of
              saying as in modern parlance, &lsquo;All right. Your obedient servant,&rsquo;
              Enobarbus replies in effect, &lsquo;I understand. Your intelligent and
              accommodating stone,&rsquo; with all that a &lsquo;stone&rsquo; implies of
              dumbness, deafness, and impassivity. At least such is the interpretation of
              Enobarbus's words in the opinion of the present <hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              prevent the evil Enobarbus predicted. Besides are we to suppose that common civility
              would suffer him to take the same liberty with Antony's lieutenant, that Antony
              himself did? Shakespeare wrote &lsquo;I do not much dislike the <hi rend="italic"

                <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> 'tis not his liberty of speech, but the mischiefs he
              speaks of, which I dislike. This agrees with what follows, and is said with much
              urbanity, and show of friendship.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Heath</hi> (p. 454):
              That is, As to the matter of what he hath said, there is probably too much truth in
              it, though the want of respect in his manner of saying it may deserve blame. That this
              is the sense is most clearly evident from the confession of C&aelig;sar which
              immediately follows.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Capell</hi> (i, 33): Here is
              another transposition; the words &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">manner</hi>&rsquo;
              and &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">matter</hi>&rsquo;: the emendation was started by
              [Warburton], is confirm'd by what the speaker says afterwards, and recommended by much
              delicacy.&mdash;[The present play was the fifth that Capell printed (vol. i, p.
              19, <hi rend="italic">footnote</hi>). It is noteworthy how much in these early plays
              he was under the influence of Warburton. In the present instance, he preferred the
              speciousness of Warburton to the sound sense of Heath.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Ed.</hi>]&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Johnson</hi>: &lsquo;I do not (says
              C&aelig;sar), think the man wrong, but too free of his interposition; for it

              cannot be likely that C&aelig;sar would break in upon Agrippa's first words,
              especially if it were merely to tell him to continue speaking, a very needless

              for which he was immediately checked; but now, therefore, after the departure of his
              rigorous masters, he enters with more freedom into a conversation in prose with

              description of Antony's first meeting with Cleopatra, he resumes blank verse. The poet
              was well enough aware that only in blank verse could this majestic masterpiece be
              adequately portrayed, and, therefore, the humourous side of Enobarbus's character is

              heart on the river Cydnus; but it appears from the conclusion of his own description,
              that Antony had never seen her there; that, whilst she was on the river, Antony was
              sitting alone, enthroned in the market-place, whistling to the air, all the people
              having left him to gaze upon her: and that, when she landed, he sent to her to invite
              her to supper.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Cowden-Clarke</hi>: The inattention is
              Mason's, not Shakespeare's; the expression &lsquo;upon the river of
              Cydnus,&rsquo; is here used to signify &lsquo;the district on the shores of
              the river of Cydnus,&rsquo; including the &lsquo;city&rsquo; which
              &lsquo;cast her people out upon her,&rsquo; and its
              &lsquo;market-place&rsquo; wherein &lsquo;Antony&rsquo; sat
              &lsquo;enthroned.&rsquo; The idiom &lsquo;upon the Seine,&rsquo; or

              when in the sea-fight at Actium, he leaves the battle, and &lsquo;like a doating

              that it had been uttered by a more interesting personage. Dryden has transferred it to
              Antony,&mdash;copied it pretty closely,&mdash;or perhaps kept closer to
              Plutarch's prose. The poetry he almost suppresses; but he certainly introduces the
              story more artfully. Narration for its own sake is not, however, a frequent fault of

              think, would have so weakened by useless anticipation the fine image immediately
              following. The epithet &lsquo;seeming&rsquo; becomes so extremely improper
              after the whole number had been positively called &lsquo;so many
              mermaids.&rsquo; </p>
            <p>243, 244. <hi rend="bold">So many Mer-maides tended her i'th'eyes, And made their

              may be understood thus, her </p>
            <p>maids bowed with so good an air, that it added new graces to them. But this is not
              what Shakespeare would say; <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi> in this famous scene,
              personated <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi> just rising from the waves; at which time, the
              mythologists tell us, the Sea-deities surrounded the goddess to <hi rend="italic"
                >adore,</hi> and pay her homage. Agreeably to this fable Cleopatra had dressed her
              maids, the poet tells us, like Nereids. To make the whole conformable to the story
              represented, we may be assured Shakspeare wrote: &lsquo;And made their bends <hi
                rend="italic">adorings.</hi>&rsquo; They did her observance in the posture of
                <hi rend="italic">adoration,</hi> as if she had been Venus.&mdash;<hi

              expression as <hi rend="italic">adorings</hi> came from Shakespeare. The word, <hi
                rend="italic">bend,</hi> is here used for an arch, and the <hi rend="italic">bends
                of the eyes</hi> are the eye-brows. Thus the sense will be, That these seeming
              nereids were employed in adjusting Cleopatra's eye-brows, as often as they happened to
              be discomposed by the fanning of the boys, or any other accident. This interpretation
              is confirmed by the preceding words, <hi rend="italic">tended her in the

              paid her by the Deities of the Sea [as stated by Warburton], is by no means as
                certain.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Tollet</hi>: I think
              &lsquo;bends&rsquo; or <hi rend="italic">bands</hi> is the same word, and
              means, in this place, the several companies of Nereids, that waited on
              Cleopatra.&mdash; [Although I have no idea at what age Tollet died, it is to be
              regretted that he did not live long enough to withdraw this conjecture.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi> in the Var. of
              1778 apprehended that &lsquo;their bends&rsquo; refers to Cleopatra's eyes,
              and that &lsquo;her attendants watched the motion of her eyes, the <hi
                rend="italic">bends</hi> or movements of which added new lustre to her
              beauty.&rsquo; But he withdrew this interpretation in his edition of 1790, and
              gave in his adhesion to Warburton's <hi rend="italic">adorings.</hi> And in the Var.
              of 1821, he conceded that &lsquo;tended her i'the eyes&rsquo; &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">may</hi> only mean they performed their duty in the sight of their
                mistress.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Var.</hi> 1793): Perhaps &lsquo;tended her i'the eyes&rsquo; may signify
              that the attendants on Cleopatra looked observantly into her eyes, to catch her
              meaning, without giving her the trouble of verbal explanation. After all, I believe it
              only means waited before her, in her sight. So, in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> IV,
              iv, 5: &lsquo;If that his majesty would aught of us, We shall express our duty in
              his eye,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> in our personal attendance on him, by
              giving him ocular proof of our respect. Henley explains it thus: &lsquo;obeyed her
              looks without waiting for her words.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Monck
                Mason</hi>: The passage, as it stands, appears to me wholly unintelligible; but it
              may be amended by a very slight deviation from the text, by reading, <hi rend="italic"
                >the guise,</hi> instead of &lsquo;the eyes,&rsquo; and then it will run
              thus: &lsquo;Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides, So many mermaids, tended her i'
              the <hi rend="italic">guise,</hi> And made their bends, adornings.&rsquo;
              &lsquo;In the guise,&rsquo; means in the form of mermaids, who were supposed
              to have the head and body of a beautiful woman, concluding in a fish's tail: and by
              the bends <hi rend="italic">which they made adornings,</hi> Enobarbus means the
              flexure of the fictitious fishes' tails, in which the limbs of the women were
              necessarily involved, in order to carry on the deception, and which it seems they
              adapted with so much art as to make them an ornament, instead of a deformity. This
              conjecture is supported by the very </p>
            <p>next sentence, where Enobarbus, proceeding in his description, says: &lsquo;at
              the helm A seeming mermaid steers.&rsquo;&mdash;[This note of Mason with its
              harmless allusion to the &lsquo;flexure of the fictitious tails,&rsquo;
              afforded <hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi> too good an opportunity to be lost.
              Accordingly, after observing that Mason's conjecture, <hi rend="italic">guise,</hi>
              could not be thus used absolutely, without a limiting noun, he turns to the mermaids,
              who, &lsquo;whatever grace the tails of legitimate mermaids might boast of in
              their native element, must have produced but awkward effects when taken out of it, and
              exhibited on the deck of a galley. . . . I will undertake, in short, the expense of
              providing characteristic tails for any set of mimick Nereids, if my opponent will
              engage to teach them the exercise of these adscititious terminations, so as
              &ldquo;to render them a grace instead of a deformity.&rdquo; . . . It may be
              added also, that the Sirens and descendants of Nereus, are understood to have been
              complete and beautiful women, whose breed was uncrossed by the salmon or dolphin
              tribe.&rsquo; Finally, with the malicious smile still on his face, Steevens
              proposed to amend the phrase &lsquo;merely by the omission of a single letter, and
              read &ldquo;made their <hi rend="italic">ends</hi>
              adornings.&rdquo;&rsquo; Mason replied very temperately, like the Right
              Honourable gentleman that he was, in an <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi> to his <hi
                rend="italic">Comments on Beaumont and Fletcher,</hi> maintaining his ground and
              concluding with the assertion that he could &lsquo;find no sense in the passage
              as&rsquo; Steevens and Malone &lsquo;have printed it.&rsquo; The foregoing
              notes which I have condensed are &lsquo;so very long, as originally
              written,&rsquo; that in the <hi rend="italic">Variorum of 1821</hi> Boswell
              transferred them &lsquo;to the end of the play&rsquo;; there the student may
              read them at length; but, as in all such controversies, he will find but a ha'porth of
              Shakespeare to an intolerable deal of the disputants.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Ed.</hi>] <hi rend="smallcap">Z. Jackson</hi>, whose insufferable book was many
              years ago banned from these pages, must now be heard, inasmuch as his contribution to
              the discussion happens to be of value. He believes (p. 293) that
              &lsquo;bends&rsquo; is here used in a nautical sense (the
              &lsquo;bends&rsquo; are, according to Admiral <hi rend="smallcap">Smyth's</hi>
              <hi rend="italic">Sailor's WordBook,</hi> &lsquo;the thickest and strongest planks
              on the outward part of the ship's side, between the plank-streaks on which men set
              their feet in climbing up&rsquo;); the &lsquo;eyes&rsquo; also is nautical
              and means the &lsquo;dead eyes&rsquo; (a <hi rend="italic">dead-eye,</hi> also
              according to Admiral <hi rend="smallcap">Smyth</hi>, is &lsquo;a sort of round
              flattish wooden block, . . . pierced with three holes through the flat part, in order
              to receive a rope called a laniard, which, corresponding with three holes in another
              dead-eye on the shroud end, creates a purchase to extend the shrouds,
              etc.&rsquo;); &lsquo;on the <hi rend="italic">bends</hi> of Cleopatra's barge,
              therefore, stood her gentlewomen, uncovered to the waist,&rsquo; with an
              artificial mermaid's tail floating on the water. Thus Cleopatra's attendants,
              &lsquo;as so many mermaids, tended her i'the eyes (for there they held by the
              rigging, connected with the <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi>), and made the bends (whereon
              they stood) adornings, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> they adorned the <hi rend="italic"
                >bends,</hi> which otherwise would have remained devoid of ornaments.&rsquo;
              Accordingly, Jackson proposed to read:&mdash;&lsquo;And made <hi rend="italic"
                >the</hi> bends adornings.&rsquo; [Jackson is undoubtedly the earliest to apply
              a nautical interpretation to &lsquo;bends&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;eyes,&rsquo;&mdash;an interpretation to which the most recent
              criticism seems to be drifting. Unfortunately Jackson restricted
              &lsquo;eyes&rsquo; to the &lsquo;dead eyes.&rsquo;]&mdash;<hi

              we have the expression &lsquo;gambol in his eyes,&rsquo; for gambol in his
              sight; &lsquo;made their bends adornings&rsquo; is probably to be understood,
              that they bowed with so much grace as to add to their beauty. &mdash;[Zachary
              Jackson believed, as we have seen, that &lsquo;th'eyes&rsquo; refers to
              &lsquo;dead eyes,&rsquo; for the nautical use of which term there is good
              authority; in the following note </p>
            <p>&lsquo;th'eyes&rsquo; is supposed to refer to the hawse-holes,&mdash;a
              use for which, in Shakespeare's time, authority is thus far lacking. The note is much
              condensed and paraphrased, as indeed all the notes on this vexed question are, of
              necessity.]&mdash;C. F. B. (<hi rend="italic">Putnam's Maga.,</hi> March, 1857):
              In Webster's <hi rend="italic">Dict.</hi> under the article &lsquo;Eye&rsquo;
              there will be found a phrase &lsquo;the eyes of a ship,&rsquo; with the
              definition that they are &lsquo;the parts which lie near the
              hawse-holes.&rsquo; [&lsquo;The foremost part of the bows of a ship, where
              formerly eyes were painted; also the hawse holes.&rsquo;&mdash;Webster, <hi
                rend="italic">Dict.</hi> 1891.] It is a phrase in common use, at present, among
              mariners, when speaking of the interior bows of a vessel. Bearing in mind the
              foregoing definition, and also that &lsquo;tended&rsquo; may be an
              abbreviation of <hi rend="italic">attended,</hi> I think we shall find no difficulty
              in reading the passage as it now stands. If we follow Enobarbus's sketch we shall find
              that the size and interior arrangements of the barge were such as to allow no other
              space for &lsquo;her gentlewomen&rsquo; to occupy, and that they must be
              stationed in the bows. The pavilion was too small and the air too warm to admit any
              more than the &lsquo;dimpled boys&rsquo; on each side of Cleopatra and they
              were endeavouring to keep its fair owner cool. There can be no space for the majority
              of the gentlewomen near the pavilion, while, stationed in the bows, or <hi
                rend="italic">eyes</hi> of the barge, their various and ever-changing attitudes and
              movements (either while waiting on Cleopatra's commands or when gazing on the crowd
              that lined the shore) added to and improved the general effect of the scene, or
              &lsquo;made their bends adornings.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              an instance of the superfluous <hi rend="italic">s</hi> final, and that

              his <hi rend="italic">Second Edition,</hi> 1883, he still follows the Folio, and
              pronounces the phrase, &lsquo;incomprehensible;&rsquo; and adds, &lsquo;no

              &mdash;&lsquo;tended her in the <hi rend="italic">bends,</hi> And made their
              eyes adorings.&rsquo; It may count for something, though not much, in favour of
              the transposition we assume, that in <hi rend="italic">Pericles,</hi> II, iv, we

              &lsquo;eyes&rsquo; and &lsquo;bends&rsquo; were parts of Cleopatra's

              North has it: &lsquo;others tending the tackle and ropes of the barge;&rsquo;
              which settles the question as to the meaning of <hi rend="italic">eyes;</hi> and that
              once fixed, the other part of the interpretation is inevitable. What could the hardy
              soldier, Enobarbus, care for the curves of the mermaid's bodies? To us it is obvious

              barge,&mdash;the bows; near the hawseholes or eyes, through which the anchor
              chains passed,&mdash;and not Cleopatra's eyes; while on the other hand, North's
              allusion to the Graces makes it certain that &lsquo;their bends&rsquo; is the
              curves of the ladies' bodies, and not the bends or prominent streaks,&mdash;<hi

                <hi rend="smallcap">T. A. Trollope</hi> (1891, VII, xi, 82) came to the rescue,
              declaring that he considered the emendation &lsquo;peculiarly and strikingly
              happy,&rsquo; and furthermore &lsquo;humbly submitted&rsquo; that
              &lsquo;tended her i'the eyes&rsquo; is &lsquo;sheer nonsense.&rsquo;
              In the same volume (p. 182) <hi rend="smallcap">H. Ingleby, Br. Nicholson</hi>, and
                <hi rend="smallcap">R. M. Spence</hi>, all horrorstruck at the stigma of
              &lsquo;sheer nonsense,&rsquo; pleaded for the original text, with here and
              there a withering sneer at the proposed emendation. On p. 363, <hi rend="smallcap"
                >Trollope</hi> replied in a long communication (adhering inflexibly to his original
              opinion), written so brilliantly throughout and with such good-humoured benignity that
              his opponents must have been glad, I should think, that they had been the means of
              eliciting it. Of course their own opinions were not a whit changed by it. He who can
              acknowledge that he is convicted of an error is unfit to enter into a discussion; e'en
              though vanquished he must argue still. And so, in vol. xii (of the same Series), p.
              62, <hi rend="smallcap">H. Ingleby</hi> rejoined; <hi rend="smallcap">J. E.

              either the curves of the eyelids, or every motion to which her eyes were
              &ldquo;bent&rdquo;) had been made adornings.&rsquo; The <hi

              down his warder with the remark that &lsquo;he ventured to think this passage has
              received a full share of attention,&rsquo; whereto I think every one will agree.
              The discussion had lasted from the 22nd of November, 1890 to the 3rd of October, 1891
              and I think every one of the disputants would have been supposed upon a book that he
              ended precisely where he began. During its course, however, but not in connection with
              it, <hi rend="smallcap">W. W. Lloyd</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> VII, xii, 4)
              proposed the emendation &lsquo;'tended her i'the eyes, And <hi rend="italic"
                >marked</hi> their bends, adoring.&rsquo; The discussion had a brief
              recrudescence in 1902, when <hi rend="smallcap">N. H. Prenter</hi> (IX, ix, 222)
              revived the idea that the &lsquo;eyes&rsquo; were the hawseholes, the
              &lsquo;bends&rsquo; were the sailors' <hi rend="italic">knots,</hi> etc. On p.
              342 of the same volume, <hi rend="smallcap">J. Marshall</hi> argued that the
              &lsquo;eyes&rsquo; were sailors' <hi rend="italic">loops,</hi> etc. In the
              meantime, while this discussion was going on, <hi rend="smallcap">Deighton</hi> gave
              his paraphrase of the original text:&mdash;&lsquo;the mermaids waited upon
              her, ever observant of her wishes as shown by her looks, and lent fresh beauty to the
              picture by the grace with which they paid their homage.&rsquo; <hi rend="smallcap"
                >H. Littledale</hi>, in his admirable edition of Dyce's <hi rend="italic"
              >Glossary,</hi> gives, as a definition of &lsquo;bends&rsquo; in the present
              passage, &lsquo;glances; their eyes turned towards h&lt;*&gt;r, and by
              their bright glances </p>
            <p>adorned her.&rsquo; The latest voice to be heard on the question, and one worthy
              of all respect, is that of <hi rend="smallcap">Rolfe</hi>, who says, &lsquo;The
              part of North's account which corresponds to &ldquo;made their bends
              adornings&rdquo; seems to be the statement that the gentlewomen were apparelled
              &ldquo;like the Graces,&rdquo; and this must suggest a reference to grace in
              their movements. I believe that in all that has been written on the passage, no one
              has called attention to the very close paraphrase of North which Shakespeare gives:
              &ldquo;Her ladies and <hi rend="italic">gentlewomen</hi> . . . were apparelled <hi
                rend="italic">like the</hi> nymphs <hi rend="italic">Nereids</hi> (which are the <hi
                rend="italic">mermaids</hi> of the waters) and&rdquo;&mdash;after getting so
              far we have only to seek a parallel for &ldquo;like the Graces;&rdquo; and may
              we not find it in &ldquo;made their bends adornings?&rdquo;&mdash;made
              their very obeisance, as they <hi rend="italic">tended her,</hi> like that of the
              Graces waiting on Venus.&rsquo; I doubt that there is any corruption in this
              passage. A paraphrase by <hi rend="smallcap">Rann</hi> has been reserved as a final
              word. To me it adequately expresses the meaning of the whole
              phrase:&mdash;&lsquo;Her gentlewomen took their orders from the motion of her
              eyes, which gave her the happy opportunity of adding, by her looks, new lustre to her
              beauty; and made their obeisance with the utmost imaginable
                grace.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              because it had been handled. It is my firm belief that the silken tackle actually

              conjecture, the true lection occurred to me on copying the passage from the history
              where this not very feminine exploit is narrated. There we are </p>
            <p>told that the all-conquering, unconquerable Queen, after hopping till breath seemed

              &lsquo;no need of change&rsquo; is the strongest possible reason for believing

              &sect; 168. The difference between <hi rend="italic">of</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                >from</hi> in Shakespeare's time was so very slight that occasionally it is almost
              impossible to catch the </p>
            <p>subtle meaning that divides them; in the final resort this meaning must depend on the
              verb. In the present phrase, for instance, we could here substitute <hi rend="italic"
                >from</hi> for &lsquo;of&rsquo; without at all modifying the meaning, until
              we come to the verb, &lsquo;beats,&rsquo; and then we perceive that
              &lsquo;he beats thee from that natural luck&rsquo; conveys a different meaning
              from &lsquo;he beats thee of that natural luck;&rsquo; as when Hermione says
                (<hi rend="italic">Wint. Tale,</hi> I, ii, 42), &lsquo;say this to him, He's
              beat from his best ward.&rsquo; These prepositions are not, therefore, here at
              least, interchangeable, however much they may seem so at first sight. Nevertheless
              there are cases where it does seem perfectly immaterial which one is used. Take,
              &lsquo;His cocks do win the battle still of mine (line 41, below). Would it not
              run equally well if the phrase were still <hi rend="italic">from</hi> mine? Prospero
              uses &lsquo;from&rsquo; after the verb &lsquo;to win,&rsquo; where he
              says (<hi rend="italic">Temp.</hi> I, ii, 455), &lsquo;hast put thyself Upon this
              island as a spy, to win it From me.&rsquo; This coalescence of these two
              prepositions has incited the grammarians to find some rule which may be a guide to
              their use. <hi rend="smallcap">Abbott</hi> (&sect; 166) says that &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">of</hi>&rsquo; is used for <hi rend="italic">from</hi> with verbs
              that signify, either literally or metaphorically, depriving, delivering,
              etc.&rsquo; <hi rend="smallcap">Franz</hi> (&sect; 356) is more specific, and
              enumerates a considerable number of verbs where one or the other may be used, such as,
                <hi rend="italic">discharge, deliver, rid</hi> (to <hi rend="italic">free</hi> and
              to <hi rend="italic">release,</hi> on the other hand, are used in Shakespeare only
              with <hi rend="italic">from</hi>), <hi rend="italic">cleanse, clear, purge, wash,
                have, get, receive, take, borrow, win, wrest, be, descend, come,</hi> moreover,
              after the adjectives <hi rend="italic">free, clear, secure.</hi>
              &lsquo;If,&rsquo; continues Franz, &lsquo;after these verbs, <hi
                rend="italic">of</hi> and <hi rend="italic">from</hi> occasionally occur when they
              do not seem to be absolutely the same, and it may be desirable to decide upon the

              be doubted whether quail-fighting was practised in Shakspeare's time; but when our

              C&aelig;sar's or Antony's quails, which he found in Plutarch, were trained to
              battle like game cocks in a <hi rend="italic">ring</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
              >circle.</hi> Quail combats were well known among the ancients, and especially at
              Athens. Julius Pollux relates that a circle was made in which the birds were placed,
              and he whose quail was driven out of this circle lost the stake, which was sometimes
              money, and occasionally the quails themselves. [Douce gives an engraving from a
              Chinese miniature which] represents some ladies engaged at this amusement, where the
              quails are actually <hi rend="italic">inhoop'd.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              is from North's Plutarch, but the &lsquo;inhoop'd&rsquo; is the addition of
              our poet. No trace of such a mode of fighting has been found except in Davies's <hi
                rend="italic">Epigram,</hi> quoted by Farmer. Yet R. Holmes, who gives a list of
              terms and customs used in cock-fighting, has no mention of <hi rend="italic"
              >hoops.</hi> See his <hi rend="italic">Acad. of Armory,</hi> B. ii, ch. 11. Nor is any
              trace of the hoops to be found in any book on cock-fighting. If this custom of
              fighting cocks within hoops could be thoroughly proved, it would also afford the best
              explanation of the phrase <hi rend="italic">cock-a-hoop;</hi> the cock perching on the

              the train of luxury and refinement. Suppose he had been so learned, and withal such a

              late, however, certain investigators have turned the tables, and instead of leaving
              the unlucky anachronism to support the Farmerian theory of Shakespeare's want of
              learning, or the more kindly modern belief that he wrote too impetuously to be bound
              by mere chronology and scientific facts, they find in it an argument against the
              Shakespearian authorship of the plays, since as one of them says: &lsquo;The human
              encyclopedia who wrote that sentence appears to have known,&mdash;what very few
              people know nowadays,&mdash;that the game of billiards is older than
              Cleopatra.&rsquo; It may be, as asserted, that a rudimentary game, in which ivory
              balls were punched with a stick into holes in a table, after the fashion of our modern
              &lsquo;tivoli&rsquo; or &lsquo;bagatelle,&rsquo; was really in vogue
              more than two thousand years ago, but it is very certain that Shakespeare never
              bothered his head about it. He simply followed his habit, and cribbed the idea from
              somebody else. In Chapman's <hi rend="italic">Blind Beggar of Alexandria,</hi>
              &AElig;giale says: &lsquo;Go, Aspasia, Send for some ladies to go play with
              you At chess, at billiards, and at other game.&rsquo; As Chapman's play was
              printed in 1598, ten years before <hi rend="italic">Ant. &amp; Cleo.</hi> was
              written, it is easy to see where Shakespeare got the idea that billiards was an
              Egyptian game, and a favourite pastime of <hi rend="italic">women.</hi> Whether George
              Chapman, whose classical learning enabled him to translate Homer, wrote from actual
              knowledge, or committed an anachronism, may be disputed; but the probabilities lean to
              the latter conjecture, for, in this same play, the hero flourishes a pistol, smokes
              tobacco, swears by &lsquo;God's wounds,&rsquo; and talks fair modern Spanish,

              at any rate, much anterior to the introduction of tobacco into Europe, whereas Ben

              writer continues, &lsquo;but no dramatic author, to produce a scenic effect, would
              shrink from such anachronisms, because they are not &ldquo;gross,&rdquo; not
              so &ldquo;gross&rdquo; as to be detected in an instant by a theatrical
              audience, which knows nothing whatever about the origin of cannon, clocks, and
              billiards. But all Shakespeare's contemporaries, even the most ignorant, knowing that
              tobacco had been introduced into the old world during their lives, would have derided
              the great dramatist had he represented Sir John Falstaff consoling himself at Dame
              Quickly's in the reign of Henry the Fourth, with a pipe of tobacco. . . . So a
              dramatist of our age could not speak of William the Conqueror travelling by an express
              train, or sending a message by the electric telegraph; the </p>
            <p>anachronism would be &ldquo;gross&rdquo;; it would come immediately within
              the cognizance of the audience, who know what is going on in their own generation,
              with some knowing what went on in the generation immediately preceding; and, thinking
              the mistake ridiculous, they would burst into an excessive merriment. . . . But the
              anachronism would not be discovered by anybody in his audience, if a dramatic author
              were to represent the Egyptian Pharaoh Cheops going in a pair of boots to witness the
              progress of the building of the Great Pyramid, or the Jews returning in hats and shoes
              from their Babylonish captivity. For where can the theatrical audience be found that
              knows anything about the history of boots, hats, and shoes, when it does not comprise,
              peradventure, one man possessing sound learning and extensive information?&rsquo;

              <hi rend="smallcap">Mrs Jameson</hi> (ii, 133): As illustrative of Cleopatra's
              disposition, perhaps the finest and most characteristic scene in the whole play is
              that in which the messenger arrives from Rome with the tidings of Antony's marriage </p>
            <p>with Octavia. She perceives at once with quickness that all is not well, and she
              hastens to anticipate the worst, that she may have the pleasure of being disappointed.
              Her impatience to know what she fears to learn, the vivacity with which she gradually
              works herself up into a state of excitement, and at length into fury, is wrought out
              with a force of truth which makes us recoil.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Stapfer</hi> (p. 402): In the scene between Cleopatra and the messenger who brings
              the tidings of Antony's marriage with Octavia, her fury and unreasonableness know no
              bounds. Harpagon, thumping Ma&icirc;tre Jacques, who, in obedience to his master's
              orders, tells him candidly what is said of him in the town; the Viceroy of Peru, in
              the &lsquo;P&eacute;richole&rsquo; of M&eacute;rim&eacute;e,
              banishing his secretary for a like service, are models of wisdom and coolness compared
              to Cleopatra. There is some shadow of excuse for their anger, as the account given
              them is not the mere simple announcement of a fact, but consists of a long preachment
              which the secretary and Ma&icirc;tre Jacques may have flavoured with a spice of
              malice of their own; but the unhappy messenger to Cleopatra is as guiltless of the
              message as if he had given it to her under cover, closed and sealed. To insult him,
              beat him, and threaten him with a dagger shows a capability of exercising the same
              frenzy upon inanimate objects, such as pieces of furniture, mirrors, and china. No
              man, however furious, vents his rage in so senseless a form as this, which would seem
              to belong peculiarly to the anger of women and children. But at the same time, we must
              notice how passion dignifies every movement and action; the impetuous torrent of her
              wrath makes what is immeasurably petty, mean, and ridiculous appear even grand. No one
              would ever feel inclined to laugh at this scene, in which what might have been the
              subject for a comedy is transformed by the violence and force of Cleopatra's love into
              tragic cries and outbursts.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> (ed. ii): In

              according to the tenor of your message . . . The universal previous punctuation of the

              declaration; and that &lsquo;that&rsquo; in the previous line is not the
              conjunction, but the definitive adjective. Cleopatra, in reply to the messenger's

              shows himself to be in sympathy by sticking to it so constantly.&mdash;<hi

              The meaning would be, &lsquo;O that Antony's knavish fault of getting married
              should cause thee&mdash;thee that art not married&mdash;to be treated as a

              speech other than impulsive from an infuriated woman, still less from a Cleopatra
              maddened by jealous rage; nor was Shakespeare so bad an imitator of nature as to make

              languishment, are portrayed with the most astonishing power, and truth, and skill in
              feminine nature. More wonderful still is the splendour and force of colouring which is
              shed over this extraordinary scene. The mere idea of an angry woman beating her menial
              presents something ridiculous or disgusting to the mind; in a queen or a tragedy
              heroine it is still more indecorous; yet this scene is as far as possible from the
              vulgar or the comic. Cleopatra seems privileged to &lsquo;touch the brink of all

            <p>This imperial termagant, this &lsquo;wrangling queen, whom every thing

              distribution of parts. In the next scene, line 9, the servant describes Lepidus,
              &lsquo;He cries out, &ldquo;no more,&rdquo; reconciles them to his
              entreaty, and himself to the drink,&rsquo; which justifies us in supposing that it

              here. Pompey's allusion to &lsquo;fine Egyptian cookery&rsquo; is unfortunate,
              especially when he speaks of it to Anthony who is just married to Octavia; but his
              next reference to Julius C&aelig;sar and his feasting is worse. Anthony tries to
              stop him by saying &lsquo;you've heard altogether too much.&rsquo; Thereupon
              Pompey blunders still further by asserting that he really did not mean anything bad,
              that he had fair meanings. &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; retorts Anthony, &lsquo;see
              that you put them in fair words.&rsquo; But Pompey's ill-timed references are not
              yet ended, &lsquo;bad is begun but worse remains behind,&rsquo;&mdash;he
              refers to Cleopatra's first loveaffair. Hereupon Enobarbus takes in the situation,
              and, instantly silencing Pompey, says aside to him, &lsquo;Hush, no more of
              that!&rsquo; adding &lsquo;you are quite right,&mdash;Apollodorus did
              so.&rsquo; &lsquo;What?&rsquo; asks the bewildered Pompey, who then
              recognizes Enobarbus. And thereafter the dialogue continues without obstruction.
              Anthony had evidently turned away abruptly; he does not speak again during the
                scene.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              of the most beautiful <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> scenes of Shakespeare is the
              [present] banquet scene. It contains no chief part of the action, and is essentially a
              situation scene, a thing not occurring frequently in the tragic part of the action in
              Shakespeare. But it receives a certain significance, because it is at the close of the
              Second Act, and also stands in a place demanding eminence, especially in this piece,
              in which the preceding political explanations make a variegated and animated picture
              very desirable. The abundance of little characterising traits which are united in this
              scene, their close condensation, above all, the technical arrangement, are admirable.
              The Scene is introduced by a short conversation among servants, as is frequently the
              case in Shakespeare, in order to provide for the setting of the tables and the
              arrangement of the furniture on the stage. The Scene itself is in three parts. The
              first part presents the haughty utterances of the reconciled Triumvirs and the
              pedantry of the drunken simpleton, Lepidus, to whom the servants have already
              referred; the second, in terrible contrast, is the secret interview of Pompey and
              Menas; the third, introduced by the bearing out of the drunken Lepidus, is the climax
              of the wild Bacchanalia and rampant drunkenness. The connecting of the three parts, as
              Menas draws Pompey aside, as Pompey again in the company of Lepidus, resuming,
              continues the carouse, is quite worthy of notice. Not a word in the whole Scene is
              without its use and significance; the poet perceives every moment the condition of the
              individual figures, and of the accessory persons; each takes hold of the action
              effectively; for the manager, as well as for the r&ocirc;les, the whole is adapted
              in a masterly way. From the first news of Antony across the Nile,&mdash;through
              which the image of Cleopatra is introduced even into this scene,&mdash; and the
              simple remark of Lepidus, &lsquo;You have strange serpents there,&rsquo;
              through which an impression is made on the mind of the hearer that prepares for
              Cleopatra's death by a serpent's sting, to the last words of Antony, &lsquo;Good;
              give me your hand, sir,&rsquo; in which the intoxicated man involuntarily
              recognizes the superiority of Augustus C&aelig;sar, and even to the following
              drunken speeches of Pompey and Enobarbus, everything is like fine chiseled work on a
              firmly articulated metal frame. A comparison of this scene with the close of the
              banquet act in <hi rend="italic">The Piccolomini</hi> is instructive.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Corson</hi> (p. 285): Of Pompey's entertainment, made by Shakespeare
              so dramatically important a scene in the Play, Plutarch simply says, &lsquo;and
              there&rsquo; (meaning on his galley) &lsquo;he welcomed them and made them
              great cheer.&rsquo; But Shakespeare, knowing that wine reveals as well as
              disguises, that <hi rend="italic">in vino est veritas,</hi> made this banquet the
              means of characterising and contrasting the Triumvirs, and the poor relic of republi</p>

              &lsquo;by their foible,&rsquo; adding, &lsquo;a servant's
              speech.&rsquo; [I find it, however, a little difficult to combine the two
              definitions into a coherent and applicable paraphrase of the whole sentence. Is it:
              they serve one another a trick by their foibles?&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

                >Shakespeariana,</hi> Feb. 1884, p. 122): The servant has said [in effect], they
              have made him drink not only his own wine, but a share of theirs also. And now as they
                <hi rend="italic">dispose of</hi> and <hi rend="italic">set before</hi> him, their
              full goblets to quaff, they pinch one another, or wink significantly, at the
              imposition they are practising on the good-natured reveler. And this harmonises with
              the context, &lsquo;he cries, &ldquo;No more;&rdquo; reconciles them to
              his entreaty, and himself to the drink.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not another drop,
              gentlemen, I beseech you; I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er
              out;&rsquo; to all of which they assent; and he forthwith proceeds to drain the
              cups, that raise &lsquo;the greater war between him and his discretion.&rsquo;
              I formerly thought we should read &lsquo;as they pinch one another <hi
                rend="italic">at the imposition.</hi> But the explanation I have given seems
                sufficient.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Thiselton</hi> (p. 15): In order to ply
              Lepidus sufficiently with liquor and at the same time keep sober themselves, his
              companions give him &lsquo;Almes drinke,&rsquo; thereby stinting themselves
              (&lsquo;pinch one another by the disposition&rsquo;). By this means, he has
              their shares as well as his own, and, being satisfied with such good measure, and,
              perhaps, feeling some awkwardness at drinking alone in company, he cries out
              &lsquo;No more,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>
              &lsquo;enough.&rsquo; They, having so far gained their object, comply, while
              he proceeds to drink the wine that has been so served to him. . . . The passage has
              been confused by . . . the assumption that &lsquo;reconciles&rsquo;
              necessarily imports the inferiority of the wine served to Lepidus, when it probably
              indicates a slight touch of conscience on his part at continuing to drink alone.
              &lsquo;One another&rsquo; is certainly used somewhat loosely for <hi
                rend="italic">themselves,</hi> but it must be borne in mind that it is a servant who
                speaks.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Deighton</hi>: This seems to mean, as they ply
              each other hard with the mischievous desire of seeing one another under the table,
              Lepidus, affecting to have had as much as he can carry, cries out
              &lsquo;enough;&rsquo; yet all the same, while getting them to accept his
              excuses, finds it possible to quiet his scruples against further indulgence; though
              perhaps &lsquo;'twere to consider too curiously to consider&rsquo; the
              servant's speech as having any very exact sense.&mdash;[If &lsquo;one
              another&rsquo; can be regarded as the same as <hi rend="italic">themselves,</hi>
              Thiselton's interpretation seems to be the most plausible. The excuse, first suggested
              by Schmidt, for any looseness of expression&mdash;that it is the servants who are
              speaking&mdash;is hardly applicable when we find them presently referring, as
              Rolfe and Deighton assume, to the &lsquo;Ptolomaic system of astronomy,&rsquo;
              and using a term of astrology. But still, letting that excuse pass for what it is
              worth, the idea that by disposing of an extra allowance to Lepidus they </p>
            <p>stinted one another, is at least a more dignified explanation than that of supposing
              that they pinched each other, or tipped one another the wink, over the success of
              their &lsquo;little game.&rsquo; Schmidt's paraphrase,
              &lsquo;foibles,&rsquo; which he probably derived from Capell without exactly
              comprehending it, is to me, whether in Schmidt or Capell,
                unintelligible.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Johnson</hi>: This speech seems to be mutilated; to supply the
              deficiencies is impossible, but perhaps the sense was originally approaching to this:
              &lsquo;To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in
              it,&rsquo; is a very ignominious state; &lsquo;great offices&rsquo;
              &lsquo;are the holes where eyes should be, which (if eyes be wanting), pitifully
              disaster the cheeks.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">M. Mason</hi>: The
              thought, though miserably expressed, appears to be this: That a man called into a high
              sphere, without being seen to move in it, is a sight as unseemly as the holes where
              the eyes should be, without the eyes to fill them.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Malone</hi>: I do not believe a single word has been omitted. The being called into
              a huge sphere, and not being seen to move in it, these two circumstances, says the
              speaker, resemble sockets in a face where eyes should be [but are not], which <hi
                rend="italic">empty</hi> sockets, or holes without eyes, pitifully disfigure the
              countenance. &lsquo;The sphere in which the eye moves&rsquo; is an expression
              which Shakespeare has often used. Thus, in his 119th <hi rend="italic">Sonnet:</hi>
              &lsquo;How have mine eyes out of their <hi rend="italic">spheres</hi> been
              fitted,&rsquo; etc. Again, in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet:</hi> &lsquo;Make thy
              two eyes, like stars, start from their <hi rend="italic"
              >spheres.</hi>&rsquo;&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Rolfe</hi> here finds in
              &lsquo;sphere&rsquo; an &lsquo;allusion to the old Ptolomaic astronomy,
              according to which the heavenly bodies were set in hollow crystal spheres, by the
              revolution of which they were carried round.&rsquo; And
              &lsquo;disaster,&rsquo; he observes, &lsquo;was an astrological term and
              is probably suggested here by the figure that precedes.&rsquo; [Both of these
              suggestions are, to me, somewhat doubtful. &lsquo;Sphere&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;disaster&rsquo; had been </p>
            <p>so long used, I think, in their figurative sense, as in the two quotations given by
              Malone, that all thought of their origin had been lost. Of course this does not apply
              to &lsquo;music of the spheres&rsquo; or &lsquo;discord in the
              spheres&rsquo; and the like. Moreover, it seems to me hardly Shakespearian to put
              such learned allusions into the mouths of servants. Deighton agrees, however, with
              Rolfe and quotes him with approval.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              which render Shakspere so entirely above, and so utterly unlike, other poets. Every
              line is a trait of character. Here we see the solemn,
              &lsquo;unmeritable&rsquo; Lepidus; the cautious C&aelig;sar; the dashing,
              clever, genial Antony. His eye dances; his whole visage &lsquo;doth cream and
              mantle;&rsquo; the corners of his mouth are drawn down, as he hoaxes Lepidus about
              the crocodile with the most admirable fooling. The revelry grows louder and louder,
              till &lsquo;the Egyptian bacchanals&rsquo; close the scene. Who can doubt that

              <hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Pyramis</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                >pyramid</hi> was in common use in our author's time. So, in Bishop Corbet's <hi
                rend="italic">Poems,</hi> 1647: &lsquo;Nor need the chancellor boast, whose <hi
                rend="italic">pyramis</hi> Above the host and altar reared is.&rsquo; From this
              word Shakspeare formed the English plural, <hi rend="italic">pyramises,</hi> to mark
              the indistinct pronunciation of a man nearly intoxicated, whose tongue is now
              beginning to &lsquo;split what it speaks.&rsquo;&mdash;[This suggestion of
              Malone, that the pronunciation &lsquo;pyramises&rsquo; indicates the fumes of
              wine, has been silently adopted by several commentators since his day. There is not
              the smallest objection to allowing Lepidus to reach the utmost limits of intoxication,
              but I do not see that in the present speech he has advanced as far as Malone would
              have him. First, he does not say &lsquo;pyramises;&rsquo; this plural form
              Capell unwarrantably puts in his mouth. He says &lsquo;pyramisis,&rsquo;
              which, if he shared Bishop Corbet's apparent belief that <hi rend="italic"
              >pyramis</hi> is an English singular, is no bad attempt to form a regular English
              plural; certainly not so bad as to say that his tongue splits what it speaks.
              Secondly, Shakespeare does not depend on bad spelling to add comicality to language.
              All spelling in his day was too lawless. This does not apply, of course, to dialectic
              words like &lsquo;chill&rsquo; for <hi rend="italic">I will,</hi> and the
              like. If Lepidus's tongue were too &lsquo;thick,&rsquo; in modern, not
              Shakespearian, speech, to pronounce <hi rend="italic">pyramides,</hi> how comes it
              that immediately afterward he pronounces without difficulty a word quite as hard:
              &lsquo;contradiction&rsquo;? Lastly, in the very speech in which
              C&aelig;sar says his &lsquo;own tongue splits,&rsquo; </p>
            <p>there is no word misspelt, unless it be <hi rend="italic">spleets</hi> itself, which
              is probably merely phonetic, and not a misspelling. See the regular plural,
              &lsquo;pyramides,&rsquo; in V, ii, 71.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]

              example of its use &lsquo;with the same signification in a well-known modern poem:
              &ldquo;L' Avare, not using half his store, Still grumbles that he has no more;

              question of any one giving such an order.&rsquo; They, therefore, adopt Steevens's

              leader to bid him cut the cable, and fall to the throats of the Triumvirs. A great

              beautiful persons,&mdash;men and women who lean to one another, and caress their
              dogs and hawks, while they listen to the music of stringed instruments. In Shakspere's

              words,&mdash;that there is here an allusion to a &lsquo;noted
              witticism&rsquo; made by Pompey on the present occasion. This witticism was
              founded on the fact that the splendid residence in Rome of Pompey's father, at that
              time in the possession of Anthony, was situated on the <hi rend="italic">Via
                Carin&aelig;</hi> (&lsquo;or Galley-street, as we might call it&rsquo;)
              where even the houses themselves were built to resemble galleys; when, therefore,
              Pompey said that he would entertain C&aelig;sar and Anthony on his galley, there
              was a witty double allusion to his galley and his house in
              &lsquo;Galley-street.&rsquo; As authorities, Theobald quoted Paterculus:
              &lsquo;Qui [<hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> Pompeius] haud absurde, cum in navi
              C&aelig;saremque et Antonium coena exciperet, dixit, in Carinis suis se coenam
              dare; referens hoc dictum ad loci nomen, in quo paterna domus ab Antonio
              possidebatur.&rsquo;&mdash;[lib. ii, cap. lxxvii.] And also Aurelius Victor:
              &lsquo;Pace facta, epulatus in navi cum Antonio et C&aelig;sare, non invenuste
              ait: <hi rend="italic">Hae sunt meae carinae;</hi> quia Romae in Carinis domum eius
              Antonius tenebat.&rsquo;&mdash;[cap. lxxxiv.] It is doubtful that even
              Theobald's insistence can make us believe that Shakespeare had Pompey's
              &lsquo;witticism&rsquo; here in mind; had he ever heard it or known it, an
              allusion to it would have been more appropriate in II, vi, 102, where Pompey says
              &lsquo;Aboord my Galley, I inuite you all.&rsquo; Is it not enough that
              Shakespeare found in Plutarch that Antony kept possession of Pompey's house? See <hi

              indignation is well known at Shakespeare's so-called tragedies which are only
              &lsquo;farces in which the burlesque and the horrible are united,&rsquo; and
              in which we see &lsquo;the lowest rabble appearing on the stage by the side of
              princes, and princes often using the same language as the mob.&rsquo; Judgements
              of this kind belong to a period in which the characters of a tragedy were merely
              regarded as so many lay figures, who were expected to act in a solemn and ceremonious
              manner, especial care being taken that they should speak in the most courtly style and
              be able to make court-curtseys; and they belong moreover to a country in which the
              spirit of society and of high-bred manners has always been peculiarly cultivated and
              prized, and this differs as widely from the humourous spirit as one of our garden
              plants does from a foreign wild flower. These adverse opinions, however, do not
              prevent the banquet on board Pompey's vessel from being a most excellent scene, and
              one even more thoroughly Shakespearian perhaps than the passages most celebrated for
              beauty in his plays, since in this particular kind of humourous presentation he is not

              rope that Pompey had only to say the word to have cut, and in which Lepidus,

              to indicate that the comrades and subordinates of the General appeared also in the
              procession. In this connection Delius suggests with ingenuity that we may infer from
              the somewhat fuller stage-directions in the present play, that Shakespeare was not

              myself have seen only in a picture; for, as the citizens of Helios say, it visits them
              only periodically, every five hundred years; they state that it always comes on the
              death of its sire. If it at all resembles its picture, it is thus and so: some of its
              feathers are golden-hued, and some are red; in shape and figure it most resembles the
              eagle and in size also. They say, but I cannot credit it, that this bird contrives to
              bring from Arabia to the temple of Helios the body of its father plastered up in
              myrrh, and there buries it. The mode of carrying it is as follows:&mdash;first, he
              plasters together an egg of myrrh as large as he is able to carry, after he has tested
              his strength by carrying it; this trial having been made, he hollows out the egg
              sufficiently to place his father within, then with fresh myrrh he fills up the space
              unoccupied by his father's body: the egg thereby becomes of the same weight as before,
              and thus plastered up he transports it to Egypt to the temple of Helios. Such things,
              they say, this bird can accomplish.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italic"

              contend over the meaning of &lsquo;Elements&rsquo; in this sentence; its
              meaning must be determined by the context. &lsquo;The elements&rsquo; mean, in
              general, earth, water, air, and fire, and of these man is supposed to be composed;
              &lsquo;the due proportion and commixture whereof in his composition,&rsquo;

              &lsquo;were what produced in him every kind of perfection, mental and
              bodily.&rsquo; Thus Cleopatra says, &lsquo;I am Fire, and Ayre; my other
              Elements [<hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> earth and water] I give to baser
              life.&rsquo;&mdash;V, ii, 341. Sir Toby Belch asks, &lsquo;Does not our
              liues consist of the foure elements?&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Twelfth
                Night,</hi> II, iii, 11. Or as Anthony in the present play says of the Crocodile,
              &lsquo;the elements once out of it, it Transmigrates.&rsquo;&mdash; II,
              vii, 52. The four elements may also exist external to man, and when used in the
              singular, &lsquo;the element&rsquo; may mean the <hi rend="italic">air</hi> or
              the <hi rend="italic">sky,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night,</hi> where
              Valentine says of Olivia, &lsquo;The Element itselfe, till seuen yeares heate,
              Shall not </p>
            <p>behold her face.&rsquo;&mdash;I, i, 31. Again, where Viola says to Olivia,
              &lsquo;O you should not rest Betweene the elements of ayre, and earth,&rsquo;
              etc. Or &lsquo;the element&rsquo; may mean <hi rend="italic">water,</hi> as
              where the Queen in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> says of Ophelia, when fallen in
              &lsquo;the weeping brook,&rsquo; that she was &lsquo;like a creature
              native and indued Unto that element.&rsquo;&mdash;IV, vii, 180. It is,
              therefore, quite possible in the present passage that &lsquo;the
              elements&rsquo; may mean either those which are external to man or those of which
              he is composed. If the former, then C&aelig;sar means no more than &lsquo;may
              you have a comfortable journey&rsquo;; an objection to this meaning is that a
              comfortable journey does not of necessity create cheerful spirits; there is the
              well-known line &lsquo;C&aelig;lum non animum mutant,&rsquo; etc., which
              suggests a sorrow ever-present, however comfortable the voyage. If by &lsquo;the
              elements&rsquo; C&aelig;sar means those of which Octavia's nature is composed,
              then Johnson's interpretation is just, and it would be presumptuous to attempt to
              better his paraphrase.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              words meant the exact opposite [to what he has said they mean]. The horse with a cloud
              in his face was one with no white star. Fitzherbert, in his <hi rend="italic">Boke of

              <hi rend="smallcap">Theobald</hi>: I have ventur'd to alter the tense of the verb
              here, against the authority of all the copies. There was no sense in it, I think, as
              it stood before. Enobarbus would say, &lsquo;Indeed, Antony seem'd very free of
              his tears that year; and, believe me, bewail'd all the mischief he did, till I myself
              wept too.&rsquo; This appears to me very sarcastical. Antony's tears, he would
              infer, were dissembled; but Enobarbus wept in real compassion of the havock and
              slaughter committed on his countrymen.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Capell</hi> (i,
              37): Which he thought would be never: so that, taking them thus, the words are only a

                >Wept</hi> (a word adopted by two modern editors) can not be allow'd of; the sense
              which that would convey, being a manifest violation of character.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: I am afraid there was better sense in this passage as
              it originally stood, than Theobald's alteration will afford us. &lsquo;Believe it
              (says Enobarbus), that Antony did so, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> that he wept over
              such an event, till you see me weeping on the same occasion, when I shall be obliged
              to you for putting such a construction on my tears, which, in reality (like his), will
              be tears of joy.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">M. Mason</hi>: I should
              certainly adopt Theobald's amendment, the meaning of which is, that Antony wailed the
              death of Brutus so bitterly, that I [Enobarbus] was affected by it, and wept also.
              Steevens's explanation of the present reading is so forced, that I cannot clearly
              comprehend it.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi>: Steevens and Capell vainly
              endeavour to </p>
            <p>defend [the Folio]. According to Capell, Theobald's correction introduces a violation
              of character; but Enobarbus is not altogether &lsquo;unused to the melting
              mood;&rsquo; for afterwards (IV, ii, 47) we find him saying, &lsquo;Looke,
              they weep; And <hi rend="italic">I, an ass, am onion-ey'd,</hi>&rsquo;
                etc.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">R. G. White</hi>: I have no hesitation in
              adopting Theobald's reading.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Keightley</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Expositor,</hi> p. 315): Theobald is followed, from not understanding
              the passage, as it seems to me; what is meant is, accept this explanation till you see
                <hi rend="italic">me</hi> weep from pure feeling, which Antony was no more capable
              of doing than I am.&mdash;[If Theobald's reading be correct, and Enobarbus did
              actually weep out of sympathy, I find it difficult to detect with what he sympathised.
              Certainly not with Anthony's tears; he has just said that they were due to a rheum. If
              Anthony's tears were genuine, his sarcastic allusion to a rheum is pointless. As a
              proof that tears from Enobarbus were not out of character, Dyce refers to a scene
              between Anthony and his followers where Enobarbus confesses he was
              &lsquo;onion-ey'd.&rsquo; But there is no parallelism between that scene and
              the present. It was the sight of the unfeigned tears of devoted affection for Anthony
              which in that scene brought tears to the eyes of Enobarbus. In Anthony's
              &lsquo;wailings&rsquo; over the &lsquo;slain Brutus&rsquo; whom he had
              himself &lsquo;willingly confounded,&rsquo; Enobarbus had no jot of faith, and
              he asks Agrippa to believe his words,&mdash;until Agrippa shall see him
              &lsquo;weep too,&rsquo; which, as Capell says, will be never.
              &lsquo;Weepe&rsquo; of the Folio should not be, I think,

              charm in Octavia. The latter part of the line is not at all consequent on what has
              just been said, but expresses the secret anxiety of the woman by her emphasis in
              uttering it. It would be better, perhaps, to print it as a separate
              sentence.&mdash;[This last interpretation is, to me, the true one. Cleopatra was
              thinking of herself, not of any quality of voice, and was, moreover, determined, as
              with the &lsquo;venom clamours of a jealous woman,&rsquo; to regard every
              quality of Octavia in the worst possible light. As for &lsquo;the

              Burchell, to ejaculate &lsquo;Fudge!&rsquo; It is quite as likely that he was

              apparent enough as the text stands: C&aelig;sar would not look to avoid taking the
              least hint, or if he did look, and took the hint, his praise was superficial and
              insincere.&rsquo; On this reading of Collier's MS Corrector, <hi rend="smallcap"
                >Dyce</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Notes,</hi> p. 153) remarks that &lsquo;it has not

              restores the genuine reading.&rsquo; Later, in his edition, Dyce is more emphatic
              and pronounces the emendation of Collier's MS &lsquo;little better than
              nonsense.&rsquo; Later still, in his <hi rend="italic">Strictures</hi> (p. 205) he
              criticises not the emendation of Collier's MS, but Collier himself for following the
              Folio. &lsquo;What,&rsquo; he asks, &lsquo;could induce Mr Collier to

              preparation will so show beside C&aelig;sar's that it will overpoweringly eclipse
              it or stain it, as also that it will stain the colour of C&aelig;sar's wishes to
              Antony's own. It will change or stain C&aelig;sar's gules to the olive colour of
              peace. Antony's greater preparation will so stain and colour C&aelig;sar and his
              purposes as to effect a total change in the latter; change them from thoughts of war
              to thoughts of the desirability and safety of peace. &mdash;[If we could but be
              perfectly sure that the effect on C&aelig;sar of Anthony's <hi rend="italic"
                >staining</hi> would be to evoke thoughts of peace, and not of somewhat excusable
              anger, Dr Nicholson's interpretation would be faultless and carry conviction.
              Unfortunately, however, prognostication is here doubtful, and
              &lsquo;stain&rsquo; cannot but convey a meaning which is, to say the least,
              uncomfortable. Hence the struggles of the critics to soften it. But is there any need
              of softening it? Be it as offensive as it will, it still remains the word of the text.
              Anthony's bearing towards Octavia is not deferential&mdash;hardly gentle. When he
              enters he is irritably dissenting from her, and we can see that he is providing for
              the speedy desertion of her, for which we were prepared, in the first hours after he
              was married, by his resolve to go to Egypt; where his pleasure lay.&mdash; II,

              &lsquo;seems to be the joint property of Capell and Johnson.&rsquo; Johnson
              assuredly proposed it in his edition published in 1765. Capell's edition (in which the
              emendation appears in the text printed in black letter as an indication that it is not
              in the original) is undated, but his Preface is dated 1767; and in a note on p. 18 of
              his <hi rend="italic">Introduction,</hi> he gives the dates at which his volumes went
              irregularly to the press: &lsquo;the first sheet of this work,&rsquo; he says,
              &lsquo;(being the first of volume 2) went to the press in September, 1760: and
              this volume was follow'd by volume 8 [the volume containing the present play], 4, 9,
              1, 6, and 7; the last of which was printed off in August, 1765.&rsquo; Guided by
              this note, I have hitherto uni&longs;ormly assumed that vol. 8 was printed in
              1761, four years before Johnson's edition. But Capell nowhere says that his volumes
              were issued in the years they were printed; hence, for aught we can tell, they may
              have all appeared on the same day in 1766 or 1767, a full year lag of Johnson's. The
              fact, therefore, appears to be that, as regards the present emendation, to Capell
              belongs the priority of devising and of printing, and to Johnson the priority of
              publication, and it is publication that confers the prize and decides the ownership.
              Unfortunately for both critics, however, it is to be feared that their claims may be
              somewhat shorn of their glory. Heath's <hi rend="italic">Revisal of Shakespeare's
              Text</hi> appeared in 1765, before either Johnson's edition or
              Capell's,&mdash;both refer to it. On p. 458, Heath remarks that there seemed to be
              an error in the present phrase which &lsquo;may be thus corrected,
              &ldquo;They'll grind <hi rend="italic">one</hi> th' other,&rdquo;&rsquo;
              which certainly contains the germ, afterwards expanded by both Capell and Johnson into
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">the one</hi> the other;&rsquo; </p>
            <p>their &lsquo;joint property&rsquo; turns out, therefore, to be the priceless

              </lemma> Wherever in Capell's text there appears a dagger inserted between words or
              phrases, it is an indication of some action to be taken by the speaker. For instance,
              where Cleopatra says to the Messenger, &lsquo;there is gold, and here My bluest
              veins to kiss,&rsquo; the lines thus appear in Capell's text: &lsquo;there is
              &dagger; gold and here &dagger; My bluest veins to kiss,&rsquo; indicating
              that Cleopatra extends one hand with gold and the other to be kissed; it would be
              truly deplorable were an actress to suppose that Egypt's queen uses her feet on this
              occasion, and against this easy error Capell kindly does all he can to protect her. In
              the present line, after &lsquo;garden&rsquo; Capell unsheaths a dagger, which
              means, I suppose, that Eros imitates Anthony's impatient strides. Here the little

              to have ever been taken; possibly because, being a matter of Capell's individual
              preference, it is impossible to gainsay it. It is like Henderson's reading

              </lemma> Julius C&aelig;sar was the great uncle of Octavius. That he is here
              called his &lsquo;father&rsquo; is, possibly, due to a passage in Plutarch's
                <hi rend="italic">Life of Brutus</hi> (p. 1063, ed. 1595; p. 123, ed. Skeat) where
              we find that Octavius C&aelig;sar &lsquo;was the sonne of lulius
              C&aelig;sars Nece, whom he had adopted for his sonne, and made his heire, by his
              last will and testament. But when Iulius C&aelig;sar his adopted father was
              slaine, he was,&rsquo; etc. At the first glance, it seems as though there were
              here two separate legal acts: an adoption as a son and the making of an heir; in
              reality there was but one. It was only by C&aelig;sar's Will that Octavius became
              an adopted son, and this was evidently so unusual and doubtful a process that Octavius
              afterward had the adoption confirmed by the curi&aelig;. &lsquo;The phrase of
              &ldquo;adoption by testament&rdquo; (Cic. <hi rend="italic">Brutus,</hi> 58)
              seems,&rsquo; says Prof. <hi rend="smallcap">George Long</hi> (Smith's <hi
                rend="italic">Dict. Greek and Roman Antiquities,</hi> s. v. <hi rend="italic"
                >Adoptio</hi>) &lsquo;to be rather a misapplication of the term; for though a </p>
            <p>man or woman might by testament name a heres, and impose the condition of the heres
              taking the name of the testator or testatrix, this so-called adoption could not
              produce the effects of a proper adoption. It could give to the person so said to be
              adopted, the name or property of the testator or testatrix, but nothing more. Niebuhr
                (<hi rend="italic">Lectures,</hi> vol. ii, p. 100) speaks of the testamentary
              adoption of C. Octavius by C. Julius C&aelig;sar, as the first that he knew of;
              but the passage of Cicero in the <hi rend="italic">Brutus</hi> and another passage
                (<hi rend="italic">Ad</hi> Hirt. viii, 8) show that other instances had occurred
              before. A person on passing from one gens into another, and taking the name of his new
              familia, generally retained the name of his old gens also, with the addition to it of
              the termination <hi rend="italic">-anus</hi> (Cic. <hi rend="italic">ad Att.</hi> iii,
              20, and the note of Victorius). Thus, C. Octavius, afterwards the Emperor Augustus,
              upon being adopted by the testament of his uncle, the dictator, assumed the name of
              Caius Julius C&aelig;sar Octavianus; but he caused the adoption to be confirmed by
              the curi&aelig;. As to the testamentary adoption of C. Octavius, see Drumann, <hi

              given.&rsquo; Were there any proof that Shakespeare had ever read Dion Cassius, I
              should not have referred to Plutarch as the possible source of this use of
              &lsquo;father.&rsquo; Dion Cassius speaks over and over again of Julius

              unloved&rsquo; may be, as Schmidt says, &lsquo;not felt,&rsquo; but the </p>
            <p>learned German is, I think, far astray when he holds the present phrase to be an
              instance of the common construction of a verb with its cognate accusative; nor are
              either of the examples which he quotes parallels to the present phrase. He was misled,
              I think, by the jingle of the words. Adriana asks, &lsquo;what ruins are there in
              me which cannot be found to have been made ruins by him?&rsquo; So, too, Cordelia
              deserves to experience the want of that affection in which she had herself been
              wanting. In what respect are these two examples parallel in construction to
              &lsquo;the ostentation of love which when left unshown is not felt&rsquo;? Of
              course, in the three paraphrases just given, cognate accusatives cannot be found, and
              for the simple reason that they do not exist in the original sentences; herein lay Dr
              Schmidt's error. In the interpretation of the present phrase it seems to me that there
              has been a misapprehension of the person by whom the love is felt. The generally
              accepted meaning seems to be that if there is no expression of love, love will soon
              cease to exist. This, however, implies the possibility that C&aelig;sar's love for
              his &lsquo;dearest sister&rsquo; might grow cold, which is hardly an
              expression of deep fraternal feeling. It amounts almost to a threat. Whereas,
              C&aelig;sar is pleading tenderly for himself, with gentle reproaches because
              Octavia has given him no chance to show his love for her, and urges that if there is
              no demonstration of his love she will soon cease to care whether he loves her or not,
              his love will be no longer prized; it becomes unvalued, &lsquo;unloved.&rsquo;

              &lsquo;abstract&rsquo; may be used with sufficient licence, it gives us the
              meaning which the poet would express, that Octavia was something separating Anthony
              from the gratification of his desires. It is better to hold to the original, seeing
              that Shakespeare sometimes employs words with a meaning peculiar to himself. His

              Rome, because therein lay an abridgement or curtailing of the hindrances between his
              lust and him; that is, between the lovers now separated by Octavia's presence. The
              majority of editors refer &lsquo;abstract&rsquo; to Octavia, instead of

              Delius's definition of &lsquo;abstract,&rsquo; with its reference to
              &lsquo;which,&rsquo; carries conviction; it is justly drawn from the strict
              meaning of the word. Schmidt's paraphrase is weak and inferior to that of Delius, from
              which it is, not improbably, derived. I cannot find &lsquo;abstract,&rsquo; as

              therefore, is, that the gods, in order to right Octavia, make ministers of justice of
              C&aelig;sar and of those that love Octavia.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Singer</hi>: It is impossible to conceive with [Collier] that the reference is to
              justice, which is not here personified, and, had it been, <hi rend="italic">his</hi>

              were disposed formerly to retain <hi rend="italic">his</hi> upon the supposition that
              it might agree with justice. We now think that Singer is warranted in the blame he
              imputes to us for so doing, and we amend the text, although not exactly in his way. It
              seems not impossible that originally &lsquo;gods&rsquo; was in the singular,

              twist was given by Capell's unfortunate semi-colon, which has been followed by every

              &lsquo;if these wars are now declared against me, why, etc. With the Folio
              reading, the only sense possible would be, &ldquo;if there is no special
              injunction against my taking part in these wars,&rdquo; etc.; but, as Antony alone
              could object, and he shows no inclination to do so, such sense seems very

              but it appears most decidedly where the historical material was undramatic, as in the

              the defeat at Actium, do so because they start with the notion that on great occasions
              Cleopatra could be truly brave, the splendid manner of her death having acquired for
              her a false reputation for courage; but her supposed heroism is only a brilliant
              theatrical cloak wrapped round the most feminine little person, presenting the most

            <p>is repeated in Collier's ed. ii, not, however, as Tyrwhitt's, but as that of

              &lsquo;ribaudred&rsquo; altered to <hi rend="italic">ribald,</hi> and
              &lsquo;nag&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">hag. Ribald,</hi> he continues,
              &lsquo;requires no explanation, whereas no instance of the use elsewhere either of
              &ldquo;ribaudred&rdquo; or &ldquo;ribauldred&rdquo; can be produced.
              There are, no doubt, such words as <hi rend="italic">ribaldry</hi> and <hi
                rend="italic">ribaldrous,</hi> but the employment of them by old authors proves
              nothing, since they are not the word wanted. &ldquo;Nag&rdquo; for <hi

              amending the word &ldquo;ribaudred&rdquo; to <hi rend="italic">ribaldrid,</hi>
              as was done by Steevens, gives the line a syllable too much.&rsquo; Tyrwhitt's

              Bishop Hall has <hi rend="italic">ribaldish,</hi> and so, I suspect, the Poet wrote
              here. [P. 90], Of course the epithet <hi rend="italic">ribald</hi> is applied to
              Cleopatra to express her notorious profligacy. It seems to me, also, that the Poet
              meant &lsquo;nag&rsquo; in reference to her speedy flight from the battle,
              carrying Antony off, as it were, on her back. And the words, &lsquo;the breese
              upon her,&rsquo; and &lsquo;like a cow in June&rsquo; naturally infer that
              such was the image intended.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Thiselton</hi> (p. 19):
              Read <hi rend="italic">riband-red</hi> for &lsquo;ribaudred&rsquo; on the
              following grounds. (1) No such word as &lsquo;ribaudred&rsquo; is known. (2)
              In the preceding line &lsquo;the Fight&rsquo; is likened to &lsquo;the
              Token'd Pestilence,&rsquo; the reference being to the Plague, of which there were
              three varieties; the red, the yellow, and the black. It is Cleopatra's red ribands
              that suggest the figure of the red plague to Scarrus. (3) Red ribands would match a
              dark complexion and the actor who played the part of Cleopatra may be presumed to have
              worn them. (4) Cleopatra will then be likened to a nag decked with red ribands as for
              a fair, anything but an &lsquo;Arme-gaunt steede.&rsquo; (5)
              &lsquo;Riband-red&rsquo; enhances the force and appropriateness of the
              imprecation in the next line, &lsquo;Whom Leprosie o'er-take,&rsquo; that
              disease being characterised by whiteness of the skin. (6) In the Folio the <hi
                rend="italic">u</hi> in the word usually given as &lsquo;ribaudred&rsquo; is
              raised above the level of the preceding and succeeding letters, and would therefore
              seem to be in reality an inverted <hi rend="italic">n.</hi>&mdash;[Suggestions
              from this critic are worthy of respectful consideration. But is it any more easy to
              apprehend the meaning of &lsquo;a riband-red nag&rsquo; than it is of
              &lsquo;a waistcoat-white gentleman&rsquo;? In <hi rend="italic">Mer. of

              183: &lsquo;disdain'd contempt.&rsquo; In all these cases, and many more could
              be added, the past participles convey the meaning that the nouns which they qualify
              are abundantly supplied with that which the participles represent. Thus,
              &lsquo;the guiled shore&rsquo; </p>
            <p>means the shore <hi rend="italic">full of guiles;</hi> &lsquo;the delighted

              &lsquo;disdain'd contempt&rsquo; means contempt <hi rend="italic">full of
                disdain.</hi>&rsquo; In Bishop Cooper's <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus
                Lingu&aelig; Roman&aelig;,</hi> 1573, we find, among the definitions of <hi
                rend="italic">Obsc&oelig;nitas,</hi> &lsquo;ribauldrie.&rsquo; If this
              noun be turned into a participle we have <hi rend="italic">ribauldried,</hi> which, I
              venture to suggest, is the very word, phonetically spelled, in our present
              &lsquo;ribaudred.&rsquo; (In the next scene, forty-seventh line, we have

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Capell</hi> (i, 39): These words puzzl'd the Oxford editor
              [Hanmer], and some others besides him; and that for want of duly reflecting upon the
              situation of the person who speaks them: Bury'd in thought and sightless, without
              knowledge of what is said to him or where he is, he just hears a voice; replies to it,
              as it had come from some courtier or other great person, and relapses immediately into
              the same train of thinking that engag'd him before; nor is he wak'd out of it, 'till
              Eros (either raising his voice, or shaking him) says&mdash;&lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">Sir, the queen.</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;[line 54. </p>
            <p>Capell is right, I think, in his interpretation of these words. Anthony is utterly
              unconscious of the world about him; but roused, for a second, by the voice, or,
              possibly, the respectful hand of Eros, he answers at random with instinctive courtesy,
              which, indeed, is pathetic in the circumstances, &lsquo;Yes, my lord,
              yes.&rsquo; <hi rend="smallcap">Staunton</hi>, however, apparently hears in the
              expression a somewhat petulant tone. &lsquo;This kind of rejoinder,&rsquo; he
              remarks, &lsquo;sometimes in play, sometimes in petulance, is not unfrequent in
              our old dramas. See <hi rend="italic">Mer. of Ven.</hi> II, ix, 89,
              90,&rsquo;&mdash;where a Messenger enters and asks, &lsquo;Where is my
              Lady?&rsquo; and Portia gaily replies, &lsquo;Here, what would my
              Lord?&rsquo; As instances similar to this reply of Portia, <hi rend="smallcap"
                >Dyce</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Remarks,</hi> p. 55) quotes <hi rend="italic">ad

              that from <hi rend="italic">Rich. II.</hi> should be eliminated, I think. There is
              neither gaiety nor petulance in Richard's reply to the Groom, but sarcasm, as the
              context shows. In his note on this same reply of Portia, Staunton says: &lsquo;a
              dozen instances may be cited, where a similar expression is used by an individual of
              station to one of very inferior rank&rsquo;; but he merely repeats those already
              given by Dyce, without any addition. In default, therefore, of more examples, we can
              hardly accept these three, Portia's, Prince Hal's, and Hog's, as sufficient to warrant
              the belief that this mode of expression was common; and the fact that in all of them
              there lies banter or sarcasm, is quite enough to deprive them of any similarity to
              Anthony's present words, which, I think, stand quite alone, and have been rightly
              interpreted by Capell. <hi rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi>, however, gives a different
              meaning to them. &lsquo;Antony,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;is muttering to
              himself under an overpowering sense of shame. In &ldquo;Yes, my lord,
              yes,&rdquo; he is referring to C&aelig;sar: &ldquo;Yes, C&aelig;sar,

              distance, from contrast, from privation, from change of fortune, from long-cherished
              passion; and contracts our view of life from a strange and romantic dream, long,

              >Abbott</hi> (&sect; 124) gives, with the remark that &lsquo;this [present]

              See notes, especially Walker's, on &lsquo;But being charg'd,&rsquo; IV, xi, 2,
              where &lsquo;But&rsquo; can hardly mean <hi rend="italic">only,</hi> and is
              almost uniformly said to mean <hi rend="italic">unless.</hi> In the present passage
                <hi rend="smallcap">Franz</hi> (&sect; 414, b. a.) observes that
              &lsquo;but&rsquo; is equivalent to <hi rend="italic">if . . . not;</hi> that
              is, &lsquo;death will seize her, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> your comfort does <hi
                rend="italic">not</hi> make the rescue&rsquo;; and quotes a parallel passage in
                <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night</hi> (III, i, 40) where Feste says, &lsquo;I
              would be sorry, sir, but the Foole should be as oft with your master, as with my

              where Boyet says, &lsquo;I am much deceived, but I remember the style.&rsquo;
              Where shades of meaning are in question, it is folly to be dogmatic. Yet if choice
              must be here made between the three meanings: &lsquo;but&rsquo; adversative,

              and &lsquo;but&rsquo; as equivalent to <hi rend="italic">if . . . not,</hi>
              the last seems, I think, the best. The use of the indicative </p>

              account of the similarity in the sense. But in <hi rend="italic">The Two Noble

              &ldquo;He no more needs me than <hi rend="italic">the</hi> ocean needs a few
              drops&rdquo;; while Shakespeare would have said, just as necessarily, &ldquo;I

              sea.&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;[There can be no doubt that the sentence is
              intelligible. Hanmer's emendation is, I think, logically just. It is extremely
              probable that the error is Shakespeare's. But it is one which demands some little
              mental analysis to detect and correct, in which, if we indulge, while sitting at the
              play, Euphronius will have delivered his message and departed before we have settled
              the propriety of his opening speech. And there are minds of a cast so ignoble as to
              prefer, where the sense is perfectly obvious, an incorrect word of Shakespeare to a
              correct one of Hanmer.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              is probable that here &lsquo;fooles&rsquo; refers, not to the domestic or

              (ii, 323), in his exhaustive essay <hi rend="italic">On the Clowns and Fools of

              or perhaps ridicule of a monk's crown. This practice is very ancient, and can be
              traced to the twelfth century. In one instance, the hair exhibits a sort of triple or
              Papal crown.&rsquo; The reference, in the present line, is a coarse one, but then
              Enobarbus was of coarse fibre. From what we know of the neglected personal habits of
              Fools, the inference is not strained that they were liable to cutaneous ailments, and
              of such ailments the only one that could &lsquo;nick&rsquo; anything was the
              &lsquo;itch,&rsquo; and the only thing it could nick was the hair. <hi

              without question, the common &ldquo;ringworm of the scalp,&rdquo; a frequent
              and well-defined affection, which causes the destruction of the hair, giving to the
              area invaded a nicked or cropped appearance, and in my works I describe the hair (as
              do many other writers) as seeming to have been &ldquo;nibbled off.&rdquo; It
              is due to a fungus, and the sensation of itching accompanies
                it.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              originally stood &lsquo;&mdash; may stop their <hi rend="italic"
              >sense.</hi>&rsquo; That is, their sense of smelling; which, not being understood,
              was changed into &lsquo;nose.&rsquo;&mdash;[Hereupon Staunton gives
              several quotations where <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> is applied to seeing, to
              hearing, to smelling; the most apposite is, &lsquo;You <hi rend="italic"

              &lsquo;blown&rsquo;:&mdash;&rsquo;Against the <hi rend="italic"

              Printers usually keep the names of the persons, who appear in each scene, ready
              composed; in consequence of which, speeches are often attributed to those to whom they
              do not belong. Is it probable that Enobarbus should presume to interfere here? The
              whole dialogue naturally proceeds between Cleopatra and Thyreus, till Enobarbus thinks
              it necessary to attend to his own interest, and says what he speaks when he goes out.
              The plural number (<hi rend="italic">us</hi>), which suits Cleopatra, who throughout
              the play assumes that royal style, strengthens </p>
            <p>my conjecture. The words, &lsquo;our master,&rsquo; it may be said, are
              inconsistent with this supposition; but I apprehend, Cleopatra might have thus
              described Antony, with sufficient propriety. They are afterwards explained:
              &lsquo;Whose he is, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are.&rsquo; Antony was the
              master of her fate.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: Enobarbus, who is the
              buffoon of the play, has already presumed to interfere between the jarring Triumvirs,
              and might therefore have been equally flippant on the occasion before us. For this
              reason, as well as others, I conceive the speech in question to have been rightly
              appropriated in the old copy. What a diminution of Shakspeare's praise would it be, if
              four lines that exactly suit the mouth of Enobarbus, could come with equal propriety
              from the lips of Cleopatra! </p>

              somewhat obscure, and the absolute use of an adjective, &lsquo;Royall&rsquo;
              does not help to make the phrase any clearer. In the last scene of the play,
              C&aelig;sar, looking on Cleopatra's fair corpse, says, &lsquo;She levell'd at

              bears no love to Anthony, and he has met no scornful denial; and now approaches the
              supreme moment, the sole object of his mission, when, with her own consent, he is to
              get her into C&aelig;sar's power. &lsquo;And put yourself,&rsquo; he
              slowly says, and pauses, watching, and would have said &lsquo;beyond
              temptation,&rsquo; or &lsquo;far from Anthony's power,&rsquo; or anything
              else to that effect, had he read a trace of cold suspicion in the eyes before him. But

              suppose that for this the editors of that edition find their authority in what
              Theobald says in his note, which reads thus: &lsquo;The Poet certainly wrote (as

              &lsquo;Disputation&rsquo; is perhaps equivalent to &lsquo;say to
              C&aelig;sar this, as the plea which I put in.&rsquo;&mdash;[It is not easy
              to see what valid objection there can be to &lsquo;disputation.&rsquo; To be
              sure, it is a large word for a fair woman's mouth, but it was not too large for poor
              Lucretia's. Possibly, Cleopatra wished to minimise as much as possible the
              uncomfortable fact that she had been actually at war with C&aelig;sar, so she
              called her warfare a &lsquo;disputation,&rsquo; which it certainly was, and a
              good deal more; but this she keeps in the background. Moreover, &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">in</hi> deputation&rsquo; is undeniably awkward; and besides, can
              a kiss be sent by proxy without giving it to the bearer? I ask in ignorance. These
              objections are, it seems to me, sufficient to awaken suspicion of any emendation, and

                >church-going bell</hi> is merely a bell for churchgoing; and the expression is

              Whereupon follows the second question, which would not have been asked had she not
              evidently been lost in thought. During her interview with Thidias she had been true to
              Anthony and had encouraged C&aelig;sar's ambassador only that she might discover
              the full extent of his master's plans. But now this outburst of Anthony's Berserker
              wrath could not but have its effect on her, and give her food for reflection. When the
              play opens, the question with her was how she should keep Anthony by her side; now the
              question looms up whether or not she should keep by the side of Anthony.
              C&aelig;sar's offer was perilously attractive. Small wonder that she was so
              abstracted that Anthony had to say, &lsquo;Dost thou hear, Lady?&rsquo; She

              overlooked that <hi rend="italic">estridge</hi> signifies a <hi rend="italic"
              >goshawk.</hi> In this sense the word is used in [the present passage in <hi

              wrote of the estridge or goshawk, not of the ostrich [in the present passage]. The
              same idea was present to the mind of Clifford when he thus taunted Richard, Duke of

              the ostrich, except the present, and two others, of which one is dated 1450, and the

                (<hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi>) gives of <hi rend="italic">Ostreger,
              Ostringer,</hi> has no reference to <hi rend="italic">Estridges,</hi> but the word
              comes, conclusively, from Asturia, in Spain. The image of a dove in its fright pecking
              at an African ostrich is to me so infinitely absurd that I would welcome any bird or
              beast that can prove a more rational substitute. The case of the ostrich is by no
              means improved when the quality is noted for which it is chiefly distinguished in the
              days of Shakespeare. Some of the examples in the <hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi> of
              the use of <hi rend="italic">estridge</hi> refer to its plumes, but the majority to a
              comfortable and enviable digestion, which successfully copes with nails and
              horse-shoes. It is hardly too much to say that in any allusion by Shakespeare to an
              ostrich, an audience of his day would be at once reminded of the bird's voracity, and,
              consequently, should a dove peck at an ostrich, the allusion would be at once
              interpreted as referring to a defence, not of eggs or young, but of nails or
              horse-shoes. After all, the question is of small moment. It is enough that Enobarbus,
              after his profoundly true saying that &lsquo;to be furious Is to be frighted out
              of fear,&rsquo;&mdash;one of those &lsquo;jewels, five words
              long,&rsquo; which sparkle for ever, &mdash;draws his illustration from the
              image of a dove, the type of timidity, which attacks, under the influence of fear,
              that from which it would otherwise fly in terror,&mdash;this, I prefer to believe,
              is a hawk, the dove's most terrible foe.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              this is so unfit a reply to be made by C&aelig;sar, that the editor could not but

              &lsquo;C&aelig;sar answered him, that he had many other ways to die, than
                so.&rsquo;&mdash;[<hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi> quotes with approval this

              passage] as we have it. [Maginn here quotes it, but reads line 9 as
              &lsquo;C&aelig;sar must <hi rend="italic">know.</hi>&rsquo;] Taking the
              repartee <hi rend="italic">literally</hi> as it appears in North, Shakespeare's
              ordinary practice may afford a better reading: &lsquo;Let the old ruffian know
              &verbar; He hath many other ways to die than so. &verbar; Meantime, I laugh
              at's challenge. <hi rend="italic">Mec.</hi> C&aelig;sar must know,&rsquo;
              &verbar; . . . Is it any very violent conjecture to imagine that Shakespeare had
              seized the spirit of Plutarch and had written the <hi rend="italic">exact</hi> words
              of North, without alteration of a letter, except the necessary change of ha<hi
                rend="italic">th</hi> for ha<hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and that some printing or
              editorial blundering has jumbled the pronouns. The supposition is in complete
              conformity with Shakespeare's practice, and it removes the metrical
              difficulty.&mdash;[It is patent that North's translation is ambiguous. It makes
              little difference whether the ambiguity is due to North or to Amyot; there it is in
              North's text, and Shakespeare accepted the interpretation which he preferred as most
              in harmony with his idea of his characters; I do not see what right we have to change
              his words because we happen to think that C&aelig;sar is thereby rendered
              pusilanimous. If Shakespeare represents C&aelig;sar as conscious of his
              inferiority in single combat with Anthony (and he might very well be so, he was much
              younger and in delicate health), and, therefore, assured that he would fall, was
              afraid to meet Anthony, have we any right to change Shakespeare's words and remodel
              his characters? In the original Greek there is no ambiguity:&mdash;LXXV. <foreign
                lang="greek">*ra/lin d) *)antw/nios e)remre, *kai/sapa monomaxh_sai rpokalou/menos.

                sumfponh\sas</foreign>, etc. Nor is there any ambiguity in the Latin version, which,
              it is said, Amyot followed at times:&mdash;&lsquo;Porro prouo</p>
            <p>cauit denuo per nuntios Antonius C&aelig;sarem, vt solus secum certaret. qui
              resp&omacr;dit, Vias Antonio multas pat&ecirc;re interritum.&rsquo; It is
              in Amyot that the ambiguity is to be found, and North is
              exonerated:&mdash;&lsquo;Et Antonius envoya une austrefois deffier
              C&aelig;sar, et luy presenter le combat d'homme &agrave; homme.

              1784. Dryden follows Shakespeare: Anthony tells Ventidius that C&aelig;sar's
              answer was, &lsquo;He had more ways than one to die.&rsquo; I think there
              should be, in the present line, a period after &lsquo;dye&rsquo;; it concludes
              the message. &lsquo;Laugh&rsquo; is, it seems to me, in the imperative, and

              improbable&rsquo; is to me precisely the reason which renders it extremely
              probable. It would be &lsquo;damnable iteration&rsquo; indeed, to have called
              out &lsquo;mine armour&rsquo; three times. Is it not universal that an
              exclamation or a question is varied at the second or third repetition of its
              substance? It is, to me, eminently natural that Anthony should have changed his

              makes it &aelig;sthetically endurable. When she is arming him for his last battle,
              her determination is already taken. She knows well enough that what must here decide
              is not the heroic courage of a warrior, but wary judgement and essential superiority.

              Among these valuable emendations is the present, which affords a striking improvement

              Shakspeare has extricated himself with great address. He has admitted all those great

              </lemma> On this puzzling phrase we get but small light from the commentators. It is
              not difficult to draw an explanation from the &lsquo;depths of one's
              consciousness,&rsquo; as Theobald and Capell seem to have drawn from theirs, and
              say, with them, that according to primitive geography there were but three countries
              in the world: Europe, Asia, and Africa, and that these made the &lsquo;three
              angles.&rsquo; But three angles do not make three nooks; they may make only two.
              From Malone to the present day there has been quoted, as parallel to the present
              passage, the closing lines in <hi rend="italic">King John,</hi> where the Bastard
              says, &lsquo;Come the three corners of the world in arms, And we shall shock
              them.&rsquo; But, even in this passage, what the &lsquo;three
              corners&rsquo; are, is very doubtful; it has been even suggested that they may
              have been the Pope, France, and Spain. Whatever they were, England is supposed to be
              the fourth corner, which alone, I think, removes the parallelism with &lsquo;three
              nook'd.&rsquo; Again it has been surmised that the present allusion is to the fact
              that the world had been divided among C&aelig;sar, Anthony, and Lepidus. If this
              be so, it is extremely difficult, to me at least, to imagine why C&aelig;sar,
              Anthony, and Lepidus should be termed &lsquo;nooks.&rsquo; There is, however,
              one possible source of information, namely, in Shakespeare's supposed familiarity with
              the Emblem writers. The proofs of this familiarity which <hi rend="smallcap"
              >Green</hi> has gathered on this subject are, when taken singly, of doubtful value,
              but become respectable by accumulation. On p. 350 of his <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare
                and the Emblem Writers,</hi> we find the following: &lsquo;Curious it is to note
              how slowly the continent which Columbus discovered became fully recognised as an
              integral portion of &ldquo;the inhabited world.&rdquo; . . . Brucioli's <hi
                rend="italic">Trattato della Sphera,</hi> Venice, 1543, . . . in dividing the globe
              into climates, does not take a single instance except from what is named the Old
              World; in fact the New World of America is never mentioned. Somewhat later, in 1564,
              when Sambucus published his <hi rend="italic">Emblems,</hi> and presented <hi
                rend="italic">Symbols of the parts of the Inhabited Earth,</hi> he gave only three
              [parts: Europe, Asia, and Africa, as comprising the whole world.] . . . Shakespeare's
              geography, however, though at times defective, extended further than its
              &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; by Sambucus. He refers to America and the Indies in <hi
                rend="italic">Com. of Err.</hi> III, ii, 131, and to the East and West Indies in <hi
                rend="italic">The Merry Wives,</hi> I, iii, 64. Yet in agreement with the map of
              Sambucus, [where] the three Capes prominent upon it, are the Gibraltar Rock, the Cape
              of Good Hope, and that of Malacca, Shakespeare, on other occasions, ignores America
              and all its western neighbours. At the consultation by Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus
              about the division of the Roman Empire, Antony, on the exit of Lepidus, asks,
              &ldquo;is it fit, The three-fold world divided, he should stand One </p>
            <p>of the three to share it?&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Jul.
              C&aelig;s.</hi> IV, i, 12. And again he speaks of the &ldquo;threenook'd
              world&rdquo;&rsquo; [in the present passage. The wood-cut which Green gives of
              the map of Sambucus presents only three great nooks in the world, one is formed by the
              Mediterranean, a second by the Red Sea, and a third is hard to identify, but is
              possibly the Bay of Bengal. According to this small map or Emblem (for the three
              divisions of the earth are dominated by animals), the world can assuredly be styled
              &lsquo;three nooked.&rsquo; Whether or not Shakespeare ever saw it is a
              question which is open to all the doubt that anyone may choose to apply to it. That
              Shakespeare was, at least, familiar with Emblems has very lately received a
              conspicuous proof by the discovery of a payment to him and to Burbadge for designing
              an impresa for the sixth Earl of Rutland.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              prove: &lsquo;on her breast There is a vent of Bloud, and something <hi
                rend="italic">blowne.</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;[This interpretation of
              &lsquo;blowe&rsquo; seems to me weak, and far from adequate to Enobarbus's
              deep emotion. And yet I have none better to offer, except by hermeneutical torture. To
              give it force, Dr Johnson has to add, &lsquo;so that it will quickly
              break,&rsquo; but this is wholly his addition, and is not, of necessity, inherent
              in the simple word &lsquo;blows.&rsquo; Unquestionably, Shakespeare frequently
              uses &lsquo;blow&rsquo; in the sense of <hi rend="italic">swell, puff up,</hi>
              etc.; and there is a passage in <hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> which seems strongly to
              strengthen this sense in the present sentence. It is where Lear says, &lsquo;O,
              how this mother swells up toward my heart!&rsquo;&mdash;(II, iv, 54.) And yet
              I am not satisfied. The hermeneutical torture, as pedantic schoolmen would say, to
              which I referred, is based on the right to use any extreme, legitimate interpretation.
              Now Shakespeare does, once or twice, use &lsquo;blow&rsquo; in the sense of
                <hi rend="italic">break, shatter,</hi> as the result of an explosion. Hamlet says,
              &lsquo;'tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with </p>
            <p>his own petar; and 't shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines, And
              blow them at the moon.&rsquo; I know the phrase here is &lsquo;blow <hi
                rend="italic">at,</hi>&rsquo; which differentiates it from
              &lsquo;blow,&rsquo; used absolutely. Yet the drift of the sentence is that
              &lsquo;blow&rsquo; is here used as a result of a sudden and violent force, and
              we may well imagine that its effect was shattering. Again, to return to the
              interpretative torture, at the close of <hi rend="italic">Henry the Eighth,</hi> the
              Porter's Man, speaking of a fellow in the crowd with a fiery nose, says &lsquo;he
              stands there, like a mortar piece, to blow us.&rsquo;&mdash;V, iv, 48.
              Wherefore, I should like, on this faint possibility, to found a belief that in
              &lsquo;This blows my heart&rsquo; there lies in &lsquo;blows&rsquo; a
              meaning stronger than <hi rend="italic">swells,</hi>&mdash;one that involves the
              idea of <hi rend="italic">breaking.</hi> It is possibly noteworthy that the
              punctuation of the Folio after &lsquo;heart&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;not&rsquo; has been uniformly, and perhaps justly, discarded for that
              of Rowe. Although the punctuation of Shakespeare's compositors is not, in general, of
              an all-commanding value, yet, in the present instance, it seems to imply that the
              thought of his turpitude will break his heart, if it be not already broken by swift
                remorse.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

                rend="italic">to beshrew</hi> are used by our old writers in the sense of to curse,
              which latter verb, again, also primarily and properly (from the A.S. <hi rend="italic"
                >cursan</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cursian</hi>) signifies to vex or torment. Now, it
              is a strong confirmation of the derivation of <hi rend="italic">shrewd</hi> from the
              verb <hi rend="italic">to shrew</hi> that we find <hi rend="italic">shrewd</hi> and
                <hi rend="italic">curst</hi> applied to the disposition and temper by our old
              writers in almost, or rather in precisely, the same sense. Shakespeare himself affords
              us several instances. Thus, in <hi rend="italic">Much Ado About Nothing</hi> (II, i),
              Leonato having remarked to Beatrice, &lsquo;By my troth, niece, thou wilt never
              get a husband if thou be so <hi rend="italic">shrewd</hi> of thy tongue,&rsquo;
              his brother Antonio adds, assentingly, &lsquo;In faith, she's too <hi
                rend="italic">curst.</hi>&rsquo; So, in <hi rend="italic">A Midsummer Night's
                Dream</hi> (III, ii), Helena, declining to reply to a torrent of abuse from Hermia,
              says, &lsquo;I was never <hi rend="italic">curst;</hi> I have no gift at all in
                <hi rend="italic">shrewishness.</hi>&rsquo; And in <hi rend="italic">The Taming
                of the Shrew</hi> (I, ii), first we have Hortensio describing Katharine to his
              friend Petruchio as &lsquo;intolerable <hi rend="italic">curst,</hi> and <hi
                rend="italic">shrewd,</hi> and froward,&rsquo; and then we have Katharine, the
              shrew, repeatedly designated &lsquo;Katharine the <hi rend="italic"
              >curst.</hi>&rsquo; At the end of the Play she is called &lsquo;a curst
              shrew,&rsquo; that is, as we might otherwise express it, an ill-tempered shrew. .
              . . As it is in words that ill-temper finds the readiest and most frequent vent, the
              terms <hi rend="italic">curst,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">shrew,</hi> and <hi
                rend="italic">shrewd,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">shrewish</hi> are often used with a
              special reference to the tongue. But sharpness of tongue, again, always implies some
              sharpness of understanding as well as of temper. The terms <hi rend="italic"
              >shrewd</hi> and <hi rend="italic">shrewdly,</hi> accordingly, have come to convey
              usually something of both of these qualities,&mdash;at one time, perhaps, most of
              the one, at another of the other. The sort of ability that we call <hi rend="italic"
                >shrewdness</hi> never suggests the notion of anything very high: the word has
              always a touch in it of the sarcastic or disparaging. But, on the other hand, the
              disparagement which it expresses is never without an admission of something also that
              is creditable or flattering. Hence it has come to pass that a person does not hesitate
              to use the terms in question even of himself and his own judgments or conjectures. We
              say, &lsquo;I shrewdly suspect or guess.&rsquo; or &lsquo;I have a shrewd
              guess, or suspicion,&rsquo; taking the liberty of thus asserting or assuming our
              own intellectual acumen under cover of the modest confession at the same time of some
              little ill-nature in the exercise of it. Even when <hi rend="italic">shrewd</hi> is
              used without any personal reference, the sharpness which it implies is generally, if
              not always, a more or less unpleasant sharpness. &lsquo;This last day was a shrewd
              one to us,&rsquo; says one of the Soldiers of Octavius to his comrade, in [the
              present passage], after the encounter in which they had been driven back by Antony
              near Alexandria. </p>

                rend="italic">solemnly.</hi>&mdash;[In the propriety of this definition the
              Shakespearian world seems to be gradually acquiescing, after a temporary flurry
              started in 1853 by the publication of the MS emendations in <hi rend="smallcap"
                >Collier's</hi> Second Folio. The change, therein prescribed, from
              &lsquo;demurely&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">do early,</hi> coupled with
              Collier's assertion that the adverb &lsquo;demurely&rsquo; &lsquo;is
              surely ill suited to the sound of drums,&rsquo; seems to have demurely wakened the
              sleeping critics, always so zealously at hand to help Shakespeare express his thoughts
              and endow his purposes with words. The <hi rend="italic">Text. Notes</hi> show the
              result. As none of these emendations has been approved by anybody but the emenders
              themselves, it seems needless to rehearse the arguments by which they are maintained.
              The latest interpretation, fully in accord with Warburton's, is authoritative, and
              with many critics will close all discussion once and for ever. Dr <hi rend="smallcap"
                >Murray</hi> (<hi rend="italic">N. E. D. s. v.</hi> &dagger; b.) thus defines
              &lsquo;demurely&rsquo; in the present passage: &lsquo;In a subdued
              manner.&rsquo; Why &lsquo;demurely&rsquo; is thus appropriate is set forth
              by Dr <hi rend="smallcap">B. Nicholson</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Notes &amp;
              Qu.</hi> IV. viii, 41): C&aelig;sar, like Antony, would renew the combat, and
              taking advantage of &lsquo;the shining&rsquo; of the cloudless night, and a
              precaution from it, ordered the embattling of his forces to begin as early as 2 <hi
                rend="smallcap">a.m.</hi> It would, therefore, only be in accord with his careful
              and exact discipline that any notes of preparation should, in presence of a hostile
              and almost victorious force, be made in a subdued tone. Otherwise the enemy might have
              unnecessary information and forewarning, or even make such notes of preparation their
              signal of attack, and come upon him while defiling out of camp and before his line of
              battle had been taken up. But there is yet another and second meaning which may be
              given to the word <hi rend="italic">demure.</hi> If not now, yet at all events in 1814
              the drum-reveill&eacute; of the non-Latin races was not a lively, merry, or
              clamorous din, but a measured and somewhat solemn beat; and, judging from this and
              from the discipline of Gustavus Adolphus and other considerations, it seems not
              unlikely that the drum-reveill&eacute; of the Low Country, or German Protestant
              armies of Elizabeth's time, was of the same character, even if it were not founded on </p>
            <p>a psalm tune. In one of those inartificial touches of reality and circumstance which
              give such a charm to the tales of Erckmann and Chatrian, the soldier-conscript of the
              first Napoleon (<hi rend="italic">Waterloo,</hi> ch. xviii) incidentally tells
              us&mdash;&lsquo;Notre diane commence toujours avant celle des Prussiens, des
              Russes, des Autrichiens, et de tous nos ennemis; c'est comme le chant de l'alouette au
              tout petit jour. Les autres, avec leurs larges tambours, commencent apr&egrave;s
              leurs roulements sourds, qui vous donnent des id&eacute;es
              d'enterrement.&rsquo; (&lsquo;The others, with their big drums, begin later,
              and their dull-sounding rolls awake in one the remembrance of a burial.&rsquo;)
              Now this I take to be a perfect gloss on <hi rend="italic">demurely</hi> in the sense
              of solemnly, as explained by Warburton. But the one meaning does not exclude the
              other, and both would be easily understood by an audience, since they were interpreted
              by actual beat of drum within. This piece of stage arrangement furnishes, moreover,
              another important argument in their favour. Even an inferior artist would not
              foolishly mar with the ill accord of a lively rataplan the close of so touching and
              effective a scene. Nor could Shakespeare do so; but he would make use of that which he
              knew would harmonise with and heighten the feelings he had produced, and the measured,
              low-toned and far-off beats that demurely woke the sleepers were heard as the knell of
              one whom the hand of death had already raught, the funeral march for the erring but
              repentant soldier. </p>

              must have been said by Antony, connected with the next line, and relative to the place
              where the enemy might be reconnoitred. The <hi rend="italic">haven itself</hi> was not
              such a place; but rather some hill from which the haven and the ships newly put forth
              could be viewed. What Antony says upon his re-entry, proves decisively that he had not
              gone to the haven, nor had any thoughts of going thither. &lsquo;I see (says he),

              The sentence,&mdash;&lsquo;Order for sea is given They have put forth the

              their appointment we may best discover.&rsquo; The editors allow nothing for the

                >fawning obsequiousness</hi> of an animal, or an attendant, is connected with the
              word <hi rend="italic">candy.</hi> The cause of this strange association I am unable
              to discover; though the reader must know but little of the human mind&mdash;of
              Shakspeare&mdash;or even of the ordinary doctrine of <hi rend="italic"

              passages connected by <hi rend="italic">accident.</hi> When the reader shall be
              convinced respecting the truth of this observation; his curiosity will be much
              gratified by the following lines from the <hi rend="italic">Tempest;</hi> in which he
              will perceive that the same association still occupied the mind of the Poet, though a
              single <hi rend="italic">word</hi> only is apparent, which relates to one portion of
              the preceding metaphor. &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Seb.</hi> But, for your

              is to be referred to the former expressions, &lsquo;page thy <hi rend="italic"

                >heels,</hi>&rsquo; though it is applied to a very different metaphor. Let me
              add, that the quaintness of the imagery is an argument for the remoteness of the
              original. Though I cannot explain to the reader the cause of this association between
              the term <hi rend="italic">candy</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">fawning of a dog;</hi>
              I can diminish his surprise respecting its existence, by producing another case, which
              contains a direct union between this animal and an idea equally remote; and which
              certainly would have appeared altogether as extraordinary, unless we had possessed a
              clue to unravel the mystery. What should we say, were we to find in an ancient Greek
              writer a combination between the <hi rend="italic">fawning of a dog</hi> and the <hi
                rend="italic">cleansing of hands.</hi> The union, however, is so intimate, that
              among the Lacedemonians the name for the substance, which they sometimes used for
              cleansing of the hands, is derived from the animal.&mdash;[Hereupon follows an
              explanation of this strange association. The subject is not, however, germane to <hi

                (<hi rend="italic">s. v.</hi> Discandy): It is to be wished that something could be
              suggested in the place of &lsquo;spaniel'd me at heels,&rsquo; which might
              appear to lead to the subsequent idea of <hi rend="italic">discandying. Hearts</hi>
              that <hi rend="italic">spaniel'd</hi> Antony at the heels, <hi rend="italic">melting
                their sweets</hi> upon C&aelig;sar, forms a masterpiece of incongruity, which,
              amidst the natural, though rapid transitions of Antony's </p>
            <p>passionate state, we should not expect to find.&mdash;[Be it borne in mind that
              Whiter attempts merely to show that in Shakespeare's mind there was, possibly
              unconsciously, an association of ideas which harmonised what to us seems discordant.

              <hi rend="smallcap">Sir J. Hawkins</hi>: This is a term to signify a cheating game, of
              which the following is a description. A leathern belt is made up into a number of
              intricate folds, and placed edgewise upon a table. One of the folds is made to
              resemble the middle of the girdle, so that whoever should thrust a skewer into it
              would think he held it fast to the table; whereas, when he has so done, the person
              with whom he plays may take hold of both ends, and draw it away. This trick is now
              known to the common people, by the name of <hi rend="italic">pricking at the belt</hi>

              </lemma> In a letter to Theobald, in May, 1729 (Nichols, <hi rend="italic"
              >Illust.</hi> ii, 228) the Rev. <hi rend="smallcap">Styan Thirlby</hi> proposed the
              change of &lsquo;dolts&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">doits.</hi> Theobald, in
              his edition refers to Warburton's knowledge of this emendation; when Warburton's
              edition appeared, in 1747, he made no reference to Thirlby, but put forth the
              emendation as his own, and to him it has been wrongly accredited ever since, until the
              appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Text. Notes</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Cam.
              Ed.</hi> Theobald's own note on the word thus concludes, after giving his reasons for
              rejecting <hi rend="italic">doits:</hi> &lsquo;Perhaps the Poet's meaning may be,
              that Cleopatra should become a show, a spectacle to the scum and rabble of Rome; to
              blockheads, and people of the lowest rank. Cleopatra speaks twice afterwards to the
              same effect [see V, ii, 65, and 252].&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Warburton</hi>: As the allusion here is to monsters carried about in shows, it is
              plain, that the words, &lsquo;for poorest diminutives,&rsquo; must mean for
              the least piece of money. We must therefore read: &lsquo;for <hi rend="italic"
                >doits,</hi>&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> farthings, which shows what he
              means by &lsquo;poorest diminutives.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Capell</hi> (i, 46, reading <hi rend="italic">doits</hi>): Had
              &lsquo;dolts&rsquo; been the word, the Poet would have said, <hi rend="italic"
                >to</hi> dolts, <hi rend="italic">to</hi> poor'st diminutives; as he has, two lines
              higher, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">to</hi> the shouting plebeians&rsquo;; which
              very words led him to &lsquo;for&rsquo; and to <hi rend="italic">doits,</hi>
              to avoid a co-incidence of thoughts and expression in lines so near one
                another.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Tyrwhitt</hi> (in answer to Warburton's
              note): There was surely no occasion for the poet <hi rend="italic">to show what he
                meant</hi> by <hi rend="italic">purest diminutives.</hi> The expression is clear
              enough, and certainly acquires no additional force from the explanation. I rather
              believe we should read: &lsquo;For poor'st diminutives, <hi rend="italic">to
                dolts;</hi>&rsquo; This aggravates the contempt of her supposed situation; to be
              shown, <hi rend="italic">as monsters are,</hi> not only <hi rend="italic">for the
                smallest piece of money,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">to the most stupid and vulgar
                spectators.</hi>&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: I have received the
              emendation made by Warburton, because the letter <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> in
              consequence of the dot over it, is sometimes confounded with <hi rend="italic">l</hi>
              at the press. It appears to me much more probable that &lsquo;dolts&rsquo;
              should have been printed for <hi rend="italic">doits,</hi> than that
              &lsquo;for&rsquo; should have been substituted for <hi rend="italic">to.</hi>
              Whichsoever of these emendations be admitted, there is still a difficulty. Though
              monsters are shown to the stupid and the vulgar for &lsquo;poor'st
              diminutives,&rsquo; yet Cleopatra, according to Antony's supposition, would
              certainly be exhibited to the Roman populace <hi rend="italic">for nothing.</hi> Nor
              can it be said that he means that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> would be exhibited <hi
                rend="italic">gratis,</hi> as monsters are </p>
            <p>shown for small pieces of money; because his words are &lsquo;monster-like, be
              [thou] shown for poor'st diminutives.&rsquo; I have sometimes therefore thought
              that Shakspeare might have written: &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Fore</hi> poor
              diminutives, <hi rend="italic">fore</hi> dolts.&rsquo; The following passage in
                <hi rend="italic">Tro. and Cress.</hi> adds some support to my conjecture:
              &lsquo;How the poor world is pestered with such waterflies, <hi rend="italic"
                >diminutives</hi> of nature!&rsquo; [V, i, 38.]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Knight</hi>: We believe that the &lsquo;poor'st diminutives&rsquo; are the
              lowest of the populace, as the &lsquo;dolts&rsquo; are the most stupid. We
              must therefore understand &lsquo;for&rsquo; to mean, for the gratification of;
              or adopt Malone's suggestion of &lsquo;be shown <hi rend="italic"
              >fore,</hi>&rsquo; etc.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi> pronounces this
              explanation of Knight &lsquo;very curious,&rsquo; quotes Knight's
              understanding of &lsquo;for,&rsquo; and subjoins his favourite exclamation
                mark.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Deighton</hi> (reading <hi rend="italic"
              >doits</hi>): With the reading [of the Folio] &lsquo;for&rsquo; could only
              have the sense of &lsquo;for the gratification of,&rsquo; a very forced one;
              while Malone's objection that Cleopatra would be shown for nothing is of little value,
              since Shakespeare was evidently thinking of the exhibition of monsters, strange
              fishes, etc., at fairs, etc., in his own country. Compare <hi rend="italic"
              >Tempest,</hi> II, ii, 28-34.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Rolfe</hi> (reading
              &lsquo;dolts&rsquo;): But the reference is to Cleopatra's being led in triumph
              through the streets of Rome, a &lsquo;free show&rsquo; for the rabble, not to
              her being exhibited for a fee. Besides it seems more natural for Antony to emphasize
              the low character of the spectators than the pettiness of the price charged, if there
              were any. The only other instance of &lsquo;diminutives&rsquo; is in <hi
                rend="italic">Tro. &amp; Cress.</hi> V, i, 38, where it means insignificant
              persons. &lsquo;Monster-like&rsquo; is equivalent to as a monstrosity; but it
              is not necessary to see any reference to the fact that monsters were exhibited for
              money.&mdash;[The defence of the Folio may well be left in the hands of Theobald
              and of Rolfe. The degradation lay in being exhibited at all, not in any sum charged
              for &lsquo;admission.&rsquo; And it is noteworthy how deeply the taunt sank
              into Cleopatra's mind by her double reference to it afterward, and how her fateful
              imagination magnified it by her description of the atmosphere arising from the greasy
              mechanics, the dolts, and poorest diminutives. Dyce calls Knight's interpretation of
              &lsquo;for&rsquo; &lsquo;very curious,&rsquo; and Deighton pronounces
              it &lsquo;very forced.&rsquo; Compare, &lsquo;For Banquo's issue have I

              cowardice will be exposed. Compare <hi rend="italic">Jul. C&aelig;s.</hi> II, ii,
              32, &lsquo;Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never </p>
            <p>taste of death but once.&rsquo;&mdash;[I find it impossible to accept
              Deighton's paraphrase of this difficult passage, and it is the only paraphrase that
              any editor or critic, as far as I know, has vouchsafed us. The
              &lsquo;many&rsquo; deaths cannot refer to imaginary deaths, as Deighton
              supposes; if he is correct, the inference is clear that it would be a present mercy to
              kill every coward who fears to die, which would go near to depopulate the world.
              Anthony does not say that Cleopatra's present death would prevent many future deaths,
              real or imaginary, but his words are that her death (in time past) &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">might have prevented</hi> many&rsquo; (others, of soldiers slain
              in battle). In this case, &lsquo;better 'twere thou fell'st&rsquo; is
              equivalent to &lsquo;better 'twere thou shouldst have
              fallen,&rsquo;&mdash; the sequence of tenses will hardly permit
              &lsquo;fell'st&rsquo; to be the perfect indicative. Can it be that in
              Anthony's present conviction of Cleopatra's treachery there rise in his memory past
              occasions when he mistrusted her, notably her reception of C&aelig;sar's
              messenger? and he now sees that it would have been better had she fallen under his
              fury then? and by one death &lsquo;might have prevented

              >Heath</hi> (p. 463): While Antony is contemplating his present inevitable ruin,
              brought upon him, as he thought, by the treachery of the woman who was dearest to him,
              his imagination presents to him his supposed ancestor Hercules in circumstances
              exactly parallel, wrapped up, by the instrumentality of Deianira's deceived jealousy,
              in the poisoned shirt of Nessus, from which it was impossible he could ever extricate
              himself alive. Upon this point, his imagination taking fire transports him almost to a
              delirium. He fancies himself to be a real Hercules, and the shirt of Nessus to be
              actually upon him; and, after invoking his ancestor to inspire him with the same rage,
              with which he was actuated on the like occasion, he is instantly on the wing to exert
              it in the very same effects, in the lodging Lichas on the horns of the moon, and in
              subduing his worthiest self, with those very Herculean hands that grasped the heaviest
              club. All which, when stripped of those violent figures in which his heated
              imagination had cloathed it, terminates in no more than this, the taking the severest
              vengeance on the instrument of his ruin, and putting an end to his life by his own
              hands. The most exceptionable expression perhaps is, the bestowing the epithet, <hi
                rend="italic">worthiest,</hi> on himself; but even this exaggeration will appear
              excusable at least, if not justifiable, when it is considered, that it is not
              seriously intended as a vain-glorious vaunt, but proceeds wholly from a transport of
              the fancy, which represents him to himself for that moment as the very Hercules in

              puffiness of what he speaks next, should be consider'd as specimens of that Asiatick
              tumour of diction, which the Poet (using Plutarch's authority) has made a part of his

              were acted or tableaux represented; especially in early use, the movable structure or

              air performances of the mystery plays. 3. A tableau, representation, allegorical
              device, or the like, erected on a fixed stage or carried on a moving car, as a public
              show; any kind of show, device, or temporary structure, exhibited as a feature of a
              public triumph or celebration. (This sense, in which &lsquo;scene&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;stage&rsquo; are combined, may have been the intermediate link between
              1 and 2.)&mdash;[In conclusion Dr Murray gives an extremely valuable <hi

              which were &lsquo;a scene displayed on a stage&rsquo; and &lsquo;a stage
              on which a scene is exhibited or acted.&rsquo; Unfortunately this purely
              philological question is not germane to these pages. It is not to be supposed that in
              using the word &lsquo;Pageants&rsquo; Shakespeare had in mind the uncouth

              >Moralities</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mysteries.</hi> The pageants of his day were
              elaborate, allegorical, and superbly furnished. <hi rend="smallcap">Warton</hi> (ii,

              greatly contributed to cherish the spirit of allegorical poetry, and even to enrich
              the imagination of Spenser. [<hi rend="italic">Footnote.</hi>] And of Shakespeare.
              There is a passage [the present,] in <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra,</hi>
              where the metaphor is exceedingly beautiful; but where the beauty both of the

              conceive their impression on the minds of those to whom they were familiar, unless he

              reflects on the immense sums which were lavished on these occasions; and considers
              that the most celebrated artists and poets of the age were employed in displaying
              before a voluptuous Court the most consummate specimens of their skill, he will
              readily </p>

                >Malone</hi>: I believe Warburton here, as in many other places, saw more than his

              played the great game they were engaged in falsely, so as <hi rend="italic">to
                sacrifice Antony's fame to that of his enemy.</hi> The playing false to the
              adversary's <hi rend="italic">trump card</hi> (as Warburton explains the words)
              conveys no distinct idea. The plain sense of the passage will appear from the
              following dialogue in Florio's <hi rend="italic">Second Frvtes,</hi> 1591:
              &lsquo;S. What a shooffling doo you keepe with those cardes? A. <hi rend="italic"

              To play false to your opponents trump can do no harm to anybody but the player and his

              &lsquo;stacked&rsquo; the cards in C&aelig;sar's favour, and then, by her
              cheating, converted my glory into an enemy's triumph. Warburton's note renders

              metaphorically, as some have suppos'd, but literally; for that he had no sword of his
              own, appears by what he says to Eros [line 94], and he afterwards dies by his sword:
              nor is it any objection, that this sword is call'd by Dercetas Antony's sword [V, i,
              30]; who only gives it that name as knowing 'twas the sword that he dy'd by, and
              look'd no farther. Cleopatra's action proceeded from tenderness: she saw the rage he
              was in; and, fearing the effects of it, withdrew (or caus'd to be withdrawn), the
              instrument of his harm.&mdash;[If there were any special meaning in asking Eros to
              use his own sword, it may have been that there was therein less thought of suicide.
              Later on Anthony asks Diomed also to draw his sword and give sufficing strokes for
              death; possibly, in this case, because the sword of Eros was still in the wound.

                rend="italic">Blackwood,</hi> Oct. 1853, p. 468): Johnson's note on this place is
              remarkable as an instance of want of judgement in a man whose sagacity was very rarely
              at fault. [Johnson is then quoted.] No interpretation could well go wider of the mark
              than this. Steevens says that she speaks with an &lsquo;affected
              levity.&rsquo; It would be truer to say that she speaks from that bitterness of
              heart which frequently finds a vent for itself in irony. . . . Even although authority
              could be found for [<hi rend="italic">port</hi> used for a <hi rend="italic">load</hi>
              or <hi rend="italic">weight,</hi> Collier's] proposed reading would still be utterly
              indefensible,&mdash;&lsquo;Here's <hi rend="italic">port</hi> (i. e. <hi

              so piteous in the contrast it implies between the fallen queen's present occupation
              and the diversions of her happier times, is quite lost on Collier's unsusceptible
              commentator, who coolly reads, &lsquo;Here's <hi rend="italic">port</hi>
                indeed&rsquo;!&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi>: Some editors have
              stumbled rather strangely at this use of &lsquo;sport&rsquo;; just as if it
              were not a common and a natural thing for people to express the intensest feeling by
              words of a contrary meaning.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Leo</hi> (p. 143) compares
              these words with Cleopatra's dreamings in the old days when her bended hook pierced
              the fishes' slimy jaws, and, as she drew them up, she would &lsquo;think them
              every one an Anthony, and say ah, ha! you're caught.&rsquo;&mdash;II, v, 19.
              &lsquo;And now&rsquo; says Leo, &lsquo;in this cruel hour, those fair,
              bright days recur to her memory, and it flashes on her that she is now, indeed,
              drawing up Anthony's very self, and in bitter, woeful jest, she says to Charmian,
              &lsquo;Here's sport indeed!&rsquo; Leo, with his unflinching honesty,
              acknowledges that he derived the first hint of this from Malone, but we know that it
              was only a hint. In conformity with his interpretation, Leo translates
              &lsquo;Here's sport indeed!&rsquo; by &lsquo;Nun angl' ich
              wieder!&rsquo;&mdash;[It would be temerarious, indeed, to assert that Leo is
              wrong. We all know how frequent in Shakespeare are these subtle, fleeting allusions;
              but for myself I doubt that Cleopatra is thinking of any particular occasion, and
              agree with Staunton that in this piteous cry of irony and of agony, we hear that all
              her laughter-loving life is come but to this.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]

                It,</hi> supposed that Fortune's wheel was a spinning-wheel. Possibly, in popular
              belief it was so, owing to some confusion with Clotho's distaff. Fluellen, however,
              had a perfectly correct idea of it. &lsquo;Fortune,&rsquo; he says,
              &lsquo;is painted also with a wheel to signify to you . . . that she is turning,
              and inconstant, and mutability, and variation; and her foot, look you, is fixed upon a

              of revolution, it is hard to say. Both are found in early Etruscan times. Possibly,
              the wheel was merely an added emblem or badge of the tribe of Leucomones. See Creuzer,

              <hi rend="smallcap">Warburton</hi>: Cleopatra is fallen into a swoon; her maids
              endeavour to recover her by invoking her by her several titles. At length, Charmian
              says to the other, &lsquo;Peace, peace, Iras&rsquo;; on which Cleopatra comes
              to herself, and replies to these last words, &lsquo;No, you are mistaken, I am a
              mere woman like yourself.&rsquo; Thus stands this senseless dialogue. But
              Shakespeare never wrote it so. We must observe then, that the two women call her by
              her several titles, to see which best pleased her; and this was highly in character;
              the Ancients thought, that not only men, but Gods too, had some names which, above
              others, they much delighted in, and would soonest answer to; as we may see by the
              hymns of Orpheus, Homer, and Callimachus. The Poet, conforming to this notion, makes
              the maids say, Sovereign Lady, Madam, Royal Egypt, Empress. And now we come to the
              place in question: Charmian, when she saw that none of these titles had their effect,
              invokes her by a still more flattering one: &lsquo;Peace, peace, <hi
                rend="smallcap">Isis</hi>!&rsquo; for so it should be read and pointed: <hi
                rend="italic">i. e.</hi> peace, we can never move her by these titles: Let us give
              her her favourite name of the Goddess <hi rend="smallcap">Isis</hi>. And now
              Cleopatra's answer becomes pertinent and fine: &lsquo;No more but a mere

              meanest of my species. Here the Poet has followed history exactly, and what is more,
              his author Plutarch, who says, that Cleopatra assumed the habit and attributes of that
              Goddess, and gave judgements, or rather oracles to her people under the quality of the

              <hi rend="smallcap">Theobald</hi> (ed. ii): Menas and Menecrates, we may remember,
              were two famous pirates, linked with Sextus Pompeius, and who assisted him to infest
              the Italian coast. We nowhere learn expressly, in the play, that Menas ever attached
              himself to Octavius's party. Notwithstanding, the Ff concur in marking the entrance
              thus, yet, in the two places in the scene, where this character speaks, they have
              marked in the margin, <hi rend="italic">Mec.,</hi> so that, as Dr Thirlby [<hi
                rend="italic">Nichols, Illust.</hi> ii, 228] sagaciously conjectured, we must

                <hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Variorum</hi> of 1778):
              &lsquo;He mocks the pauses that he makes&rsquo; means that he plays wantonly
              with the intervals of time which he should improve to his own preservation. Or the
              meaning may be,&mdash;being thus defeated in all his efforts, and left without
              resource, tell him that these affected pauses and delays of his in yielding himself up
              to me, are mere idle mockery. &lsquo;He mocks the pauses&rsquo; may be a
              licentious mode </p>
            <p>of expression for,&mdash;<hi rend="italic">he makes a mockery of us by these
                pauses; i. e.</hi> he trifles with us. &mdash;In the <hi rend="italic"
              >Variorum</hi> of 1785, <hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi> expressed the belief that the
              defect in metre proved that some words had been omitted which would have rendered the
              line intelligible. &lsquo;When Antony himself made these pauses, would he
              mock,&rsquo; Malone asks, &lsquo;or laugh at them? and what is the meaning of
                <hi rend="italic">mocking a pause?</hi>&rsquo; He therefore conjectured that <hi
                rend="italic">us by</hi> were the omitted words, and in his own later edition, in
              1790, thus prints the line: &lsquo;Being so frustrate, tell him, he mocks <hi
                rend="italic">us by</hi> The pauses,&rsquo; etc. In this same edition of 1790
              Malone rather disingenuously conveys the impression that the note by Steevens (quoted
              above), had been written after the line had been rendered intelligible by the
              emendation <hi rend="italic">us by.</hi> I have, therefore, dated Steevens's note to
              show that it was written before Malone had, in his own estimation, amended the line.
              In Steevens's edition of 1793 appeared the following additional note by
              him:&mdash;I have left Malone's emendation in the text; though, to complete the
              measure, we might read,&mdash;&lsquo;frustrate<hi rend="italic"
              >d,</hi>&rsquo; or &lsquo;Being so frustrate, tell him <hi rend="italic"
              >that</hi> he mocks,&rsquo; etc.; as I am well convinced we are not yet acquainted
              with the full and exact meaning of the verb <hi rend="italic">mock,</hi> as sometimes
              employed by Shakespeare. [From <hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> (ed. ii) we learn that
              this change, suggested by Steevens, &lsquo;tell him <hi rend="italic"
              >that,</hi>&rsquo; is also given by the MS. Collier thereupon remarks]: The
              expression <hi rend="italic">to mock pauses</hi> is far from intelligible; and it
              seems pretty certain that the old printer made some confusion between
              &lsquo;mocks&rsquo; and <hi rend="italic">makes,</hi> words so much alike in
              old MSS. Malone added <hi rend="italic">us by,</hi> and they appear necessary in order
              to render the sense clear; at all events that object has been obtained, and the
              regularity of the verse preserved.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ritson</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Cursory Crit.</hi> p. 88): The two last words [&lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">us by</hi>&rsquo;] of this line are added by the present Irish
              editor, who observes that &lsquo;the defect of the metre,&rsquo; of which he
              knows as much as a superannuated jack-ass, &lsquo;shows that something was
              omitted.&rsquo; Former editors [see <hi rend="italic">Text. Notes</hi>] supplied
              the measure by reading, &lsquo;Being so frustrat<hi rend="italic">ed,</hi> tell
              him he mocks&rsquo;; which, it must be confessed, does not afford an easy sense.
              Shakespeare, however, would never have written the above hobbling line [Malone's]
              which has no sort of pretensions to metre. We may read, &lsquo;Being so
              frustrated, he mocks us by.&rsquo;&mdash;[<hi rend="smallcap">Knight</hi>
              reluctantly approves of Malone's emendation, and prints it in brackets in his text.
                <hi rend="smallcap">R. G. White</hi> (ed. i) approves but does not adopt. <hi
                rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi> approves heartily and adopts, and does &lsquo;not
              see how it is possible to strain any sense at all out of the original
              reading.&rsquo; For my part, I think Steevens supplies us with a sense when he
              says, in effect, that Anthony's pauses, now that he is utterly vanquished, are a
                mockery.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>

              Shakespeare seems to mean that the death of so great a man ought to have produced
              effects similar to those which might have been expected from the dissolution of the
              universe, when all distinctions shall be lost. Perhaps, however, Shakespeare might
              mean nothing more here than merely an earthquake, in which the shaking of the <hi

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Warburton</hi>: The action of suicide is here said to shackle
              accidents; to bolt up change; to be the beggar's nurse and C&aelig;sar's. So far
              the description is intelligible. But when it is said that it sleeps and never palates
              more the dung, we find neither sense nor propriety: which is occasioned by the loss of
              a whole line between the third and fourth, and the corrupt reading of </p>
            <p>the last word in the fourth. We should read the passage thus: &lsquo;And it is
              great To do the thing that ends all other deeds; Which shackles accidents, and bolts
              up change; [<hi rend="italic">Lulls wearied nature to a sound repose;</hi>] Which
              sleeps, and never palates more the <hi rend="italic">dugg:</hi> The beggar's nurse and
              C&aelig;sar's.&rsquo; That this line in hooks was the substance of that lost,
              is evident from its making sense of all the rest: which are to this effect.
              &lsquo;It is great to do that which frees us from all the accidents of humanity,
              lulls our over-wearied nature to repose (which now sleeps and has no more appetite for
              worldly enjoyments), and is equally the nurse of C&aelig;sar and the
                beggar.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Seward</hi> (Note on <hi
                rend="italic">The False One,</hi> IV, ii, p. 139): When we speak in contempt of
              anything, we generally resolve it into its first principles: Thus, man is dust and
              ashes, and the food we eat, the dung, by which first our vegetable, and from thence
              our animal, food is nourished. Thus Cleopatra finding she can no longer riot in the
              pleasures of life, with the usual workings of a disappointed pride, pretends a disgust
              to them, and speaks in praise of suicide [as in the present lines]. From the
              observations above, nothing can be clearer than this passage: &lsquo;both the
              beggar and C&aelig;sar are fed and nursed by the dung of the earth.&rsquo; Of
              this sense there is a demonstration in [I, i, 48].&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Heath</hi> (p. 466): That is, which sleeps, and hath no further relish for the trash
              and dung of this earth, which dung is equally necessary to the support of
              C&aelig;sar, as of the meanest beggar. In what sense Warburton could understand
              death to be equally the nurse of C&aelig;sar and the beggar, or indeed to be the
              nurse of either, is inconceivable.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Capell</hi> (i, 49):
              The sentiment in line 8 is not unlike one in I, i, 48, and the expressions which that
              is couch'd in, shew plainly what &lsquo;dung&rsquo; means in this line,
              viz.&mdash;the earth, and it's <hi rend="italic">dungy</hi> productions; and to
              mark her contempt of them, and of C&aelig;sar too at the same time, she calls
              them&mdash;the nourses or nourishers both of him and the beggar.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Johnson</hi>: The difficulty of the passage, if any difficulty there
              be, arises only from this, that the act of suicide, and the state which is the effect
              of suicide, are confounded. Voluntary death, says she, is an act <hi rend="italic"
                >which bolts up change;</hi> it produces a state, &lsquo;Which sleeps, and never
              palates more the dung, The beggar's nurse and C&aelig;sar's.&rsquo; Which has
              no longer need of the gross and terrene sustenance, in the use of which
              C&aelig;sar and the beggar are on a level. The speech is abrupt, but perturbation
              in such a state is surely natural.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Boswell</hi>:
              &lsquo;The beggar's nurse and C&aelig;sar's&rsquo; means, I apprehend,
              &lsquo;death&rsquo; (as Warburton has observed), and not, as Johnson supposed,
              the gross substance on which C&aelig;sar and the beggar were fed.&mdash;[<hi
                rend="smallcap">Knight</hi> agrees with Boswell that the &lsquo;beggar's nurse
              is, unquestionably, </p>
            <p>death.&rsquo;]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> (ed. ii): This [<hi
                rend="italic">dug</hi>] is an admirable, though merely literal emendation in the MS.
              What Cleopatra says is, that self-destruction prevents all change, and no longer
              requires, or &lsquo;palates&rsquo; the <hi rend="italic">dug,</hi> which
              affords nutriment to all mankind, whether high or low.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Dyce</hi> (ed. ii): To me the word &lsquo;nurse&rsquo; is almost alone
              sufficient evidence that &lsquo;dung&rsquo; is a transcriber's or printer's
              mistake for <hi rend="italic">dug,</hi>&mdash; which was the more liable to be
              corrupted, as it was formerly often spelt <hi rend="italic">dugge</hi> (so the folio
              has, in <hi rend="italic">Rom. &amp; Jul.</hi> I, iii, &lsquo;on the nipple of
              my <hi rend="italic">Dugge</hi>&rsquo;). The sense I conceive to be,
              &lsquo;and never more palates that dug which affords nourishment as well to the
              beggar as to C&aelig;sar.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Anon.</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Blackwood,</hi> Oct. 1853, p. 469): The sense probably is,
              &mdash;&lsquo;It is great to do the thing (suicide) which causes us to sleep,
              and never more to taste the produce of the earth, which nourishes alike
              C&aelig;sar and the beggar. The MS correction [Warburton's] certainly does not
              mend matters. This reading affords no extrication of the construction,
              &lsquo;which sleeps,&rsquo; which we have ventured to explain as
              &lsquo;which <hi rend="italic">lays us</hi> asleep, and <hi rend="italic">causes

                change.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Staunton</hi>: &lsquo;Dung&rsquo; for

              appears to be used here for <hi rend="italic">nourishment.</hi> Cleopatra is speaking
              contemptuously of this life, as if anything that depends upon such coarse, vulgar
              feeding were not worth keeping. But Cleopatra has never <hi rend="italic">palated</hi>
              the <hi rend="italic">dug</hi> since she was a baby; and the sense of the passage
              clearly requires some contemptuous word for the <hi rend="italic">common</hi> supports

              . . . There seems a considerable difference between speaking of the earth as

              fruits of the fertilizing earth, used, certainly in a spirit of bitter mockery and
              supreme contempt.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Thiselton</hi> (p. 25): A reminiscence
              of Anthony's words in I, i, 48. Nowhere are such reminiscences used with more effect
              than in the close of this tragedy where they suggest the integrity of Cleopatra's
              attachment to Anthony. Shakespeare meant us to leave Cleopatra, notwithstanding her
              failings, with feelings of sympathy and admiration, and that our last thoughts should
              be of &lsquo;the glory of her womanhood.&rsquo;&mdash;[There is a strength
              in the very coarseness of the word &lsquo;dung&rsquo; which, to me, strongly
              commends it. Only a poet, strong in his own strength, and conscious of his own
              supremacy, and &lsquo;nearness to the eternal verities,&rsquo; would have
              dared to use it. This elemental vigour is, to me, wholly lacking in Warburton's
              substitution. Surely it does not need either natural death or suicide to cause us to
              cease from palating the dug. The palating of it ceases with weaning. It is while we
              palate it, before we are weaned, that an aversion to it can be created. When we cease
              to have any love for it, death can then produce no aversion. In order, therefore, to
              change love for the dug into indifference to it, should not suicide be restricted to
              babes at the breast?&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              appeache him, as though he were a cruell and mercilesse man, that were not to be
              trusted. So euen as he spake the word, he tooke her dagger from her, and shooke her

              neither know nor care. Nor does any one in the audience ever know how they entered,

              however, attributed this distribution to the two latter editors, and remarks: This
              blunder was for want of knowing, or observing, the historical fact. When
              C&aelig;sar sent Proculeius to the queen, he sent Gallus after him with new
              instructions; and while one amused Cleopatra with propositions from C&aelig;sar,
              through the crannies of the monument, the other scaled it by a ladder, entered it at a
              window backward, and made Cleopatra, and those with her, prisoners. I have reformed
              the passage, therefore (as, I am persuaded, the author designed it), from the
              authority of Plutarch.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Johnson</hi>: This line, in the
              first edition, is given to Proculeius; and to him it certainly belongs, though perhaps
              misplaced. I would put it at the end of his foregoing speech: &lsquo;Where he for
              grace is kneel'd to. <hi rend="italic">Aside to Gallus.</hi> You see how easily she
              may be surpriz'd&rsquo;; Then, while Cleopatra makes a formal answer, Gallus, upon
              the hint given, seizes her, and Proculeius, interrupting the civility of his answer:
              &lsquo;&mdash;your plight is pitied Of him that caus'd it,&rsquo; cries
              out: &lsquo;Guard her till C&aelig;sar come.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: It is clear, from the passage quoted from Plutarch in
              the preceding note, that this [&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Pro.</hi>&rsquo;] was
              an error of the compositor's at the press, and that it belongs to Gallus; who, </p>
            <p>after Proculeius hath, according to his suggestion, ascended the monument, goes out
              to inform C&aelig;sar that Cleopatra is taken. That C&aelig;sar was informed
              immediately of Cleopatra's being taken, appears from Dolabella's first speech to
              Proculeius on his entry: &lsquo;Proculeius, What thou hast done, thy master
              C&aelig;sar knows,&rsquo; etc. [See lines 77, 78.] This information, it is to
              be presumed, C&aelig;sar obtained from Gallus. The stage-directions being very
              imperfect in this scene in the old copy, no <hi rend="italic">exit</hi> is here
              marked; but as Gallus afterwards enters along with C&aelig;sar, it was undoubtedly
              the author's intention that he should here go out.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Walker</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Crit.</hi> ii, 177) has an Article on
              &lsquo;Instances in which Speeches are assigned in the Folio to Wrong
              Characters,&rsquo; in the course of which he remarks (p. 185) that,
              &lsquo;Errors in the assignment of speeches, &mdash;including cases in which
              two speeches have been confused into one, or the like,&mdash; are remarkably
              frequent in the Folio. I have just cited sixty or more instances [sixtysix, by my
                counting.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] in which this has taken place,
              even according to the universally received text. This being the case, there is no
              reason why we should be scrupulous in asserting the same of other passages, where the
              context clearly indicates it. [The present line is among the sixty-six.]&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Thiselton</hi> (p. 26): If it were desired to follow Plutarch, the
              simplest way would be, perhaps, to regard this line as the commencement of a new scene
              the interval being taken up with the movements of Proculeius, but the fact that
              Gallus, whose presence talking with Cleopatra is essential to Plutarch's account, does
              not enter till later shows that Shakespeare did not intend to follow his authority
              slavishly. It therefore seems preferable to suppose that the ladder was fixed by the
              soldiers during Proculeius&rsquo; previous conversation with Cleopatra, and that
              he, instead of going to C&aelig;sar as he pretended, climbed up the ladder with
              the soldiers and almost immediately appeared behind Cleopatra and her companions who
              were still standing at the gate. This view will account for the two speeches in
              succession being attributed to Proculeius by the Folio. </p>

              a very easy change, to restore an exquisite fine allusion; which carries its reason
              with it too, why there was no <hi rend="italic">winter</hi> in his bounty:
              &lsquo;For his bounty, There was no <hi rend="italic">winter</hi> in't; an <hi
                rend="italic">autumn</hi> 'twas, That grew the more by reaping.&rsquo; I ought
              to take notice, that the ingenious Dr Thirlby likewise started this very emendation,
              and had marked it in the margin of his book. The reason of the depravation might
              easily arise from the great similitude of the two words in the old spelling, <hi
                rend="italic">Antonie</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Automne.</hi> [The name is spelt
                <hi rend="italic">Anthony</hi> in this play in the Folio without an exception, I

                little.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] Our author has employed this thought
              again in [his 53rd <hi rend="italic">Sonnet</hi>]: &lsquo;Speak of the spring and
              foison of the year; The one doth shadow of your beauty show, The other as your bounty
              doth appear; And you in every blessed shape we know.&rsquo; 'Tis plain that
              &lsquo;foison&rsquo; means <hi rend="italic">Autumn</hi> here, which pours out
              its profusion of fruits bountifully; in opposition to <hi rend="italic">Spring,</hi>
              which only shews the youthful beauty, and promise of that future bounty.&mdash;
                <hi rend="smallcap">Corson</hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Nation,</hi> 28 Aug., 1873):
              If &lsquo;An Anthony it was&rsquo; is not right, &lsquo;an autumn
              'twas&rsquo; is certainly wrong. It is too tame for the intensely impassioned
              speech in which it occurs, or, rather, into which it has been introduced by the
              editors. Again, if &lsquo;autumn&rsquo; could, by metonymy, be wrenched to
              mean the crops of autumn, it could hardly be said that an autumn <hi rend="italic"
                >grows</hi> the more by reaping. But this reading of Theobald has been silently
              adopted by all subsequent editors, without any consideration of its tameness or of the
              resultant incongruity. In &lsquo;An <hi rend="italic">Anthony</hi> it
              was,&rsquo; &lsquo;it&rsquo; stands, of course, for
              &lsquo;Bounty.&rsquo; His Bounty was an <hi rend="italic">Anthony,</hi>
              &lsquo;that grew the more by reaping.&rsquo; Now, could the &lsquo;less
              Greek&rsquo; which, Ben Jonson tells us, Shakespeare possessed, have enabled him
              to see in &lsquo;Anthony&rsquo; the word <foreign lang="greek"
              >a)\nqos?</foreign> His Bounty had no winter in it; it was a mead of perennial
              luxuriance, affording a </p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">flowering</hi> pasturage (<foreign lang="greek"
              >*a)nqo/nomos</foreign>), and &lsquo;that grew the more by
                reaping.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">James Spedding</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">N. &amp; Qu.,</hi> 1874, V, i, 303): I cannot understand Prof.
              Corson's objection to &lsquo;autumn.&rsquo; In the cursive black-letter hand
              of the time <hi rend="italic">Autumn</hi> might easily be written so as to be hardly
              distinguishable from <hi rend="italic">Antonie,</hi> and surely it makes better sense
              and better poetry. So far from calling it &lsquo;tame,&rsquo; I should
              instance it as one of the noblest, boldest, and liveliest images in poetry. Keats said
              that poetry &lsquo;ought to surprise, by a fine excess.&rsquo; This is exactly
              a case of such &lsquo;fine excess.&rsquo; &lsquo;An autumn that grew the
              more by reaping&rsquo;&mdash;that, the more you took of its harvests, the more
              there remained to take&mdash;is surely as great an image of
              &lsquo;bounty&rsquo; as the mind in its most impassioned state ever created;
              quite as much so, and yet evidently from the same mint, as
              Juliet's&mdash;&lsquo;My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep;
              the more I give to thee, The more I have; for both are infinite.&rsquo; As for the
              difficulty of understanding by autumn the crops of autumn, how is it more difficult
              than to understand by &lsquo;winter&rsquo; the absence of crops? And what are
              we to come to? Instead of allowing Tennyson to say&mdash;&lsquo;To strip a
              hundred hollows bare of spring,&rsquo; we shall have to ask him to print
              &lsquo;sprigs&rsquo; for &lsquo;spring.&rsquo; As for the amount of
              Shakespeare's Greek, of which he has left us no means of judging, the difficulty is to
              understand how he could have had Greek enough to know that <foreign lang="greek"
                >a)\nqos</foreign> meant a flower, without knowing also that Anthony could <hi
                rend="italic">not</hi> mean a pasture of flowers; and not only could not really mean
              it, but could not, by any process of association, legitimate or illegitimate, suggest
              the image to an Englishman.&mdash;[Theobald asks, &lsquo;how an Antony could
              grow the more by reaping?&rsquo; Would it not be equally pertinent to ask how an
              autumn could grow the more by reaping? Reaping in the autumn is done when the grain is
              ripe, and grain thus reaped never grows again. The farmer is not yet born who, in the
              temperate zone, reaps the ripe grain in the autumn and finds it growing more
              vigorously for the process. To be sure, a farmer who could keep on reaping stubble
              fields and find at each reaping a heavier harvest would be, as Spedding observes,
              &lsquo;as great an image of &ldquo;bounty&rdquo; as the mind in its most
              impassioned state ever created,&rsquo; and, possibly, can be paralleled only in
              the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights.</hi> Not thus essentially at fault are, I think,
              Shakespeare's similes, which may be sometimes flagrantly open to criticism, but never
              to downright folly&mdash; thus, in all humility, it seems to me. When Spedding
              becomes eloquent over the beauty of &lsquo;autumn,&rsquo; he seems to forget
              that he is exalting not Shakespeare, but Theobald. There is about Corson's suggestion
              so much refinement, elegance, and charm that it is hard to reject it. But,
              unfortunately, there is nothing in common between Anthony and Anthos but the first
              syllable, and there is no Greek word which will furnish any more. Moreover, we do not
              reap flowers, even to make them grow. Until an emendation is suggested, therefore,
              happier, as I think, than <hi rend="italic">autumn,</hi> I shall endeavour, for my own
              feeble self, to extract from &lsquo;Anthony&rsquo; what meaning I may of
              inexhaustible perfection in face, in form, in voice, in bounty, which for Cleopatra so
              far lay in that single name that once, in order to express the height and depth and
              boundlessness of her self-absorption she exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh, my oblivion is a

              deportment toward the Emperor from the moment of his sending Thyreus to her displays
              the keenest shrewdness. In this respect, her interview with him is a model. . . . From
              the very instant that she learned the Emperor's decision to carry her as a prisoner to
              Rome to grace his triumph, her resolve to take her own life was fixed and immovable.

              merit of our ministers' good actions, as well as bear the blame of their
              bad.&rsquo; But she softens the word <hi rend="italic">merit</hi> into <hi
                rend="italic">pity.</hi> The reason of her making the reflexion was this: Her former
              conduct was liable to much censure from Octavius, which she would hereby artfully
              insinuate was owing to her evil ministers. And as her present conduct, in concealing
              her treasures, appeared to be her own act, she being detected by her minister, she
              begs, that as she now answers for her former minister's miscarriages, so her present
              minister's merit in this discovery, might likewise be placed to her account: Which she

              the actions of other people.&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Merit</hi> is here used, as
              the word <hi rend="italic">desert</hi> frequently is, to express a certain degree of
              merit or demerit. A man may merit punishment as well as reward.&mdash;<hi

              Capell's crabbed English (Dr Johnson, using Prospero's language in reference to

              other interpretations, and, in addition, his version conforms closely to the Folio.
              The real difficulty lies, as he says, in the word &lsquo;name,&rsquo; which

              <hi rend="smallcap">Theobald</hi>: Freinshemius has observed, upon a passage in

              express. Our author observes this conduct here. Cleopatra must be supposed to mean,
              she has spoke for the asp, and it is provided, tho' she says not a word of it in
              direct terms.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Capell</hi> (i, 51): The Poet's art in
              this place is worth noting: &lsquo;it&rsquo; relates covertly to the asp which
              she afterwards dies by; but her further directions about it, are convey'd in a

              (ii, 152): But though Cleopatra talks of dying &lsquo;after the high Roman
              fashion,&rsquo; she fears what she most desires, and cannot perform with
              simplicity what costs her such an effort. That extreme physical cowardice, which was
              so strong a trait in her historical character, which led to the defeat of Actium,
              which made her delay the execution of a fatal resolve till she had &lsquo;tried
              conclusions infinite of <hi rend="italic">easy</hi> ways to die,&rsquo;
              Shakespeare has rendered with the finest possible effect, and in a manner which
              heightens instead of diminishing our respect and interest. Timid by nature, she is
              courageous by the mere force of will, and she lashes herself up with high-sounding
              words into a kind of false daring. Her lively imagination suggests every incentive
              which can spur her on to the deed she has resolved, yet trembles to contemplate. She
              pictures to herself all the degradations which must attend her captivity; and let it
              be observed, that those which she anticipates are precisely such as a vain, luxurious,
              and haughty woman would especially dread, and which only true virtue and magnanimity
              could despise. Cleopatra could have endured the loss of freedom; but to be led in
              triumph through the streets of Rome is insufferable. She could stoop to
              C&aelig;sar with dissembling courtesy, and meet duplicity with superior art; but

              die &lsquo;ph&oelig;nix like,&rsquo; as she had lived, with all the pomp
              of preparation&mdash;luxurious in her despair. The death of Lucretia, of Portia,
              of Arria, and others who died &lsquo;after the high Roman fashion,&rsquo; is
              sublime according to the Pagan ideas of virtue, and yet none of them so powerfully
              affect the imagination as the catastrophe of Cleopatra. The idea of this frail, timid,
              wayward woman, dying with heroism from the mere force of passion and will, takes us by
              surprise. The attic elegance of her mind, her poetical imagination, the pride of
              beauty and royalty predominating to the last, and the sumptuous and picturesque
              accompaniments with which she surrounds herself in death, carry to its extreme height
              that effect of contrast which prevails through her life and character. No arts, no
              invention could add to the real circumstances of Cleopatra's closing scene.
              Shakespeare has shown profound judgment and feeling in adhering closely to the
              classical authorities; and to say that the language and sentiments worthily fill up
              the outline, is the most magnificent praise that can be given. </p>

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">A. C. Bradley</hi> (p. 395): The Porter [in <hi rend="italic"
                >Macbeth</hi>] does not make me smile: the moment is too terrific. He is grotesque;
              no doubt the contrast he affords is humorous as well as ghastly; I dare say the
              groundlings roared with laughter at his coarsest remarks. But they are not comic
              enough to allow one to forget for a moment what has preceded and what must follow. And
              I am far from complaining of this. I believe that it is what Shakespeare intended, and
              that he despised the groundlings if they laughed. Of course he could have written
              without the least difficulty speeches five times as humorous; but he knew better. The
              Grave-diggers make us laugh: the old Countryman who brings the asps to Cleopatra makes
              us smile at least. But the Grave-digger scene does not come at a moment of extreme
              tension; and it is long. Our distress for Ophelia is not so absorbing that we refuse
              to be interested in the man who digs her grave, or even continue throughout the long
              conversation to remember always with pain that the grave is hers. It is fitting,
              therefore, that he should be made decidedly humorous. The passage in <hi rend="italic"
                >Antony and Cleopatra</hi> is much nearer to the passage in <hi rend="italic"
                >Macbeth,</hi> and seems to have been forgotten by those who say that there is
              nothing in Shakespeare resembling that passage.<hi rend="sup">*</hi> The old
              Countryman comes at a moment of tragic exaltation, and the dialogue is appropriately
              brief. But the moment, though tragic, is emphatically one of exaltation. We have not
              been feeling horror, nor are we feeling a dreadful suspense. We are going to see
              Cleopatra die, but she is to die gloriously and to triumph over Octavius. And
              therefore our amusement at the old Countryman and the contrast he affords to these
              high passions, is untroubled, and it was right to make him really comic. But the
              Porter's case is quite different. We cannot forget how the knocking that makes him
              grumble sounded to Macbeth, or that within a few minutes of his opening the gate
              Duncan will be discovered in his blood; nor can we help feeling that in pretending to
              be porter of hell-gate he is terribly near the truth. To give him language so humorous
              that it would ask us almost to lose the sense of these things would have been a fatal
              mistake,&mdash;the kind of mistake that means want of dramatic imagination. And
              that was not the sort of error into which Shakespeare fell. <note anchored="yes">*
                Even if this were true, the retort is obvious that neither is there anything

              down the basket, or in leaning over it to take her farewell, gets a bite from an asp;
              and being it's first bite, when it's poison was most vigorous, she dies almost
              instantly: The exulting and </p>
            <p>triumphing manner that Cleopatra goes off in, shews the flow of her spirits, and her
              death is partly lengthen'd by that; partly, as we may conjecture, by her taking the
              weaken'd asp first to apply to her breast; when the fresh one is apply'd to her arm,
              she vanishes as her woman had done: The poison of both being weaken'd, Charmian's
              death is protracted of course: and if we further suppose her to have taken by accident
              the aspick that her partner had dy'd by, this will account for her words&mdash;

                Iras,</hi> in order to see the effect of the poison, and the pain she had to
              encounter in death. The asp might be applied to Iras, either with or without her
              consent. This opinion is strengthened by Cleopatra saying, &ldquo;This calls me
              base,&rdquo; as it could not be base in Cleopatra, that Iras did it without her
              consent; but the baseness must be in her own want of resolution, and in the murder of
              Iras. When Cleopatra says, &ldquo;Come thou mortal wretch,&rdquo; I should
              suppose that Cleopatra then applied the first asp to her own
              breast.&rsquo;&mdash;The <hi rend="smallcap">Cowden-Clarkes</hi>: Throughout
              this scene, Iras has shown eagerness for death; witness her

              the dark&rsquo;; and &lsquo;I'll never see it; I am sure my nails are stronger

              assumption finds no support whatever in the text. Shakespeare wished to make it clear

              following address to the asp: &lsquo;Better than death death's office thou
              dischargest, That with one gentle touch can free our breath; And in a pleasing sleep
              our soul enlargest, Making ourselves not privy to our death. Therefore come thou, of

              the 51st Book of his <hi rend="italic">Roman History</hi> is express as to small
              punctures of the asp being discover'd only on her arm. And Plutarch [verifies it.]
              Strabo, Vel</p>
            <p>leius Paterculus, Eutropius, and Lucius Florus leave this matter as much at large.
              Leonardo Augustini, among his antique gems, exhibits one of Cleopatra upon an agot,
              with an aspick biting her right breast. And Strada, the Mantuan Antiquary, who gives
              us a medal of this princess, says, that she died by serpents applied to her breasts.

                >Cleopatra</hi> with two Asps or venemous Serpents unto her arms, or breasts, or
              both, requires consideration: for therein (beside that this variety is not excusable)
              the thing it self is questionable; nor is it indisputably certain what manner of death
              she died. <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi rend="italic">Antony</hi>
              plainly delivereth, that no man knew the manner of her death; for some affirmed she
              perished by poison, which she always carried in a little hollow comb, and wore it in
              her hair. Beside, there were never any Asps discovered in the place of her death,
              although two of her Maids perished also with her; only it was said, two small and
              almost insensible pricks were found upon her arm; which was all the ground that <hi
                rend="italic">C&aelig;sar</hi> had to presume the manner of her death. <hi
                rend="italic">Galen</hi> who was contemporary unto <hi rend="italic">Plutarch,</hi>
              delivereth two wayes of her death: that she killed her self by the bite of an Asp, or
              bit an hole in her arm, and poured poison therein. <hi rend="italic">Strabo</hi> that
              lived before them both hath also two opinions; that she died by the bite of an Asp, or
              else a poisonous ointment. We might question the length of the Asps, which are
              sometimes described exceeding short; whereas the Chers&aelig;a or land-Asp which
              most conceive she used, is above four cubits long. Their number is not unquestionable;
              for whereas there are generally two described, <hi rend="italic">Augustus</hi> (as <hi
                rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> relateth) did carry in his triumph the Image of <hi
                rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> but with one Asp unto her arm. As for the two pricks,
              or little spots in her arm, they infer not their plurality: for like the Viper, the
              Asp hath two teeth; whereby it left this impression, or double puncture behind it. And
              lastly, We might question the place; for some apply them unto her breast, which
              notwithstanding will not consist with the History; and <hi rend="italic">Petrus
                Victorius</hi> hath well observed the same. But herein the mistake was easie; it
              being the custom in capital malefactors to apply them unto the breast, as the Author

              quoted Steevens's note on line 374. In his second edition he added an extract from
              North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> wherein Charmian is described as trimming the
              diadem which Cleopatra wore upon her head; he then concluded as follows:
              &lsquo;The addition I have now made to my original note on this passage has been
              called forth by the thrice-foolish attempt to defend the blunder of the Folio,
              &lsquo;away,&rsquo; [in the foregoing note by James
              Nichols].&rsquo;&mdash;[Surely, no one, after reading Nichols's note, will
              approve of Dyce's intemperate words. For myself, I think the note, in its praiseworthy
              attempt to vindicate the Folio, is eminently just, and am ready to share any
              condemnation which may properly fall on its writer. In itself, the phrase
              &lsquo;your crown's away&rsquo; is more smooth and liquid than the crooked,
              harsh &lsquo;your crown's <hi rend="italic">awry.</hi>&rsquo; The sole
              objection to &lsquo;away&rsquo; that I can perceive (and it is trivial) is the
              rhyme with &lsquo;play,&rsquo; in the next line; but the words can be so
              spoken that the rhyme will be unnoticeable. Dyce's baptismal name was well bestowed;
              he considered Shakespeare as his exclusive realm, and in this realm, &lsquo;Like
              Alexander he would reign, And he would reign alone,&rsquo;&mdash;woe to any
              one who ventured a foothold there! Collier always believed that Dyce's bitter and
              inappeasible hostility dated from the discovery that he was preparing an edition of
              Shakespeare. A. E. Brae, an unusually keen critic, was another of Dyce's aversions.
              Brae was, by profession, a dentist; therefore, presumably, Dyce felt less compunction
              in attacking him, certainly tooth, and possibly nail. Ingleby, too, received one of
              Dyce's bitterest strokes. Lettsom appears to have been the only exception in Dyce's
              horizon, and to him Dyce paid homage throughout his second edition. The emendation
              &lsquo;awry,&rsquo; be it observed, is Rowe's, not Pope's, to whom it is
              almost universally attributed. <hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi> quotes the
              corresponding passage in Daniels' <hi rend="italic">Tragedie of Cleopatra,</hi>

              believe that the disregard of this long dash after &lsquo;play,&rsquo; in the

              therefore, all the more observed. In proof of its rarity, see line 378, where it
              should be, but is not. After line 368, above, it has been by all editors punctiliously

              <hi rend="smallcap">Hunter</hi> (ii, 290): This passage is left without any
              annotation, and yet there is meaning in it which many readers might not discover.
              Dollabella had alluded to the augurs. This introduces the idea of the flight of birds;
              this the idea of hawking; and Cleopatra, brave in her death, is represented under the
              image of a hawk levelling at the purposes of her conqueror, and rendering them dead or
              ineffectual. The idea of hawking introduced the idea of other field-sports, and to the
              hawk Shakespeare transfers the attribute of a <hi rend="italic">hart-royal,</hi> which
              had the privilege of roaming at large unmolested, and taking its own way to its lair.
              Thus Cleopatra being &lsquo;royal&rsquo; had &lsquo;taken her own
              way&rsquo; in self-destruction. In <hi rend="italic">The Gentleman's
              Recreation,</hi> p. 6, the liberty of the <hi rend="italic">hart-royal</hi> is thus
              described:&mdash;&lsquo;If the King or Queen shall happen to hunt or chase a
              hart, and he escape with life, he shall ever after be called a <hi rend="italic"
                >hart-royal;</hi> but if he fly so far from the forest or chase that it is unlikely
              he will ever return of his own accord to the place aforesaid, and that proclamation be
              made in all towns and villages thereabout, that none shall kill or offend him, but
              that he may safely return, if he list, he is then called a <hi rend="italic">hart
                royal proclaimed.</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Madden</hi> (p. 19):
              The male red deer is now ordinarily called a stag, the female a hind, and the young a
              calf. . . . But if you would speak in the strict language of woodcraft, you would call
              him in the first year &lsquo;a Hind calfe, or a calfe, the second yeere you shall
              call him a Broket; . . . the sixt yeere you shall call him a Hart. . . . But if the
              king or queene doe hunt or chace him, and he escape away aliue, then after such a
              hunting or chacing he is called Hart Royall.&rsquo;&mdash;Manwood, <hi
                rend="italic">The Forest Lawes,</hi> 1598. Thenceforth, after proclamation, he was
              free to return to the forest from whence he came, and no man might meddle with a hart
              royal proclaimed. Hunter suggests [as above] that when C&aelig;sar said of
              Cleopatra that she &lsquo;being royal, Took her own way,&rsquo; the licence
              accorded to the hart royal to go his own way was present to his mind; and certainly
              instances may be found in Shakespeare of similar conceits. The stag, or hart, at six
              years of age should have acquired &lsquo;his rights,&rsquo;&mdash;that is
              to say, the brow, bay, and trey antlers&mdash;and two points on top of each horn.
              The modern use of the term &lsquo;royal&rsquo; to denote a stag with all his
              rights and three on top, is altogether inaccurate, and without warranty of any writer
              of authority on woodcraft. </p>
