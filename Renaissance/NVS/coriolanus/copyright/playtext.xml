<lb/>No publique benefit which you receiue
<lb/>But it proceeds, or comes from them to you,
<lb n="163"/>And no way from your &longs;elues. What do you thinke?

<lb/>1 He had &longs;o, looking as it were, would I were hang'd
<lb/>but I thought there was more in him, then I could think.
<lb/>2 So did I, Ile be &longs;worne: He &verbar; is &longs;imply the rare&longs;t man

<lb n="185"/></p></sp><sp who="cor-6 cor-4"><speaker>Both.</speaker><p> Wherefore? Wherefore?
<lb/>3 Why here's he that was wont to thwacke our Ge-
<lb/>nerall, <stage>Caius Martius.</stage>
<lb/>1 Why do you &longs;ay, thwacke our Generall?
<lb/>3 I do not &longs;ay thwacke our Generall, but he was al-
<lb n="190"/>wayes good enough for him
<lb/>2 Come we are fellowes and friends: he was euer too
<lb/>hard for him, I haue heard him &longs;ay &longs;o him&longs;elfe.
<lb/>1 He was too hard for him directly, to &longs;ay the Troth
<lb/>on't before <hi rend="italic">Corioles,</hi> he &longs;cotcht him, and notcht him like a
<lb n="195"/>Carbinado.
<lb n="196"/>2 And hee had bin Cannibally giuen, hee might haue
<lb/>boyld and eaten him too.
<lb/>1 But more of thy Newes.
<lb/>3 Why he is &longs;o made on heere within, as if hee were
<lb n="200"/>Son and Heire to Mars, &longs;et at vpper end o'th'Table: No
<lb/>que&longs;tion askt him by any of the Senators, but they &longs;tand
<lb/>bald before him. Our Generall him&longs;elfe makes a Mi&longs;tris
<lb/>of him, Sanctifies him&longs;elfe with's hand, and turnes vp the
<lb/>white o'th'eye to his Di&longs;cour&longs;e. But the bottome of the
<lb n="205"/>Newes is, our Generall is cut i'th'middle, &amp; but one halfe
<lb n="206"/>of what he was ye&longs;terdav. For the other ha's halfe, by
<lb/>the intreaty and graunt of the whole Table. Hee'l go he
<lb/>&longs;ayes, and &longs;ole the Porter of Rome Gates by th'eares. He
<lb/>will mowe all downe before him, and leaue his pa&longs;&longs;age
<lb n="210"/>poul'd.
<lb/>2 And he's as like to do't, as any man I can imagine.
<lb/>3 Doo't? he will doo't: for look you &longs;ir, he has as ma-
<lb/>ny Friends as Enemies: which Friends &longs;ir as it were, dur&longs;t
<lb/>not (looke you &longs;ir) &longs;hew them&longs;elues (as we terme it) his
<lb n="215"/>Friends, while&longs;t he's in Directitude.
<lb/>1 Directitude? What's that<hi rend="italic">?</hi>
<lb n="217"/>3 But when they &longs;hall &longs;ee &longs;ir, his Cre&longs;t vp againe, and
<lb/>the man in blood, they will out of their Burroughes (like
<lb n="219"/>Conies after Raine) and reuell all with him.
<lb n="220"/>1 But when goes this forward<hi rend="italic">:</hi>
<lb/>3 To morrow, to day, pre&longs;ently, you &longs;hall haue the
<lb/>Drum &longs;trooke vp this afternoone: 'Tis as it were a parcel
<lb/>of their Fea&longs;t, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.
<lb/>2 Why then wee &longs;hall haue a &longs;tirring World againe:
<lb n="225"/>This peace is nothing, but to ru&longs;t Iron, &verbar;encrea&longs;e Taylors,
<lb/>and breed Ballad-makers.
<lb/>1 Let me haue Warre &longs;ay I, it exceeds peace as farre
<lb n="228"/>as day do's night: It's &longs;prightly walking, audible, and full
<lb n="229"/>of Vent. Peace, is a very Apoplexy, Lethargie, mull'd,
<lb n="230"/>deafe, &longs;leepe, in&longs;ensible, a getter of more ba&longs;tard Chil-
<lb/>dren, then warres a de&longs;troyer of men.
<lb/>2 'Tis &longs;o, and as warres in &longs;ome &longs;ort may be &longs;aide to
<lb/>be a Raui&longs;her, &longs;o it cannot be denied, but peace is a great
<lb/>maker of Cuckolds.
<lb n="235"/>1 I, and it makes men hate one another.
<lb n="236"/>3 Rea&longs;on, becau&longs;e they then le&longs;&longs;e neede one another:
<lb/>The Warres for my money. I hope to &longs;ee Romanes as
