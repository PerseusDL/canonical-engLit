              in Shakespeare, but a good deal more visually than in Plutarch, who says of him in two
              sentences that he was &lsquo;one of the valliantest the Romaines had at that
              time,&rsquo; and that, having entered Corioli with Marcius, he, &lsquo;when he

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Page</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Introd.,</hi> p. 24): The little we
              read of Cominius gives us a life-like portrait of him, and leaves a pleasing
              impression on us. He is evidently of a <hi rend="italic">frank and generous
              nature.</hi> As Coriolanus' superior officer he has under his command a soldier more
              famous than himself, so that he may acquire blame, but can hardly gain credit from the
              expedition against the Volsces. Such a trying position would have made most commanders
              morose and jealous, some would have found it intolerable. Cominius, however, accepts
              it with the utmost frankness, and the generals work together with hearty good
              fellowship and satisfactory result. Cominius generously attributes all the success to
              his brave colleague. He will not allow Coriolanus to conceal his great deeds, but
              proclaims them openly and emphatically before the Senate and people, and dwells on the
              disinterestedness of Coriolanus' conduct. Thus, instead of looking upon his second in
              command as a dangerous rival and endeavoring to extenuate and disparage his success in
              the field, he acknowledges his superiority to himself and extols his deeds of heroism
              on every occasion. Nor is all this done in a forced or perfunctory manner, as though
              he were straining to hide real mortification and jealousy by outward demonstrations of
              goodwill. </p>

                <hi rend="bold">Menenius Agrippa</hi>
              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Dennis</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> ii, 385): If <hi
                rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> was so conversant with the Ancients, how comes he to
              have introduc'd some Characters into his Plays so unlike what they are to be found in
              History? In the Character of <hi rend="italic">Menenius</hi> he has doubly offended
              against that Historical Resemblance: For first whereas <hi rend="italic">Menenius</hi>
              was an eloquent person, <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> has made him a downright
              Buffoon. And how is it possible for any man to conceive a <hi rend="italic">Ciceronian
                Jack</hi>
            </p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Pudding?</hi> Never was any Buffoon eloquent, or wise, or witty, or
              virtuous. All the good and ill qualities of a <hi rend="italic">Buffoon</hi> are
              summed up in one word, and that is a <hi rend="italic">Buffoon.</hi> And secondly,
              whereas <hi rend="italic">Shakespear</hi> has made him a Hater and Contemner and
              Villifier of the People, we are assur'd by the <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> Historian
              that Menenius was extremely popular. He was so very far from opposing the Institution
              of the Tribunes, as he is represented in <hi rend="italic">Shakespear,</hi> that he
              was chiefly instrumental in it. After the People had deserted the City, and sat down
              upon the sacred Mountain, he was the chief of the Delegates whom the Senate deputed to
              them, as being look'd upon to be the Person who would be most agreeable to them. In
              short, this very <hi rend="italic">Menenius</hi> both liv'd and dy'd so very much
              their Favourite that, dying poor, he had pompous Funerals at the Expence of the <hi
                rend="italic">Roman</hi> People.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Viehoff</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Jahrbuch,</hi> iv, 48): Among the subordinate characters Menenius
              serves, on the one hand, in the highest way possible as a factor in the course of the
              action and as a foil to the protagonist; on the other hand, though like to a figure
              cast in a mould, he is full of individual life. From the historic materials for
              Menenius the poet could have created quite a different personality; since he worked
              upon the people advising and composing them it would have been easy to represent him
              as an earnest man overawing the rabble by his wisdom and worth. But how much greater
              advantage did the poet gain for his drama by the original coloring which he gave to
              this character! The Shakespearean Menenius is a goodnatured man about town of sanguine
              temperament and lively fancy, an irascible old man, whose temper turns easily and
              quickly, a babbler, given to the cracking of jokes, and likewise commonly to
              exaggeration and bragging, a friend to a good cup of warm wine and a well spread
              table, to which he ascribes significant effects on the inner man, gallant towards
              women, a spirited praiser of Coriolanus, a friend of peace, and though outwardly
              patrician, a man who yet has a heart for the people and desires their proper
              well-being. Through this mixture of characteristics he becomes qualified for the many
              functions which he exercises in the drama. His effect on the course of the action is
              not only through the mollification of the people by means of his fable, he serves also
              repeatedly as mediator to make the first impression on the stiff will of his young
              favorite. At the same time he is in his cheerful, easy-going nature an effective foil
              to the earnest, narrow-minded friend; if perchance one would think that a man so firm,
              so laconically given, such a despiser of outward show as Coriolanus should feel
              himself drawn to an old man whose moods are so evanescent, so talkative, and loving
              exaggeration, it is actually no less psychologically correct than that a man so heroic
              should have chosen as his wife a woman of so tender a nature as Virgilia. Furthermore,
              Menenius by his enthusiastic admiration for Coriolanus, sets up a glass wherein is
              reflected a picture of the latter, if also many times magnified as in a concave
              mirror. In conclusion the poet makes use of this character, with its ludicrous
              coloring, to lighten the tension which predominates in this drama and to reduce to
              artistic proportions its deep and powerful keynote.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Gervinus</hi> (p. 765): The most striking personage next to Coriolanus is Menenius
              Agrippa. Except the wellknown fable of the belly and the members, Shakespeare found
              nothing further concerning him in his English Plutarch than the remark that he was the
              pleasantest old man in the Senate. From this hint he has formed the lively character,
              to whom he awards the benevolent office, beside the ragged demi-god, of being
              contented to be a man amongst men. In all his individual qualities this contrast is
              carried </p>
            <p>out, although it seems as if unintentional. He has none of Coriolanus' thirst for
              fame; he rather rejoices in the fame of his friend; he idolises him, and it gives him
              an estate of seven years' health when Coriolanus condescends to write to him. . . .
              Even with the will to speak the truth of his hero he involuntarily oversteps its
              bounds. It is easy to him to be his unselfish admirer because his own talents lie in
              quite another direction. Age has broken his warlike strength, though his brave mind
              still looks out here and there, when in extremity he calls the nobles to help
              Coriolanus, and says he could himself &lsquo;take up a brace of the best of the
              plebeians.&rsquo; But his true strength lies rather in mental superiority; his
              excellence is that of a clever orator. . . . He manages the furious Coriolanus
              according to his nature, sparing while he blames him, cursing his unkindness, and
              excusing and praising him in a breath. With Coriolanus he takes the part of the
              people, on account of their placability, and with the people, that of Coriolanus. . .
              . When Coriolanus is banished he is civil and pliant towards the tribunes; when the
              exile advances towards Rome he is maliciously cheerful, and in return for this he has
              to suffer the malice of the Volscian guards when his eloquence has failed to persuade
              Coriolanus. In these last scenes the weaknesses of old age show themselves more
              plainly, and in the midst of them his nobler nature appears more distinctly. This is
              excellently depicted and will give the actor enough to do. The struggle in Coriolanus
              between proud indifference and a heart breaking under the effect of his friends' first
              entreaties; in Menenius between confidence and renewed disappointment, and, beneath
              the cloak of playfulness, the inward struggle between friend and country, and the
              resolve of the cheerful old man to end like a Roman&mdash;these are contradictions
              which it requires the utmost art to reconcile.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Kreyssig</hi> (i, 477): We are not, on the whole, prepared to accord such good taste
              to this senatorial joker as has been brought forward by many commentators and admirers
              of Shakespeare. With his narrow aristocratic perception, his unrestrained explosions
              of contempt for the people he owes his popularity principally to a negative
              peculiarity, to which we can only give a measurable admiration. He himself best gives
              us the secret of his art of a statesman. He thinks what he says and expends his
              wickedness by his tongue. The larger part of his strength consists in his weakness. It
              is openheartedness and his merry man-of-the-world manner that takes the sting from his
              pride of nobility. He is known, indeed, as a Patrician, but as a merry one; his small,
              lovable failings take the sting from his malice. We need not weigh the words of a man
              who cares more for a glass of heated wine than for one of Tiber water; and who has
              more to do with the posteriors of the night than the forehead of the morning. Thus his
              plebeian manners in part fill up the cleft which his fundamental aristocratic
              disposition created between him and the people.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Delius</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Jahrbuch,</hi> xix, p. 37) points out that in nearly
              all the cases of friendship as portrayed by Shakespeare the friends are of nearly the
              same age; that there is thus a certain agreement in views and characteristics since
              the friends are on a like footing. &lsquo;But quite otherwise,&rsquo; he
              continues, &lsquo;must the connection be between an older man and a young one, and
              just such a relationship has Shakespeare set forth in that between Coriolanus and
              Menenius, one might say created, for Plutarch afforded him nothing in this direction.
              In Plutarch Menenius Agrippa appears as the well-meaning, pacifying senator, who
              quiets the people with his well-known fable, but otherwise has nothing to do with the
              younger Marcius. It remained for our poet to represent these two, of opposing
              personalities, firmly knit together </p>
            <p>in closest friendship. First of all Shakespeare shows them to us as friends on
              account of like political views, as patrician opponents of the plebeians, and the
              plebeian fickleness; only that Menenius clothes his opposition to them with the cloak
              of friendliness to the people, while Coriolanus in his passionate manner gives the
              roughest expression possible to his disgust for these innovators. Later in the course
              of the drama the personal connection between them is brought to light. Menenius
              defends his young friend from the charges of pride and spite which the Tribunes
              pronounce against him when returning from the field, and hardly knows how to act for
              admiration when he receives the joyful message of the victory and near approach of his
              beloved Marcius. When he hears only of the letter which Marcius has written to him and
              which awaits him at his house, he declares himself rejuvenated by seven years. Even
              the wounds which Marcius brings back are to his old friend quite in keeping, that is,
              if they be not too large, because wounds proclaim the hero, and with righteous pride
              he enumerates all those which his darling had up to this time
              borne.&rsquo;&mdash;[The remaining portion of these remarks on the friendship
              of Menenius and Coriolanus is, for the most part, a discursive and somewhat verbose
              account of the scenes wherein they appear together; ending with the scene at the
              Volscian outposts which, as Delius says, is the final rupture of their friendship and
              a complete severance of all ties between them; they never met again. &mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Lloyd</hi> (ap. <hi
                rend="smallcap">Singer</hi>, ii, p. 489): The pleasant old Senator has a contempt
              for the &lsquo;beastly plebeians&rsquo; and the Tribunes their
              &lsquo;herdsmen&rsquo; as hearty as Coriolanus, and even expresses it as
              plainly and as coarsely, and yet he remains acceptable to both, and has the character
              of having always loved the people, on the strength of the hearty joviality of his
              temperament, his tendency to ridicule rather than to revile, and it must be said, at
              bottom, so much esteem for the people that he does not consider his own individual
              dignity a counterbalance for the lives of the whole of them. We may note how his
              apologue [of the belly and the members] appears, from the character of his subsequent
              speech, to be the natural form into which his expressions of practical wisdom
              overflow; the spiritual world reveals itself to him in an incarnation of physical and
              material analogies, and his ideas willingly come abroad clothed in trope and metaphor
              of which homeliness seems to be a prime recommendation. The discussion in Rome is a
              rent that &lsquo;must be patched with cloth of any color&rsquo;; for the
              unpopular Marcius&mdash;&lsquo;The service of the foot (one of the members we
              before heard of) Being once gangrened, is not then respected For what it was
              before.&rsquo; The relentless Coriolanus is figured by &lsquo;yond&rsquo;
              coign of the capitol, yond' corner-stone&rsquo;; &lsquo;there is a difference
              between a grub and a butterfly, yet your butterfly was a
              grub&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;he no more remembers his mother now than an eight
              year old horse&rsquo;;&mdash;&lsquo;Mark what mercy his mother shall bring
              from him: there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male
                tiger.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">C. C. Clarke</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Sh. Characters,</hi> p. 479): Among the secondary characters in this play the most
              estimable, as well as the most interesting, is old Menenius, the Patrician and
              Senator. He forms an amiable link between the two orders; he is precisely the
              character a nobleman should be; wearing the insignia of his rank with a bland and easy
              dignity; gracefully condescending, and even familiar with the commonalty, sympathising
              with their wants, difficulties, and privations; and this gives him the privilege to
              speak to them with the authority of his longer experience, with better education and
              knowledge. This same sympathy, too, which they all recognise, gives him the warrant to
              visit their misconduct and their </p>
            <p>senseless waverings, their vacillations, irrational turbulence, and revolt, with an
              asperity they would ill bear from another who cared less for them and their destitute
              condition. It is observable that throughout all his displeasure and petulance against
              the mob Menenius never makes use of a cruel or even unkind speech: in his spleen he is
              sufficiently and humorously contemptuous; but we hear no such expression as the
              scoundrelly exultation of Coriolanus at the approaching war with the Volscians, when
              he says: &lsquo;I am glad on't; then we shall have means to vent Our musty
              superfluity&rsquo;; a speech admirably in character with one who considered the
              masses below him in the commonwealth only as so much material to build up his own pomp
              and ambition. Menenius has described his own nature and temper in that sparring scene
              between himself and the Tribunes of the People, Brutus and Sicinius. It is a happy
              display of a testy, wayward, and humorous old man, with a rich vein of
              kind-heartedness running through his testy temper. &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Stapfer</hi> (p. 446): We might expect to find in Menenius Agrippa, as he plays the
              part of mediator between the Patricians and the Plebeians, a wise and moderate
              politician, equally removed from the extreme opinions of either party, a perfect man,
              in fact, like the <hi rend="italic">Aristes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                >Cl&eacute;antes</hi> in Moli&egrave;re, who are always softly and gravely
              insisting upon moderation in all things, and complain sadly of the unreasonableness of
              men. But Shakespeare is not wont to introduce these wellbalanced moralists into his
              scenes, whose whole knowledge consists in striking a balance between the false and the
              true. They are certainly not very entertaining personages; what interest they may
              possess is not of a dramatic kind, but belongs to them as monuments of
              Moli&egrave;re's courageous good sense, as the expression of a particular state of
              society, and of a particular period, in which reason was held in higher esteem than
              any other of the poetic faculties. . . . Shakespeare had a horror of the frightfully
              tiresome person of the reasonable and ratiocinative type. The laughter-moving
              diversity of the innumerable fools who play a part in the great human tragi-comedy is
              the stuff whereof he makes his plays; we need not, therefore, expect to meet with a
              sage philosopher in Menenius Agrippa. . . . Being what he is, it is easy to divine
              that he plays the part of mediator out of no feelings of calm conviction, or elevated
              sense of justice, and, in fact, the only reason of his setting his wits to work to
              reconcile the hostile parties is that he is a fat old fellow, who likes to be
              comfortable and able to empty his bottle in peace and quiet; and civil dissensions
              spoil a cup of hot wine even more than many drops of Tiber water. In the quarrel of
              the other members with the stomach it was greatly to his interest, as part and parcel
              of the stomach, to re-establish order as soon as possible, and it may be fairly
              conjectured that the idea of his fable was suggested to him by the hindrances thrown
              in the way of his ease and good living. . . . But his character is shown most clearly,
              with his vanity, his fund of good humour, his lively inconsequent sallies, and his
              fussy airs as a hard worked patriot, after the blow has fallen and Coriolanus has
              turned traitor to Rome. Half a dozen times he repeats to the Tribunes: &lsquo;You
              have made good work&rsquo;; in the midst of the general consternation he takes a
              satirical pleasure in their political humiliation, and though it is not a time for
              laughter, he still, like an incorrigible jester, continues to pour out his jokes. . .
              . Shakespeare's Menenius Agrippa is a good-hearted man in the main, but of no real
              worth morally or even intellectually, in spite of his celebrated fable.&mdash;<hi

              To analyse the character of Menenius we should advert to his Courage, which never once
              forsakes him, even </p>
            <p>amid dangers whose termination is utterly unforeseen: many men can boldly face an
              enemy in the field, who would shrink before an armed and tumultuous populace; many can
              risque dangers in concert with others, who when alone consult and obey timidity under
              the spacious name of prudence. . . . Courage, in such persons, appears a varying
              quality, a flashing flame, rather than a steady light; but the courage of Menenius is
              uniform: he speaks plainly to the people and plainly to Coriolanus, neither dreads the
              headstrong rashness of the former nor the fierce sallies of the latter; his judgment
              sees the path proper to be pursued, and his courage prompts him clearly to deliver his
              opinion in advising it. But his courage is not of that cast which repulses the union
              of other Virtues; his Prudence and Management no less merit observation than his
              courage: he makes free with himself when about to make free with others; qualifies, by
              a general oddity of remark and expression, the severity of those sarcasms which he has
              in reserve; humorously descants on his own private character, and by his eccentric and
              jocose treatment of himself induces us to admit with less scrutiny his reflections on
              others. . . . We see no starts of passion in Menenius, no sudden hurricane transports
              him to excess, but one even tenor of mind and sentiment accompanies him: ruffled only
              as accidents ruffle it, but never outrageous or turbulent. Sensible of injuries in his
              own person or in that of his friend, but seeking no illicit mode of gratifying
              revenge. Ever desirous of seeing the most cheerful side of things, and rather yielding
              to the impulse of joy than to the melancholy of dejection, he preserves that
              moderation which readily finds opportunities in circumstances around it, and equally
              readily improves them.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Page</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Introd.,</hi> p. 22): Menenius is perhaps the most complicated, the most difficult
              to analyse, in some respects the most Shakespearian of all the characters in the play.
              He sometimes <hi rend="italic">reminds us of Coriolanus.</hi> He has the same contempt
              for the &lsquo;rabble,&rsquo; the same indignation and impatience at the
              thought of their interfering in the government of the state, he often tells them his
              mind in pretty plain language, but his objurations are milder, less frequent, and less
              insulting; he stoops to reason with them, and endeavors to enlighten their
              understanding by parables. To gain certain ends he sees no harm in flattering and
              cajoling the common people according to &lsquo;the custom&rsquo; of the
              country. He shows <hi rend="italic">considerable diplomatic skill</hi> in his efforts
              to reconcile Coriolanus and the plebeians, or at least to prevent their discordant
              natures from breaking out into open rupture; but this almost impossible task is beyond
              his powers, and he fails, as perhaps every one else would have done. He tries his hand
              again in the attempt to negotiate between the terrified Romans and Coriolanus in the
              camp of the Volsces. Though he has great confidence of obtaining at least a favourable
              reception, and explains Cominius&rsquo; brusque dismissal to want of tact, his
              mission, from the very nature of the case, results in an immediate and ignominious
              failure. His undertaking was one in which success was possible to only one person in
              the whole world&mdash;Volumnia. His language is <hi rend="italic">pithy</hi> and
                <hi rend="italic">sententious;</hi> he possesses a <hi rend="italic">vein of dry
                humour</hi> which reminds us of Jacques is <hi rend="italic">As You Like It.</hi>
              His fable of the <hi rend="italic">Belly and the Members</hi> is one of the most
              striking features in the play; it is apt in substance and couched in quaint and
              characteristic language. Almost every speech of Menenius illustrates this point. He
              possesses a <hi rend="italic">warm and faithful heart.</hi> He loves and admires
              Coriolanus, who calls him &lsquo;father&rsquo; and &lsquo;old and true
              Menenius.&rsquo; . . . Coriolanus loves him in return. &lsquo;You know the
              very road into his kindness,&rsquo; says Brutus, and Coriolanus&rsquo; own
              language shows us that </p>
            <p>Menenius was dear to him.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Brooke</hi> (p. 227):
              Menenius is the old and jovial aristocrat who loves a cup of hot wine and adores a
              hero like Coriolanus; hasty in temper, but keeping no malice, and in politics eager
              for moderate counsels; bluff of speech because he is old and because of his
              class-contempt for the people, which contempt he generally modifies into good-humoured
              attacks on their follies. He is endured, but seen through, by the tribunes of the
              people&mdash;&lsquo;Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.&rsquo; A
              thorough patrician, who yet desires to be hail-fellowwell-met with the people; who has
              among them the fame of caring for them, but who does not really care for their wrongs
              in comparison with the smallest right the patricians claim; the prosperous
              conservative, quite ready to help the people provided the people are kept down. The
              possibility of any democratic change never enters his mind. The world of Rome will
              always go on as it is now. You may as well, he says to the citizens, &lsquo;Strike
              at the heavens with your staves as lift them Against the Roman state.&rsquo; The
              patricians, the senate, are the centre of Rome; if the centre be weakened the people
              will perish&mdash;and he tells his story of the belly and the rebellious members
              of the body. &lsquo;But we are perishing now,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;and
              the nobility are the cause.&rsquo; &lsquo;Wait, keep quiet, don't disturb the
              state, all will soon be quite comfortable. The one thing needful is no change. All
              your good comes from the patricians.&rsquo; When change has been wrought, and he
              hears that Tribunes have been granted, he does not understand it. &lsquo;This is
              strange,&rsquo; he says. Then when further change is wrought, and Coriolanus is
              banished, Menenius accepts the Tribunes and the change; and then, when Rome turns
              against the Tribunes, throws himself back into the old position. His conservatism is
              permanent opportunism. However, at this early point of the play (in his belief in the
              everlasting continuance of the state as it is) the blindness of this Roman Polonius is
              clear though he seems so wise. Coriolanus sees twice as far just because his hatred of
              the people opens his eyes. He knows, when the Tribunes are given to the people, that
              the predominance of his class is doomed. Hatred, often blind, is sometimes keen-eyed.
              There are many instances of the blindness of Menenius, of the clear sight of
              Coriolanus. Here is one. Menenius is the slave of custom; Coriolanus is not. One of
              the touches of the play nearest to his character is where his pride, and in this case
              his intelligence, overcomes his conservatism, and he throws precedent overboard, <hi
                rend="bq"> &lsquo;Custom calls me to 't:<lb/> What custom wills, in all things
                should we do 't,<lb/> The dust on antique time would lie unswept,<lb/> And
                mountainous error be too highly heap'd<lb/> For truth to o'er-peer.&rsquo;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is not the conservative position. Menenius cannot agree with him; Coriolanus
              must follow all the precedents of the past. Again and again he implores him for
              temperate conduct, and the battle in his mind between love and admiration for
              Coriolanus and disapproval of his uncontrolled choler is excellently drawn by
              Shakespeare. Yet, while he disapproves and is even weary of the furious temper of his
              friend, he hates the people the more because they attack his friend. From the moment
              the battle is set in array till the banishment of Coriolanus no one is harder on the
              people than Menenius. No Philippe &Eacute;galit&eacute; is to be trusted. The
              traditions of their class are stronger than their popular good nature. </p>

              Menenius illustrates, more than any other character in Shakespeare that occurs to me,
              how a seed of suggestion will fructify in Shakespeare's imagination. All that Plutarch
              says about Menenius is that he was &lsquo;chief man&rsquo; of the embassy of
              &lsquo;the pleasantest old men and the most acceptable to the people&rsquo;
              who were sent by the Senate to remonstrate with them after their secession to the <hi
                rend="italic">Mons Sacer</hi> outside Rome; that he used successfully
              &lsquo;many good persuasions and gentle requests to the people&rsquo;; and
              ended with his &lsquo;notable tale&rsquo; of the belly and the other members
              of the body.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 498): In the drama
              Menenius is undoubtedly the chief of the young man's [Coriolanus] friends as well as
              one of the most prominent persons; and what has Plutarch to say about him? He is
              introduced only in connection with the fable which he tells the seceders to the Holy
              Hill, and, apart from the fable, all that we hear of him is confined to a few
              sentences. . . . Even the few particulars given Shakespeare alters or neglects. It is
              not to the secessionists on the Mons Sacer, but to a street mob in Rome, that the
              fable is told. It not merely serves to lubricate in advance the negotiations that
              result in the Tribunate, but effectually discomfits the murmurers, and Menenius learns
              only subsequently and to his surprise that the Senate has meanwhile conceded the
              political innovation. There is no hint in Plutarch of his being himself one of the
              Patricians, and if Shakespeare glanced at Holland's <hi rend="italic">Livy</hi> he
              would see that, in point of fact, tradition assigned to him a plebeian origin. Above
              all, he has no dealings whatever with Marcius, and, according to Livy, died a year
              before his banishment. Plutarch thus furnishes hardly anything for the portrait of the
              man, and nothing at all for his relations with the hero. </p>

              capacity; they show themselves in the settling of small matters as impatient and
              violent as he does in great things and from great motives; they place their petty
              ambition on the obeisance of the populace, whilst their eyes could not even reach to

              itself in the low motives they attribute to him. They are constantly on the watch for

              As individuals Brutus and Sicinius cannot be distinguished one from the other. Only
              once before has Shakespeare with his abundant wealth of character invention portrayed
              with evident design two similar parallel figures, that is to say, Rosencrantz and
              Guildenstern, although these two perhaps stand in the moral scale a little higher than
              our two Tribunes. Both these pairs of villains likewise have this in common: they are
              characterised for the most part as types, not as individuals, which is somewhat
              unusual in Shakespeare. Taken together Brutus and Sicinius are one and the same man;
              the poet was obliged to separate them only that he might create and bring out their
              train of thought in the form of dialogue. The closest investigation fails in deciding
              which of the two, Brutus or Sicinius, bears away the palm for baseness. If we examine
              critically who particularly of all the characters in the tragedy for the most part
              misprise and abuse the people, it will be found that not Coriolanus or the other
              patricians, but the Tribunes of the People are directly to blame. In them is united
              every criterion of human underhandedness: hatred and malice towards everything great
              and noble, ingratitude, hypocrisy, and cowardice, resorting to the basest means to
              attain their own selfish ends. With diabolical calculation on his weakness they hound
              Coriolanus to his death, and while denouncing him as a traitor they push him into the
              arms of treason itself. His aristocratic pride and his measureless impetuosity are no
              mitigating circumstances for these two, who, reckoning on these weaknesses, instigate
              him to treason. Coriolanus's lack of restraint will excuse the hostile attitude of the
              people&mdash;to a certain extent justify it&mdash;but it will not excuse that
              of the Tribunes. The parts of these two are generally represented on the stage as too
              harmless; in both these Tribunes there glows a spark of devilish villainy. Their
              representation cannot be entrusted to secondary talent, since the r&ocirc;les
              demand a large versatility, and the individuality must be finely wrought out if the
              poet's design is to be clearly brought to light. In the first place, a base ambition
              and measureless vanity dominate their bearing. To the people they are the most </p>
            <p>humane friends, the superzealous servants of their wishes, smiles and hand shakes are
              common to them. In the presence of Coriolanus they seek to demonstrate the value of
              their office, act the parts of acknowledgers and well-wishers, but therewith goad him
              with pin-pricks until he lays himself more and more open to attack, which thus gives
              countenance to their charges against him.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Cholmeley</hi>
                (<hi rend="italic">Introd.,</hi> xiii.): The Tribunes, though legendary persons,
              bear names well known in Rome, and Brutus is supposed to be a descendant of the
              husband of Lucretia and overthrower of Tarquin.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >MacCallum</hi> (p. 500): [In Plutarch's account of the Tribunate] Brutus is only
              once named, and nothing is said of his disposition or ways. Even of Sicinius, who is
              more conspicuous, we only read that he was &lsquo;the cruellest and
              stowtest&rsquo; of the two. But it is less their character than their policy that
              occupies Plutarch, and even their policy is presented in an ambiguous light. They are
              described as the only authors of the rising which culminated in the exodus from the
              city; but with that exodus Plutarch, on the whole, seems to sympathise. They are
              described as &lsquo;seditious tribunes&rsquo; when they oppose the
              colonisation of Velitr&aelig; and the renewal of the war; but Plutarch shows they
              had good grounds for doing so. Even their action against Coriolanus for opposing the
              grant of corn and advocating the abolition of their office was, from their own point
              of view and perhaps from any point of view, perfectly legitimate. We can only say that
              in the measures they took they were violent and unscrupulous. Yet when we consider the
              bitterness of party feeling and the exigencies of public life, they seem no worse than

              an exposition dealing with Shakespeare's Feminine Ideals this young Marcius has been
              singled out for affectionate mention, and extolled not only as a child drawn from the
              very marrow of Rome but also in himself the ideal child among the Shakespearian
              children. I am heartily sorry that I am not able to share in this great admiration for
              the boy. Valeria, the family friend, finds in him all that is most lovable, according
              to the wont of all chattering gossips, and what she praises as a mark of his
              determination seems to me but a savour of the wickedness of a little destroyer of
              animals [I, iii, 64-68]. The praise of his grandmother, who knows nothing in the world
              greater than her son Coriolanus, the arch-warrior, characterises the little urchin as
              the portrait of his father, especially as a warrior in miniature, and if he speaks to
              his father in the Volscian camp of his future heroic deeds&mdash;concerning which
              the history is for us quite silent&mdash;it only sounds more like the bluster of a

              general view Tullus serves as a foil to Coriolanus, and being in many degrees his
              rival, yet on the whole his inferior, being also covert instead of open, ambiguous
              instead of plain, and rather choosing to wear the mask of conspiracy than the genuine
              countenance of enmity, he contrasts, with great effect, the conspicuous failings of
              the hero of the piece, and produces a regret at the success of his machinations;
              since, if such a punishment was properly due, justice, not malevolence, ought to have
              inflicted it, it should not have been the office of Tullus Aufidius.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">C. C. Clarke</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sh. Characters,</hi> p. 480):
              The character of Tullus Aufidius is well placed in opposition with that of Coriolanus.
              It is no vulgar foil, no bald contrast, but it is superficially bright only. Beneath a
              show of martial eminence, which fits him to be the hero's antagonist, he possesses a
              low soul, which places him intrinsically beneath the great Roman. Where Coriolanus is
              proud, Aufidius is ambitious; where Coriolanus is loftily self-conscious, Aufidius is
              aspiring by self-seeking. Exteriorly Tullus forms no unworthy rival in arms with Caius
              Marcius, but interiorly, morally, he is immeasurably below him. With his usual
              delicacy, but vigour of delineation, the poet has depicted this from first to last. At
              the very outset we behold Tullus burning with desire to cope with Marcius, and to win
              some share of that warlike renown for which he is famous. He has a fever of military
              jealousy upon him which has its hot and its cold fits. He is seized with one of the
              latter on finding that Coriolanus is under his own roof, a poor and banished man;
              finding his great rival thus within his power, it allays his thirst of competition,
              and substitutes in its place a complacent feeling of patronage, which takes the
              appearance of chivalrous sentiment. But this impulse soon passes, and his old
              professional jealousy is rekindled at the first view of Coriolanus's reinstation in
              command. His vulgar nature cannot bear the sight of the other's pre-eminence; and this
              perpetual consciousness of inferiority goads him with ever sharper desire to attain
              superior rank. It makes him basely rejoice when he beholds Coriolanus give way to the
              pleading of his mother and his wife; it impels him to the villainy of working his
              downfall; it urges him to treachery and murder&mdash;crime. As an instance of
              Shakespeare's subtlety in drawing these moral portraitures it is to be observed that
              Aufidius, even at the best of his behaviour towards his noble rival, when he receives
              him with kindliness at his house at Antium, always addresses him as &lsquo;Caius
              Marcius&rsquo;; and the secret rankling which prompted the name is betrayed in
              open avowal where he subsequently calls him so, and the other exclaiming
              &lsquo;Marcius!&rsquo; he retorts: &lsquo;Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius; dost
              thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name Coriolanus in
              Corioli?&rsquo; It is in the moral inferiority of Tullus Aufidius, thus subtly
              drawn, that Shakespeare has presented him as an effective opposite to the principal
                character.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Gervinus</hi> (p. 765): The prevailing
              difference, which raises Coriolanus high above Tullus, is that <hi rend="italic"
              >he</hi> is of nobler nature, that in his bitterness of feeling he is seized by an
              unnatural enmity against his country, but he returns to his better nature; whereas
              Tullus is naturally malicious, and is flattered by the need of his enemy thus fleeing
              to him for protection; he forms an unnatural friendship with him, and then returns to
              his deceitful spite in the conspiracy against Coriolanus. &mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Viehoff</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Jahrbuch,</hi> iv, p. 50): The basic
              foundations of such a character as Aufidius must lie either in similarity to those of
              the protagonist or must be contrasted with them, since not mere dissimilarity but
              similarity and contrast incite </p>
            <p>eye and imagination to comparative observation of such figures. According to this
              formula Shakespeare has created the character of Aufidius. He is the pride of the
              Volscians as Coriolanus is the celebrated hero of the Romans. As Aufidius is the enemy
              most dreaded by the Romans, Coriolanus is the one most feared by the Volscians.
              Virgilia implores heaven to protect her husband in the presence of the ruthless
              Aufidius. Volumnia thinks of him as the man from whom, before all others, her son may
              win renown. Coriolanus himself pays him the highest praise and even maintains that
              were he not himself he would wish to be Aufidius. He is of the same heroic mould as
              Coriolanus, and in him likewise patriotism outweighs both love of deeds and love of
              fame; he says: &lsquo;I would I were a Roman, for I cannot, Being a Volsce, be
              that I am&rsquo; (I, x, 6, 7). But even as Homer is careful that the excellent
              Hector shall not grow above the greatness of Achilles, in like manner Shakespeare
              represents the heroic mood and strength of Aufidius related, indeed, to that of
              Coriolanus, but in secondary rank. The fight between the two heroes serves to this end
              to the smallest details; and just as Aufidius admits the superiority of Coriolanus,
              his own servants express the same view without any subterfuge. More than this, since
              these related characteristics bring out the contrasts in both characters, they assure
              to Coriolanus the major interest of the onlookers.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Hudson</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sh's Life, Art,</hi> etc., ii, 487): Tullus Aufidius
              makes a very effective foil to Coriolanus, the contrast between them being pressed
              forward in just the right way to show off the vein of true nobleness which there is in
              the latter. He has all the pride and passionateness of the hero without any of his
              gratitude and magnanimity. In Coriolanus the spirit of rivalry and emulation never
              passes the bounds of honour; in the other it turns to downright personal envy and
              hate. The hero glories in him as an antagonist, and loves to whip him in fair fight,
              but is far above all thought of ruining him or stabbing him in the dark. The shocking
              speech of Aufidius, in the first scene where he appears after the taking of Corioli,
              is a skilful forecast and premonition of his transport of baseness at the
              close.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Oechelha&uuml;ser</hi> (i, 294): What I have
              said in regard to the frequent unsatisfactory casting of the parts of the Tribunes
              will apply in greater degree to that of Aufidius, which is customarily entrusted to
              the juvenile leading man or the lover. This is utterly wrong. Aufidius is a
              character-part which must be assigned with great carefulness. There is, moreover, no
              motive to represent Aufidius as actually younger than Coriolanus; such, on the
              contrary, places in the way of the representation of the r&ocirc;le extraordinary
              difficulties. Generally speaking, all the r&ocirc;les in <hi rend="italic"
                >Coriolanus</hi> are so clearly drawn that the actor can hardly go wrong in the
              proper conception of each one; but that of Aufidius is not so clear. His treacherous
              nature is first made manifest at the end of the tragedy; his reception of Coriolanus
              bears the marks of genuine pleasure and heartiness. The fault of such a misconception
              of the actor or the public can only be ascribed to the omission, by the majority of
              adapters, of the last scene of Act I, which Shakespeare, as I firmly believe, has
              added solely for the characteristic speech of Aufidius. So little doubtful is it that
              this was the design of the poet is shown by his not finding in Plutarch at this point
              of the action any indication of Aufidius's treacherous thrusts at Coriolanus. Here is
              set forth the innermost designs of Aufidius, to which he remains unbrokenly true to
              the very end, that is, by every means, honourable or dishonourable, to destroy
              Coriolanus; at the altar, even under the protection of the host's hearth, he would
              murder him. Were this outburst of treacherous, </p>
            <p>ignoble rage but directed against his great vanquisher, then the scene in the house
              of Aufidius could most assuredly be shown as a real heartfelt welcome, especially as
              there is not sufficient means given to the actor to make clear to the audience the
              complete hypocrisy and artificiality of this reception by means of tone of voice and
              exaggerated evidences of amity. So, and not otherwise, is this reception of Coriolanus
              to be understood and represented. In Aufidius is personified by the poet the craft and
              treachery which, for the most part, characterise the conduct of war and politics of
              the Volscians. He is false through and through. He accepts Coriolanus as a friend not
              altogether from good nature&mdash;one with whom he later by chance falls
              out&mdash;but with the preconceived traitorous design to make use of him in his
              own interest against Rome and then insidiously, as he had sworn, to cast him aside.
              His whole behaviour towards Coriolanus is a subtle dissimulation, until in the final
              scene he throws aside the mask and the hero falls under the daggers of those incited
              by Aufidius. Only the final words of Aufidius addressed to the corpse of Coriolanus
              should be conceived as the expression of remorse, the moral reaction, and accordingly
              so uttered. In the fourth and fifth Acts Aufidius must make effective use of by-play
              in order that his falseness to Coriolanus may constantly be kept in evidence; in the
              last Act the captain attending him may be used effectively to this end.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Page</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Introd.,</hi> p. 23): Tullus Aufidius
              is a rash, hasty, impetuous man, completely under the guidance of <hi rend="italic"
                >impulse.</hi> This view of his character accounts for more of his actions and his
              speeches. He is a brave and able general, but his ardent desire to vie with Coriolanus
              makes him think more of a personal combat with his rival than of the prudent
              management of the war as a whole. His language is usually violent and hyperbolical.
              His hatred for Coriolanus is expressed in unmeasured terms. When worsted by him as a
              general he uses the most frightful imprecations against him, vowing vengeance in
              highly inflated sentences. . . . Aufidius is as impulsive in his friendship as in his
              hate. When Coriolanus comes to him at Antium after his banishment from Rome, Aufidius
              receives his great rival with open arms and &lsquo;a thousand welcomes,&rsquo;
              and declares him more a friend than ever an enemy. Nor have we any reason to consider
              these protestations as insincere; Aufidius' friendship is thoroughly genuine, but
              short lived.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">M&ouml;nch</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Jahrbuch,</hi> xlii, p. 146): Both Coriolanus and Aufidius appear alike in the
              passionate incitement of their natures, boiling over in the effort to predominate or
              to be of great account, impatient of every opposition to self-advancement. With each
              the devotion to the welfare of his country is alloyed with a large amount of egotism.
              But the Roman will rise through external opposition; the Volscian, through internal
              prejudice. The former desires before all else his own way; the latter, his own
              individual honour. Their dispositions are, indeed, as far asunder as pretentious pride
              and sensitive ambition. Or if not as far as obstinacy and irresolution (which would be
              saying too much), yet as obstinate steadfastness and lax unsteadfastness. Coriolanus
              likewise does not escape powerful crises and overthrows, yet he remains true to his
              own nature; he is twice unfaithful to the cause which he serves, and both times allows
              himself to be deeply moved by the accusation of &lsquo;Traitor&rsquo;;
              Aufidius becomes a traitor to his comrade gradually through smallness of mind. The
              former succumbs to his own supermanhood, the latter&mdash;if only
              morally&mdash;to his own quest for greatness. The contrast is certainly plain
              enough, if it be not so elementary as directness and craft, as the honorable man and
              the rogue, as the hero and the poltroon. The poet has delicate </p>
            <p>colours on his pallet.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 502): The
              chief features of Aufidius' character and the story of its development, the emulation
              that is dislodged by generosity, the generosity that is submerged in envy, were
              already supplied for Shakespeare's use [by Plutarch]. But the darker lines are lacking
              in the earlier picture. There is neither the unscrupulous rancour in his initial
              relations with Marcius that Shakespeare attributes to them nor the hypocritical
              pretense at the close. Plutarch does not bring the contrast with Coriolanus to a head.
              And in connection with this it should be observed that Tullus appears late and
              intervenes only incidentally. Less than a sentence is spared to his earlier antagonism
              with Coriolanus, nor is he present in the march on Rome, or during the siege. And this
              is typical of Plutarch's treatment of all the subordinate persons. They enter for a
              moment and are dismissed. But in Shakespeare they accompany the action throughout, and
              do this in such a way that they illustrate and influence the career of the hero, and
              have their own characters and careers illustrated and influenced by him. They are all,
              even young Marcius by description, introduced in the first four scenes, with an
              indication of their general peculiarities and functions, and with the single exception
              of Titus Lartius they continue to reappear almost to the end. </p>

              loveliest of all.&rsquo; Again in <hi rend="italic">Proserpina,</hi> II, i (5), he
              speaks of Virgilia as the &lsquo;perfect type of wife and mother, but without
              definiteness of character, nor quite strength of intellect enough entirely to hold her
              husband's heart. Else she had saved him: he would have left Rome in his
              wrath&mdash;but not her. Therefore it is his mother only that bends him: but she
              cannot save him.&rsquo; [See also note by Ruskin, II, i, 187.]&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Viehoff</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Jahrbuch,</hi> iv, p. 53): As a foil
              to the dominating womanly figure of Volumnia and likewise to Coriolanus, the poet has
              placed beside them Virgilia. The towering figure of the heroic mother-in-law and that
              of the stormy, unbending husband raise themselves in the presence of this womanly
              tender, silent, sensitive being so much the more strikingly. But tender as Virgilia
              seems, her character is yet rooted in firm soil, and holds her ground in what she
              judges fitting for herself, unmoved by the will of her dominant motherin-law, just as
              she quietly but firmly opposes her Roman feminine will to the obstinacy of her husband
              in the great scene of the fifth Act.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Oechelha&uuml;ser</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Einf&uuml;hrungen,</hi> i, 297):
              Virgilia should be young and fair, pale and mild, thoroughly </p>
            <p>maidenly in bearing, speech and behaviour, all of &lsquo;those dove's eyes That
              can make gods forsworn.&rsquo; But with all this her yielding nature must not seem
              unstable weakness. In the first Act she shows herself quite as determined to withstand
              the appeals of her mother-in-law and her friend, as she shows herself a Roman woman in
              the last Act. Virgilia's by-play must be wrought out with highest skill and,
              especially in the scene of welcome, the farewell scene, and the great persuasion scene
              of the last act, this last demands a very skilful interplay with that of Coriolanus.
                &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Brooke</hi> (p. 244): Virgilia is as quiet as a
              forest lake. She will not leave the house while Coriolanus is away. The streets or
              shows of Rome shall not see her till he returns, and she is firm as a rock in this. A
              steadfast resolvedness attends on her quietness. Silence is her chief speech. All
              through the play she scarcely speaks. Yet she is alive before us. Only the greatest
              artist could, with a few touches here and there, placed exactly where they should be,
              and in fitness to their place, paint a whole character with such force and livingness
              that she remains forever clear, forever interesting. Shakespeare had done this for
              Cordelia; he does it again for Virgilia. When Volumnia praises the battle-rage of
              Coriolanus, and extols his blood and wounds, Virgilia cries: &lsquo;His bloody
              brow! Oh, Jupiter, no blood! . . . Heaven bless my lord from fell Aufidius!&rsquo;
              And we know her heart from that moment. When Coriolanus meets her on his triumphant
              return from Corioli, he meets her with this word: &lsquo;My gracious silence,
              hail!&rsquo; And we seem to see in the tender words, and in the admiration of
              &lsquo;My gracious silence,&rsquo; the secret married life and love of
              Virgilia and her stormy husband. All through the long talk of Volumnia with the
              senators and Coriolanus about the consulship Virgilia does not say one word. The only
              time she breaks out into speech is against the Tribunes after the banishment of her
              husband, and her strong words then are sufficiently motived by the occasion. Twice
              only does she speak in that great scene when with his mother she comes to plead for
              Rome, and the secret depths and even fierceness of her Roman nature are shown in the
              force and tenderness with which she urges her right as wife and mother on her husband.
              &lsquo;Thou shalt tread,&rsquo; says Volumnia, &lsquo;if thou march to
              Rome, upon thy mother's womb.&rsquo; &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Virgilia.</hi>
              Ay, and mine, that brought you forth this boy.&rsquo; (The words of Volumnia are
              Plutarch's; Virgilia's, Shakespeare's.) Only long silence can concentrate so much into
              a few words! And we hear of her no more.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi>
              (p. 566): Virgilia takes comparatively little pleasure in the brilliance of
              Coriolanus's career and is more concerned for his life than for his glory. When
              Volumnia recalls how she sent him forth as a lad to win honour, Virgilia's heart
              pictures his possible death, and would that have been compensated? For she loves in
              the first place not the hero but the husband, and her love makes her timorous. She has
              none of her mother-in-law's assurance that his prowess is without match and beyond
              comparison. When &lsquo;wondrous things&rsquo; are told of him how
              characteristic are their respective comments: &lsquo;<hi rend="italic"
              >Virgilia.</hi> The gods grant them true! <hi rend="italic">Volumnia.</hi> True! pow,
              wow!&rsquo; How differently they feel about his contest with his rival:
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Virgilia.</hi> Heaven bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
                <hi rend="italic">Volumnia.</hi> He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee And tread
              upon his neck.&rsquo; So she shrinks from the thoughts of blood and wounds over
              which Volumnia gloats, and trembles at the dangers of the campaign. Devoured by
              suspense, she is in no mood to meet the ordinary social claims on her rank and sex,
              but shuts herself up within her four walls, and wears out the time over household
              tasks. Her seclusion and the attempts to </p>
            <p>draw her from it must not be misunderstood. They have sometimes been taken as
              pictures of domestic narrow-mindedness, on the one hand, and callous frivolity on the
              other. But frivolity is unthinkable in Volumnia; we may be sure she would never advise
              or do anything unbefitting the Roman matron. And it is quite opposed to the impression
              Valeria produces; we may be sure she would never suggest it. In Plutarch's story it is
              she who proposes and urges the deputation of women to Coriolanus, and though
              Shakespeare, to suit his own purpose, transfers by implication the credit of this to
              Volumnia, Plutarch's statement was enough to prevent him from transforming the true
              authoress of the idea into the fashionable gadabout that some critics have alleged her
              to be. On the contrary, with him she calls forth the most purely poetical passage in
              the whole play, and she does so by the vestal dignity and severity of her character.
              Coriolanus greets her in the camp: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;The noble sister of
                Publicola,<lb/> The moon of Rome; chaste as the icicle<lb/> That's curdied by the
                frost from purest snow,<lb/> And hangs on Dian's temple: dear
                Valeria!&rsquo;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The woman to whom this splendid compliment is paid by one who never speaks otherwise
              than he thinks is assuredly no more obnoxious than Volumnia herself to the charge of
              levity. They are both great high-hearted Roman ladies who do not let their private or
              public solicitudes interfere with their customary social routine, and Valeria visits
              her friend to cheer her in her anxiety, as she would have her, in turn, visit and
              comfort their common acquaintance. But Virgilia is cast in a gentler mould, though
              neither is she lacking in character, spirit, and magnanimity. Of course, she is not an
              aggressive woman, and she feels that the home is the place for her. She speaks seldom,
              and when she does her words are few. It is typical that she greets her husband when he
              returns a victor with no articulate welcome, but with her more eloquent tears. He
              addresses her in half humorous, half tender reproach, &lsquo;My gracious silence,
              hail!&rsquo; A wonderful touch that comes from a wonderful insight. It may well be
              asked, as it has been asked, how Shakespeare <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> that
              Virgilia's heart was too full for words. But with all this, she shows abundant
              resolution, readiness, and patriotism. She is adamant to the commands of her imperious
              mother-in-law and the entreaties of her insistent friend when they urge her to break
              her self-imposed retirement. She too has her rebuke for the insolent Tribunes. Above
              all, she, too, plays her part in turning Coriolanus from his revenge. In that scene,
              after her wont, she does not say much, less than two lines in all, that serve to
              contain the simple greeting and the quick answer to her husband's warning that he no
              longer sees things as he did: &lsquo;The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
              Makes you think so.&rsquo; But who shall say that &lsquo;those dove's eyes
              Which can make gods forsworn&rsquo; did not shed their influence on his mother's
              demand, and help him to break his vindictive vow. Remember, too, that the sacrifice
              this implied would mean more to her than to Volumnia, for though she likewise can
              dedicate what she holds dearest on the altar of her country, her affections, her home,
              Marcius as an individual, bulk more largely in her life. And if she loves him, we see
              how fondly he loves her. More than once or twice he alludes to his happiness as
              bridegroom, husband, and father. When she appears before him, his ejaculations and the </p>
            <p>tenderness of his appeal, &lsquo;Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny,&rsquo;
              speak volumes, in a mouth like his, for the keenness of his affection. To express the
              bliss that he feels in the salute of re-union this hero-lover can find analogues only
              in his banishment and his vengeance: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;O! a kiss<lb
                  rend="RIGHT"/> Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!<lb/> Now, by the jealous
                queen of heaven, that kiss<lb/> I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip<lb/> Hath
                virgin'd it e'er since.&rsquo;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>This woman then with her love and sweetness, that strike such responsive chords in
              the rude breast of her lord, is apparently well fitted to smooth the harshness of his
              dealings with his fellow-men; and this would seem all the more likely since her
              gentleness is not of that flabby kind that cannot hold or bind, but is strengthened by
              firmness of will and largeness of feeling. All the same, she exerts no influence
              whatever before the very end on her husband's public life or even on his general
              character, because she has no interest in or aptitude for concerns of his busy
              practical career. She has chosen her own orbit in her home, and her love has no desire
              to step beyond.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">A. C. Bradley</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Coriolanus,</hi> p. 18): Ruskin, whose terms of praise and blame were never
              overcautious, wrote of Virgilia as &lsquo;perhaps the loveliest of Shakespeare's
              characters.&rsquo; Others have described her as a shrinking submissive being,
              afraid of the very name of a wound, and much given to tears. This description is true;
              and, I may remark in passing, it is pleasant to remember that the hero's letter to his
              mother contained a full account of his wounds, while his letter to his wife did not
              mention them at all. But the description of these critics can hardly be the whole
              truth about a woman who inflexibly rejects the repeated invitations of her formidable
              mother-in-law and her charming friend to leave her house; who later does what she can
              to rival Volumnia in rating the Tribunes; and who at last quietly seconds her
              assurance that Coriolanus shall only enter Rome over her body. Still these added
              traits do not account for the indefinable impression which Ruskin received (if he did
              not rightly interpret it) and which thousands of readers share. It comes in part from
              that kind of muteness in which Virgilia resembles Cordelia, and which is made to
              suggest a world of feeling in reserve. And in part it comes from the words of her
              husband. His greeting when he returns from the war and she stands speechless before
              him, and his exclamation when he sees her approaching at their last meeting and speaks
              first of her and not of Volumnia.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">J. M. Murry</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">London Mercury,</hi> Feb., 1922, p. 388): Of all the characters in <hi
                rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> one alone can be said to be truly congenial; and she
              is the least substantial of them all. Virgilia, Coriolanus's wife, though she is
              present throughout the whole of four scenes, speaks about a hundred words. But a
              sudden, direct light is cast upon her by a phrase which takes our breath with beauty
              when Coriolanus welcomes her on his triumphant return as &lsquo;My gracious
              silence!&rsquo; Magical words! They give a miraculous substance to our fleeting,
              fading glimpses of a lovely vision which seems to tremble away from the clash of arms
              and pride that reverberates through the play. Behind the disdainful warrior and his
              Amazonian mother, behind the vehement speech of this double Lucifer, the exquisite,
              timid spirit of Virgilia shrinks out of sight into the haven of her quiet home. One
              can almost hear the faint click of the door behind </p>
            <p>her as it shuts her from the noise of brawling tongues. Yet in her presence, and in
              the memory of her presence, Coriolanus becomes another and a different being. It is
              true we may listen in vain for other words so tender as &lsquo;My gracious
              silence!&rsquo; from his lips. A man who has one love alone finds only one such
              phrase in a lifetime. But in the heat of victorious battle, when Coriolanus would
              clasp Cominius in his arms for joy, he discovers in himself another splendid phrase to
              remember his happiness with Virgilia: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;Oh! let me clip
                ye<lb/> In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart<lb/> As merry, as when our
                nuptial day was done<lb/> And tapers burned to bedward.&rsquo;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>And even in the anguish of the final struggle between his honour and his heart, when
              his wife comes with his mother to intercede for Rome, it is in the very accents of
              passionate devotion that he cries to Virgilia: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;Best of my
                  flesh!<lb rend="RIGHT"/> Forgive my tyranny; but do not say<lb/> For that,
                &ldquo;Forgive our Romans,&rdquo; O! a kiss<lb/> Long as my exile, sweet as
                my revenge!<lb/> Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss<lb/> I carried from
                thee, dear, and my true lip<lb/> Hath virgin'd it e'er since.&rsquo;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the proud, unrelenting man of arms these sudden softenings are wonderful. They
              conjure up the picture of a more reticent and self-suppressed Othello, and we feel
              that to strike to the heart through Coriolanus's coat of mail it needed an unfamiliar
              beauty of soul, a woman whose delicate nature stood untouched apart from the broils
              and furies of her lord's incessant battling with the Roman people or the enemies of
              Rome. </p>

              all mutinous caballers are fully shown in this short scene. The common people are apt
              to impute all national grievances or calamities to the fault of their rulers, tho'
              ever so unavoidable from the nature of things, failure of seasons, or other </p>
            <p>incidental misfortunes whatsoever. If freedom of speech and the liberty of the press
              were not restrained in Turkey, I make no doubt but a Mussulman populace would charge
              the plague to the account of their Sultans or their Viziers. In the same scene that
              abatement of esteem and praise, which is the natural consequence of persons appearing
              to over-rate their own merits, more especially when this is betrayed by showing pride
              or contempt to others, is very justly remarked on.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap"
                >Courtenay</hi> (ii, 212), who cares in general but little for dramatic effect as
              compared with historic accuracy, here remarks that the secession of the Plebeians to
              the Mons Sacer was in protest at the actions of the Patricians and that &lsquo;the
              opening of the play (though placed in a street in Rome) is evidently meant to
              represent this occurrence. But Shakespeare has not followed Plutarch as to the cause
              of this separation, or <hi rend="italic">mutiny,</hi> as he represents it. The dearth
              of corn of which the citizens complain did not occur at this time; the present cause
              of complaint arose of the severe laws of debtor and creditor, which while all the
              wealth was in the hands of the patricians, enabled them to oppress with cruel severity
              those plebeians who had been compelled to become their debtors, and who were
              consequently liable to be claimed as their slaves. And it was on this occasion that
              Menenius Agrippa related the celebrated fable of the Belly and the Members, and also
              that Tribunes of the people were first appointed. The complaint was not of power
              usurped, or arbitrarily used by an aristocracy privileged by birth so much as of
                &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">the rich men</hi> who had driven them out of the city .
              . . and that they were hurt with continual wars and fighting in defence of the <hi
                rend="italic">rich man's goods.</hi>&rdquo; It was the moneyed
              aristo&lt;*&gt;racy by which they were oppressed. And though the old man, in
              the moral of his fable, likens the nourishment afforded by the belly to the wholesome
              counsels of the Senate, yet the fable itself rather describes the possessors of
              wealth, who were said &ldquo;to send it out again for the nourishment of other
              parts.&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Wordsworth</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Hist. Plays,</hi> i, 115): Courtenay's objection [to the locality of
              this scene] is obviated when we consider that Shakespeare has plainly intended to
              combine the two causes of insurrection. See the First Citizen's speech in this scene
              (ll. 81-87). In point of fact, according to Livy, when the second insurrection took
              place (through want of corn) Menenius was dead.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's Sh.</hi>): This first scene is a singularly
              comprehensive introduction. It shows us the political conditions at Rome, focuses
              interest straightway (l. 11) on the protagonist of the tragedy, and illuminates his
              character and motives in a few phrases which practically epitomise what ensues.
              &lsquo;Chief enemy to the people&rsquo;; &lsquo;he pays himself with being
              proud&rsquo;; &lsquo;he did it to please his mother, and to be partly
              proud,&rsquo; these are key-notes, &lsquo;leading motives,&rsquo;
              introduced in the overture and repeated at intervals through the piece. And when
              Coriolanus himself appears we have an immediate example of his pride and enmity to the
              people, and a foreshadowing of that military prowess which accentuates the pitiful
              tragedy of his end.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">E. K. Chambers</hi>: The object of
              the first Act is the glorification of Coriolanus. This is a tragedy; that is,
              essentially, the story of the failure and ruin of a soul which is at least greatly
              planned. In order then that we may be affected tragically the element of greatness in
              Coriolanus must first be established. Coriolanus is, in his way, an idealist; he
              idealizes himself as a man of honour. And in the war with Corioles, which occupies
              scenes iv. to x. of the Act, our attention is directed to those qualities in him which
              justify that ideal, his valour and magnanimity on the field of battle. He is the
              &lsquo;flower of warriors.&rsquo; His defects are lightly touched, not yet
              emphasized. </p>

              Plebeians, in their turbulence and among themselves, can only give vent to their lust
              for revolt in a form of prose, which in the mouth of the first Citizen, as spokesman
              of the crowd, has a somewhat euphuistic tinge. Menenius, who as chief humorist of the
              drama in another scene speaks in prose, must here, as intercessor, guard his cultured
              authority when confronting the great rabble and speak in blank verse, in which also
              the spokesman citizen replies in his dispute with Menenius. </p>

              Sh.</hi>): The name is so given in North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> (1579). The
              deplorable habit of &lsquo;emending&rsquo; and modernizing is evident in
              Rowe's change to <hi rend="italic">Marcius,</hi> ever since followed, obscuring
              Shakespeare's source for this and other forms of spelling. [Reference to the <hi
                rend="italic">Text. Notes</hi> will show that Theobald, and not Rowe, is responsible
              for the change in spelling. Theobald's classical knowledge evidently did not permit
              the use of the Latin adjective <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> (of, or belonging to,
              Mars) when the name of the Latin gens Marcius was required. In a letter to Warburton,
              dated Feb. 12, 1729-30, he says: &lsquo;The succeeding editions will do well, I
              think, to write <hi rend="smallcap">Marcius</hi>, for the family name was <foreign

                <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> by North, and so also by Holland in his translation
              of Livy. Possibly this was due to Italian influence on the English spelling of Latin
              names at that period.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              Coriolanus, as though to link the two characters indissolubly together, and when we
              examine the great tragedy we find them so closely connected that any study of the one
              must needs include the other. Volumnia's daily thoughts, her joys and sorrows, the
              whole work of her life are so centred in her only son that she can hardly be said to
              have any existence independent of him, while if he has a separate life of his own,
              most of his faults, and many of his gifts, are either inherited from her, or have been

              &lsquo;waving other objections that might be made to them, neither of them agrees
              with the context. The speaker sets out with ascribing all Marcius&rsquo; actions

              with this slight difference&mdash;that perhaps indeed the pleasing his mother

              forth the degree of his pride&mdash;that it was a full balance to all his virtues,
              however great they might be. And this being the Author's intention in the speeches

              partial method of procedure which does not solve the problem or even touch it, And is
              not justified by Any sound principle of criticism. At the same time the retention of
              All the Abbreviations except <hi rend="italic">th'</hi> indicates An imperfect
              recognition of what was Shakespeare's ideal of dramatic verse&mdash;the ideal At
              which he was Aiming Almost from the first, And to which in the end he Absolutely
              Attained in the incomparable versification of <hi rend="italic">Ant. &amp;
              Cleo.</hi> Yet Attention has Actually been drawn to &ldquo;the irregular verse of
              the later plays.&rdquo; The result is that the most perfect of All dramatic verse
              has been systematically travestied; its native freedom is hampered As by fetters. As
              left by their Author, the measures moved with the lightness And ease and rhythmic
              grace of A beautiful And elaborate dance, And they made music to the ear. Read As we
              must read them, they stump About As it were in clogs; their grace is gone And the
              music is &ldquo;beastly dumb'd.&rdquo; Consequently, the enjoyment of A play
              At home is marred by An irritation which grows in proportion to the beauty of the
              verse that is distorted, And in the theatre the Actors Are compelled to vex our ears
              And their own with halting measures that have no balance, and to deliver much of the
              finest of All drama in A jargon that is unworthy both of the Author And themselves.
              This cobbled patch work is given to us for Shakespeare's verse As he was satisfied to
              leave it, And while it is proclaimed with simple truth that he is the world's greatest
              poet, it has been found necessary to beg us to make Allowances&mdash;yes, to <hi

              persuasions And gentle requests made to the people on the behalf of the
              senate,&rsquo; And puts in his mouth the &lsquo;notable tale&rsquo; of the
              belly's rebellion Against the members of the human body [<hi rend="italic">sic.</hi>
              &lsquo;Aliquando dormitat,&rsquo; etc.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Ed.</hi>]. But Menenius disappears from Plutarch's page As soon As he has drawn his
              moral from this Apologue. He retires As soon As he has proved in parable that the
              senate is to the body politic what the belly is to the human frame. Shakespeare
              prolongs Menenius' history to the end of the piece. Throughout the tragedy he is A
              level-headed observer of events. He criticizes their progress with ironical detachment
              After the manner of A chorus in classical tragedy. His place in the dramatic scheme
              resembles that of Enobarbus in <hi rend="italic">Antony &amp; Cleopatra,</hi> And
              the turn of events involves him in Almost As melancholy A fate. He is no bitter
              partisan, And Although Associated with the patricians has the reputation of loving the
              people. He jests As complacently At what he conceives to be his own failings As At
              those which he detects in others. His ironical wit sharpens the zest of his sagacious
              comments until the cruel catastrophe of Coriolanus's repudiation. Then his spirit
              breaks And despair overwhelms him. There is no more pathetic episode in the tragedy
              than Coriolanus' dismissal of him, practically unheard, from the Volscian camp. Not
              the newly crowned Prince Hal's rejection of his old Associate Falstaff inflicts A
              deeper wound on the reader's, or the spectator's, heart. [For various estimates of the

              this movement which the plebeians conducted so moderately and sagaciously to a
              successful end has passed into the picture of Shakespeare. He ignores the
              reasonableness of their cause, the reasonableness of their means, and fails to
              perceive the essential efficiency and steadiness of their character, though all these
              things are expressed or implied in Plutarch's narrative. This episode in which the
              younger contemporary of Nero favours the people, the elder contemporary of Pym
              summarily dismisses, and substitutes for it another far less important, in which they
              appear in no very creditable light, but which had nothing to do with the institution
              of the Tribunate, and occurred in consequence of the dearth only after the capture of
              Corioli. &lsquo;Now those busie pratlers . . . spread abroad false tales and
              rumours against the Nobilitie, that they in revenge of the people had practised and
              procured the extreme dearthe among them.&rsquo; This circumstance, combined with
              the still later demand for a distribution of corn, Shakespeare transposes, and makes
              the surely rather inappropriate cause of the appointment of the Tribunes.
              Inappropriate, that is, to what the logic of the situation requires, and to what the
              sagacity of the traditional plebs would solicit. They ask for bread and they get a
              magistrate. But not inappropriate to the unreasoning demands of a frenzied
              proletariat. Many parallels might be cited from the French revolutions. But this is
              just an instance of Shakespeare's inability to conceive a popular rising in other
              terms than the outbreak of a mob. </p>

              <hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 529): Shakespeare not only completely
              suppresses the remarkable secession to the Mons Sacer, but barely mentions the social
              grievances that led to it. The Citizen says, indeed, of the Patricians [ll. 83-86];
              but this is a mere passing remark, and no stress is laid on these the real causes of
              the discontent, in comparison with the dearth, which for the rest seems to end with
              the Coriolun campaign, when there is, as Cominius promises, a &lsquo;common
              distribution&rsquo; of the spoils. Now the dearth is represented as a mere
              disastrous accident for which no one is responsible, and for which there is no remedy
              save prayer&mdash;or such a foray as presently took place. Menenius expressly says
              so [ll. 74-76]. It is alleged, no doubt, by the mutineers that the &lsquo;store
              houses are crammed with grain,&rsquo; but there is no confirmation of this in the
              play, and the way in which &lsquo;honest&rsquo; Menenius reports the rumour,
              and Marcius, who is never less than honest, receives it, implies that it is mere

                >E. J. White</hi> (p. 405): A statute is generally defined as a law enacted by the
              legislative power, or a written expression of the legislative will, in the form
              necessary to make it the law of the state or country where it is to obtain. The Poet
              many times speaks of &lsquo;biting statutes&rsquo; and &lsquo;piercing
              statutes,&rsquo; showing that he had the lawyers&rsquo; regard for such strict
              legislative provisions as made it hard upon the individual citizen, when enforced,
              with the Poet's sympathy for the individual in any hardship that he suffered, even
              though it resulted from the enforcement of the law. Speaking of the repeal of such
              statutes as were enacted for the benefit of the poor, the idea is that such acts were
              rendered migratory by inconsistent provisions, by which an implied repeal of a
              previous statute may be effected. The legal observations in these lines are made in
              strict accord with the struggle then going on, between the plebeians and the
              patricians, for supremacy, and show an accurate knowledge not only of the legal
              requirements of legislative enactments but also of the historical facts existing at
              this period of the world's history. </p>

                Morall Philosopie of Doni,</hi> translated by Sir Thomas North, 1570 (ed. Jacobs, p.
              64), this fable of the belly and members is related, and it is prefaced with these
              words: &lsquo;That noble Romaine that fought and laboured to bring the people and
              communaltie to loue their Magistrates and superiours, tolde them a pretie tale (to
              write it happilye in this Booke for him that knoweth it not) howe the handes were
              angrie with the bodie.&rsquo; It is, however, not necessary to transcribe the rest
              of the fable as there given; it is in no way like to that in other collections. The
              writer thus concludes: &lsquo;With this pretie tale he made the people sensibly to
              vnderstand what became them, and how they should behave themselves to their
              superiours.&rsquo; We have no possible means of knowing whether Shakespeare either
              knew of or had ever seen this particular version of the story, but that it should be
              therein twice referred to as &lsquo;a pretty tale&rsquo; and that same phrase
              be used by Shakespeare are points which would seem to indicate at least a recollection

              <hi rend="smallcap">Theobald</hi>: Thus all the editions, but without any manner of
              sense that I can find out. The Poet must have wrote as I have corrected the text [see

              &lsquo;Perhaps you may have heard my tale already, but for all that, I'll venture
              to make it more <hi rend="italic">stale</hi> and familiar to you by telling it over
              again.&rsquo; And nothing is more common than the verb in this sense with our
              three capital dramatic Poets. To begin with our own Author: &lsquo;Age cannot

              &ldquo;scale&rdquo;; and so the editors of 1778. The same misprint occurs in

              carefully retained in the three latest editions of the great dramatist, though
              Theobald had long ago corrected the passage, and though Gifford in a most decisive
              note had proved that the true reading is <hi rend="italic">stale.</hi>&rsquo; (See

              Neither of Dr Warburton's examples afford a sense congruous to the present occasion.
              In the passage quoted to &lsquo;scale&rsquo; may be to weigh and compare, but
              where do we find that to &lsquo;scale&rsquo; is to apply? If we <hi
                rend="italic">scale</hi> the two critics, I think Theobald has the
                advantage.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Capell</hi> (vol. I, pt i, p. 81)
              characterises Theobald's alteration as &lsquo;a most certain
              correction,&rsquo; and remarks that &lsquo;&ldquo;scale't,&rdquo; <hi
                rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> weigh or examine it, is neither pertinent to the matter in

              >Steevens</hi>: To &lsquo;scale&rsquo; is to <hi rend="italic">disperse.</hi>
              The word is used in the North. If emendation was at all necessary, Theobald's is as
              good a one as could be proposed. The sense of the old reading is: Though some of you
              have heard the story, I will spread it yet wider, and impart it to the rest. A measure
              of wine spilt is called &lsquo;a scal'd pottle of wine&rsquo; in Dekker's
              comedy, <hi rend="italic">The Honest Whore,</hi> 1635. So in <hi rend="italic">The
                Hystorie of Clyomen,</hi> a play published in 1599: &lsquo;[Ah sirrah, now] the
              hugy heapes of cares that lodged in my minde Are scaled from their nestling-place, and
              pleasures passage find,&rsquo; [Peele's Works, ed. Dyce, iii, 78. Steevens gives
              three other examples of &lsquo;scale&rsquo; used in the sense <hi

                rend="italic">Translation of Virgil;</hi> and in later editions he added several
              more. Gifford, who seldom let slip an opportunity to gird at Steevens, says, in a note
              on the line, &lsquo;I'll not stale the jest By my relation&rsquo; (Massinger,
                <hi rend="italic">The Unnatural Combat,</hi> IV, ii, p. 203). &lsquo;This is one
              of a thousand instances which might be brought to prove that the true reading in <hi
                rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is: &ldquo;To stale't a little more.&rdquo; .
              . . Steevens prefers <hi rend="italic">scale,</hi> which he proves from a variety of
              learned authorities to mean <hi rend="italic">scatter, disperse, spread;</hi> to make
              any of them, however, suit his purpose, he is obliged to give an unfaithful version of

                rend="italic">the rest!</hi>&rdquo; There is nothing of this in Shakespeare;
              and, indeed, I cannot avoid looking on his long note as a feeble attempt to justify a
              palpable error of the press, at the cost of taste and sense.&rsquo; Gifford, in
              his edition of Jonson published ten years later, in a note on the line in <hi

                rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> which has happily furnished occasion for much
              perverse ingenuity to justify the poet's adoption of a word which he would steadily

              believe Theobald is right. In the passage which Warburton quotes from <hi

              >stale</hi> is the right reading, and that <hi rend="italic">scale</hi> was introduced
              in that passage, as I believe it was into this, by a mistake of the printer's.
              Steevens has proved beyond doubt that to <hi rend="italic">scale</hi> meant formerly
              to <hi rend="italic">disperse;</hi> but the remark of Menenius, that though perhaps
              his audience had heard it before, he would venture to tell his tale again, convinces
              me that <hi rend="italic">stale</hi> is the true reading.&mdash;<hi

              significations of the word &lsquo;scale&rsquo; in English and other languages
              Tooke declares that all of these have but one meaning in common: viz., &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">Divided, Separated.</hi> The tale of Menenius was &ldquo;scaled a
              little more&rdquo; by being divided into particulars and degrees, told more
              circumstantially and at length. That, I take, to be Shakespeare's meaning by the
              expression, and not the <hi rend="italic">staling</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
              >diffusing</hi> of the tale, which, if they had heard it before, could not have been
              done by his repetition. For Menenius does not say that <hi rend="italic">some</hi> of
              them had heard it before; that word <hi rend="italic">some</hi> is introduced by Mr
              Steevens in his note merely to give a colour to his explanation of &ldquo;<hi

              Warburton, conveys the true meaning of the following passages: &lsquo;By this is
              your brother saved, the poor Mariana advantaged, and the correct [<hi rend="italic"

              it is manifest: &lsquo;Scaling his present bearing with his past,&rsquo; II,
              iii, 261, and this has the more force, as occurring soon after in the same play. That
              it does also mean to separate and fly off, as <hi rend="italic">scales</hi> fly from
              heated metal, is proved by the passages which Mr Steevens cites for that purpose. The
              other passages adduced are hardly relevant, and the Scottish dialect will not often
              authorise English words.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Brockett</hi> (s. v. <hi

              scale't.&rsquo; I am quite satisfied that it was the author's intention to have
              the tale <hi rend="italic">spread</hi> a little more minutely; or, as Horne Tooke
              better expresses it, to have it divided into more particulars and degrees, told more

              on this passage, and on the means of acquiring a competent knowledge of the old
              English tongue (<hi rend="italic">Notes on the Battle of Flodden</hi>), I entertain a
              hope that the learned author of the elaborate and valuable Glossary may not be
              indisposed to alter in more respects than one the article, <hi rend="italic">To
              Scale,</hi> in a future edition.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Knight</hi>: It is
              necessary to see how Shakspere has used this verb [to scale] in other passages. In the
              second act Sicinius tells the citizens: &lsquo;Scaling his present bearing with
              his past, That he's your fixed enemy.&rsquo; Dr Johnson explains this:
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Weighing</hi> his past and present
              behaviour.&rsquo; This interpretation seems obvious and natural; and none of the
              commentators object to it with reference to this particular passage. But in <hi
                rend="italic">Meas. for Meas.,</hi> when the Duke explains his project to Isabella,
              he says, &lsquo;by this . . . is the corrupt deputy <hi rend="italic"
              >scaled,</hi>&rsquo; [III, i, 266]. Upon this passage Johnson says: &lsquo;To
                <hi rend="italic">scale</hi> the deputy may be to reach him, or it may be to strip
              him.&rsquo; Here he differs from his interpretation of the passage in <hi
                rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi> But surely &lsquo;the corrupt deputy&rsquo;
              may be &lsquo;scaled&rsquo; in the same way that the bearing of Coriolanus is
              &lsquo;scaled.&rsquo; We have precisely the same meaning in the
              Scriptures&mdash;&lsquo;Weighed in the balance, and found wanting.&rsquo;
              If this interpretation be good for two of the passages, why not for a third, that of
              the present passage before us? Menenius will venture to <hi rend="italic">weigh,</hi>
              to try the value, of the &lsquo;pretty tale&rsquo; a little more; though they
              may have heard it, he will again <hi rend="italic">scale</hi> it. . . . Horne Tooke's
              explanation of all these passages appears to us somewhat fanciful, and assumes that
              Shakspere uses the same word in different places under different meanings that can
              only be reconciled by an </p>
            <p>etymological reference.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> in his ed. i.
              follows the Folio reading and accepts (without acknowledgment) Steevens's
              interpretation that &lsquo;scale&rsquo; here means <hi rend="italic">to
                disperse,</hi> which, as he says, may be shown by many examples. This and the
              foregoing note by Knight called forth a characteristic &lsquo;Remark&rsquo;
              from <hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi> (p. 158) to the effect that such
              &lsquo;blundering&rsquo; was &lsquo;really piteous,&rsquo; since the
              correct reading, <hi rend="italic">stale,</hi> had long since been restored by
              Theobald. Dyce then quotes in full Gifford's note on the line from Massinger's <hi
                rend="italic">Unnatural Combat</hi> (see <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>) and adds
              several other quotations wherein <hi rend="italic">stale</hi> is used as a verb
              signifying <hi rend="italic">to make common.</hi> Collier in his ed. ii. declares that
              he yields &lsquo;to the weight of authority that &ldquo;scale&rdquo; of
              the old copies ought to be <hi rend="italic">stale,</hi> although the corrected Folio
              of 1632 has no such emendation.&rsquo; He then concludes his note thus:
              &lsquo;The Rev. Mr Dyce takes abundant pains to prove that to
              &ldquo;stale&rdquo; means to make stale, a point nobody disputed, the only
              question being whether <hi rend="italic">scale</hi> was a misprint in the Folio, 1623;
              we think it was, and so treat it. In his enumeration of places, where to <hi
                rend="italic">stale</hi> means to make stale or familiar, the Rev. Mr Dyce strangely
              forgot the most apposite instance, viz., in the address of the stationer to the
              reader, before <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida,</hi> 4 to 1609, where he says
              that it had never been &ldquo;staled with the stage.&rdquo; The recollection
              of this fact would have spared Mr Dyce a great deal of useless labour in making and
              repeating <hi rend="italic">stale</hi> quotations.&rsquo;&mdash;A Parthian
              shot which rendered his doughty antagonist quite speechless. Knight likewise, in his
              ed. ii, 1867, rather than again be accused of &lsquo;piteous
              blundering,&rsquo; yielded to the weight of authority marshalled by Dyce and
              accepted Theobald's emendation.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Halliwell</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dict. of Archaisms,</hi> s. v. <hi

                <hi rend="italic">Remarks,</hi> p. 158. The observations of Brockett on this
              passage, which he quite misunderstands, lead me to observe that, with a few trifling
              exceptions, the very worst annotations on Shakespeare have proceeded from the
              compilers of provincial glossaries, to whom the philological student would be more
              deeply indebted if they would conf&lt;*&gt;e themselves to the correct

              Some editors interpret &lsquo;scale,&rsquo; to disperse; but granting the word
              that meaning, what sense does it afford in the place it holds? Menenius tells the
              people that it may be that they have heard his story, <hi rend="italic">but,</hi>
              since it serves his purpose, he will venture to use it, old as it is, and make it even
                <hi rend="italic">staler.</hi> Can there be the least doubt that Theobald was right
              in changing one letter and reading as in the text?&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              then the sense does not suit the passage, while the sense of <hi rend="italic"
              >stale</hi> suits it admirably. <hi rend="italic">Stale</hi> is also a word of which
              Shakespeare is fond, while no other instance can be produced of his having used the
              rare word &lsquo;scale.&rsquo; All persons conversant with the written
              characters of any age know that there are letters which are easily confounded, the
              forms of the literal elements having been as little the subject of reflection and
              science as the sounds of which they are the representatives. This correction . . . is

                rend="italic">to weigh;</hi> he goes somewhat further than Tooke in twisting a

              meaning he applies to the present passage, that from <hi rend="italic">Meas. for
              Meas.</hi> already quoted by Nares, and the second passage in <hi rend="italic"
                >Coriol.;</hi> he thus concludes his elucidation: &lsquo;This meaning suits all
              our three passages. The corrupt deputy will be unmasked, exposed, discerned. Menenius
              proposes to look a little more deeply into the inner meaning of the fable which all
              his hearers have heard, but not discerned before. The people have found, taking the
              behaviour of Coriolanus to pieces and scrutinizing it carefully, present and past
              together, that under the covering of compliance the old hate still rankles.&rsquo;
              [Gifford found grave fault with Steevens for a sophistication of the text to suit his
              own interpretation of the word &lsquo;scale&rsquo;; but what shall be said of
              such an utter perversion of the meaning and drift of the passage as this by Whitelaw?
              Schmidt, retaining the Folio reading in his text, declares that Whitelaw's explanation
              is to be preferred to all the others, and that the emendation <hi rend="italic"
              >stale</hi> is, therefore, to be unconditionally rejected, since it conveys an utterly
              false idea of what Menenius intends, which is not to render the fable more familiar,
              but to apply it more nearly to the present occasion, and make more striking its inner
              meaning. Schmidt is, I think, here misled by Whitelaw's flow of words and has not
              sufficiently paid attention to the sentence preceding. Menenius does <hi rend="italic"
                >not</hi> say that although his hearers may have heard the fable before, he intends
              to make it clearer to them, what he expressly states is: although you may have heard
              this, I am going to risk (&lsquo;venture&rsquo;) to make it a little more
                familiar.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">B.
                Nicholson</hi> (<hi rend="italic">N. &amp; Q.,</hi> May 4, 1878, p. 342):
              Theobald's change is a very plausible one, the more that it substitutes a phrase more
              in use with and more understood by modern readers than the one that is somewhat
              antiquated. The rule, however, is beginning to be better understood (except by some
              emending critics) that a change which the emender believes to be an improvement is not
              to be adopted if the old reading gives a sufficient sense. Here, I believe, it gives
              not only a sufficient, but a better sense. To &lsquo;scale a fish&rsquo; is to
              disfurnish, or clear, or clean it from its scales that it may be used by man. To
              &lsquo;scale a piece of old and rusty metal&rsquo; is to clear off its rusty
              scaling, and so furbish it up anew for use or ornament. To &lsquo;scale a
              bone,&rsquo; as practised by the old surgeons, was to scrape off the diseased
              surface, and so clear or clean it. The ordinary supposition (founded on the reading
                <hi rend="italic">stale't</hi>) is that Menenius only intends to say that
              &lsquo;he will tell the tale again.&rsquo; But he does not merely do this nor
              intend to do it. What he intends to do, and afterwards does do, is intimated in the
              words &lsquo;but since it serves my purpose.&rsquo; In accordance therewith he
              not only tells the tale but also takes </p>
            <p>off the covering and lays bare its meaning, or moral to their use, or, to use other
              synonyms, clears it, or shells it open to their apprehensions, that they may see and
              taste it in all its goodness. Nor are we without contemporary examples of a similar
              use of the word. A very pertinent one is to be found in James I.'s <hi rend="italic"
                >D&aelig;monologie,</hi> a work probably read by Shakspere, though the royal
              author may not be complimented on his collocation of terms: &lsquo;The brightness
              of the Gospell . . . scaled [= cleared off] the cloudes of grosse errors, [<hi
                rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> all these gross clouds of error]&rsquo; (bk. ii, ch.
              vii, p. 53, first ed.). This example is sufficient for the reinstatement of
              &lsquo;scale&rsquo; as Shakspere's word. Richardson in his <hi rend="italic"
                >Dictionary,</hi> following Skinner, also reads &lsquo;scale&rsquo; in this

              explain it as signifying to strip the fable of its scale, or shell, or outer

                rend="italic">stale</hi> gives admirable sense. Shakespeare uses the word in four

              &lsquo;It will be seen,&rsquo; Miss Porter adds, &lsquo;that this word

              would induce him to follow Theobald; for though he admits it is not impossible that
              Shakespeare may have written <hi rend="italic">stale't,</hi> it is bad editing to
              strike out what already makes excellent sense and to &lsquo;re-write
              Shakespeare.&rsquo; Now with regard to the verb <hi rend="italic">scale,</hi>
              first let us remember that Shakespeare often uses words in a somewhat licentious
              sense, bending them without scruple to one that pleases him. It is not impossible that
              the idea in his mind may have been to ventilate, air, disperse, with a sort of play on
              the sense &lsquo;weigh in scales,&rsquo; a sense which the word bears in II,
              iii, 261 <hi rend="italic">post.</hi> This sort of thing he has done often: <hi
                rend="italic">Mid. N. Dream,</hi> I, i, 131, where it is most likely that he uses
              &lsquo;between&rsquo; in the double sense of </p>

                >set,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">starry.</hi> Steevens gives several examples of
              &lsquo;scale&rsquo; in the sense of <hi rend="italic">disperse.</hi> [Craig
              here quotes these as the concluding paragraph of his note. Craig's untimely death
              prevented the completion of his editing this play; that task was ably undertaken by R.
              H. Case, who here states that the Folio reading is retained solely out of deference to
              the intention of the original editor, and upon that intention remarks: &lsquo;Mr
              Craig pleads for, and acts on, a good principle; but I feel bound to point out the
              words &ldquo;some of&rdquo; which Steevens slips into his interpretation to
              give it probability have no warrant from Shakespeare. Menenius speaks to <hi
                rend="italic">all</hi> the citizens present: &ldquo;Either you must confess
              yourselves . . . I shall tell you a pretty tale; it may be you have heard
              it,&rdquo; and assumes his story to be possibly known to all. Hence, to enable him
              to scale or diffuse it, we should have to assume that in saying &ldquo;it may be
              you have heard it,&rdquo; he suddenly and pointedly addresses the First Citizen
              only; we cannot turn <hi rend="italic">you</hi> into <hi rend="italic">some of
              you</hi> to please Steevens.&rsquo; Bradley (<hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi>)
              under the various meanings of the verb <hi rend="italic">to scale</hi> does not
              include that first given by Steevens, <hi rend="italic">to disperse;</hi> we may,
              therefore, conclude that the editor regarded such a restricted meaning as one that
              belonged to a language other than English. Bradley does, however, give two examples of
                <hi rend="italic">scale</hi> in the sense of <hi rend="italic">weighed,
              estimated,</hi> both of them from Shakespeare. The first, that line from <hi
                rend="italic">Meas. for Meas.</hi> already quoted by several commentators in the
              foregoing notes, and the other that line still more often quoted from the second Act,
              third scene, of this play. Finally, the remarks of Hunter and, in particular, those of
              Walker in regard to the confusion which might easily arise from the similarity of the
              written characters <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> would seem
              to be almost conclusive in favour of Theobald's emendation. As the majority have
              accepted this, after weighing all the evidence, it is likewise accepted by the present

              (ii, 76): It is rather extraordinary that none of Shakespeare's commentators should
              have noticed the skilful manner in which he has diversified and expanded the
              well-known apologue of <hi rend="italic">the belly and the members,</hi> the origin of
              which it may be neither unentertaining nor unprofitable to investigate, as well as the
              manner in which it has been used, and by whom. The composition has been generally
              ascribed to Menenius Agrippa; but as it occurs in a very ancient collection of
              &AElig;sopian fables, there may be as much reason </p>
            <p>for supposing it the invention of &AElig;sop as there is for making him the
              parent of many others. The first person who has introduced Menenius as reciting this
              fable is Dionysius of Halicarnassus [25 B. C.], book vi. Then follow Livy, lib. ii.;
              Plutarch, in the life of Coriolanus; Florus, lib. i, cap. xxiii; each of whom gives it
              in his own manner. During the middle ages there appeared a collection of Latin fables
              in hexameter verse that has agitated the opinions of the learned to little purpose in
              their endeavors to ascertain the real name of the compiler or versifier. He has been
              called Romulus, Accius, and Salo. Nor is the time when he lived at all known. These
              fables are sometimes called <hi rend="italic">anonymous,</hi> and have been published
              in various forms. An excellent edition by Nilant appeared in 1709, 12mo. Many of them
              were translated into French verse in the eleventh century by a French lady who calls
              herself <hi rend="italic">Marie de France,</hi> in which form they have been happily
              preserved with many others extremely curious composed by the same ingenious person. .
              . . William Herman of Gouda, in Holland, reduced them into Latin prose about the year
              1500, omitting some and adding others. The works of Romulus and Herman of Gouda have
              been published in a great variety of forms and languages, and constitute the set of
              &AElig;sopian fables which commences with that of the cock and the precious stone;
              in all which the apologue of the belly and the members is to be found, and sometimes
              with considerable variation. . . . Nor was this fable unknown in the Eastern world.
              Syntipas, a Persian fabulist, has placed it in his work, published for the first time
              from a MS. at Moscow, by Matth&aelig;us, Lips. 1781, 8vo. Lafontaine has related
              it in his own inimitable manner; and, lastly, the editor of Baskerville and Dodsley's
                <hi rend="italic">&AElig;sop</hi> has given it in a style not inferior perhaps
              to that of any of his predecessors. [See, also, note by <hi rend="smallcap"
              >Douce,</hi> l. 144 <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Jacobs</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Fables of &AElig;sop,</hi> i, 82): There is a
              reference in the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata</hi> (xiv, 688) to a fable similar to
                <hi rend="italic">The Belly and Members</hi> which deserves closer attention, as it
              is, in many ways, the most remarkable fable in existence. A variant of it, or
              something very like it, was discovered six years ago by M. Maspero in a fragmentary
              papyrus, which he dates about the twentieth dynasty (c. 1250 B. C.). It is,
              consequently, the oldest fable in existence. . . . The fable, if fable it can be
              called, takes the form of a mock-trial, corresponding, as M. Gaston Paris has pointed
              out, to the <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;bat</hi> which is so familiar in
              medi&aelig;val French literature. From this point of view the <hi rend="italic"
                >d&eacute;bat</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Belly and Head</hi> affords us the
              earliest example of legal procedure extant. We again meet with the fable in the <hi
                rend="italic">Upanishads,</hi> whence it doubtless got into the <hi rend="italic"
                >Mahabharata,</hi> and perhaps too into the <hi rend="italic">Zend Yacna: Dispute of
                the Senses and the Soul</hi>. . . . A similar apologue existed among the Buddhists
              as we know from the fact that it exists in the Chinese Buddhistic work <hi
                rend="italic">Avadanas</hi> (No. 105); it occurs also in the <hi rend="italic"
                >Pantschatantra: The Bird with Two Heads.</hi> I have also found a Jewish variant,
              though with a somewhat different moral: <hi rend="italic">The Tongue and the
              Members.</hi> But there is a still more striking use of the fable by a Jew. There can
              be little doubt that St. Paul had a similar fable in his mind in the characteristic
              passage (<hi rend="italic">1 Cor.,</hi> xii, 12-26). The passage combines the Indian
              idea of the contest of the members with the Roman notion of the body politic. As this
              passage is the foundation of the doctrine of the Visible Church, and indirectly of the
              conception of the Body Politic (of which Hobbes made such quaint use), we cannot well
              overrate the importance of the fable on which it is founded. We have thus seen this
              fable of the Body and its Members with its Belgian motto, <hi rend="italic">L'union
                fait la force,</hi> forming </p>
            <p>part of the sacred literature of Egyptians and Chinese, of Brahmins, Buddhists and
              Magians, of Jews, and Christians. The reader must not, however, assume that these are
              all necessarily derived from one source. . . . The various versions [afford] an
              instructive example of how different nations may hit upon the very same apologue to
              illustrate the same idea. Carefully examined, the various versions may be reduced to
              four independent ones. The Egyptian <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;bat</hi> stands by
              itself, the Brahmin <hi rend="italic">Contest of Senses and Soul,</hi> occurring in
              the <hi rend="italic">Upanishads,</hi> recurs in the Indian epic, in the Persian
              scripture, and possibly through the latter, in Jewish commentaries, and may thence
              have influenced St. Paul. The lost Buddhist apologue of <hi rend="italic">The Bird
                with Two Heads</hi> found its way to China, and was received into the Bidpai
              literature. The Roman fable is remarkable as being the only fable of its kind in Latin
              literature which can claim to be current among the Romans. It occurs late, and may
              have been interpolated by Livy, like so much of his work. But, on the whole, I am
              inclined to regard it as a genuine Roman folk-fable and another instance of the
              sporadic use of the fable . . . by nations who have not otherwise shown a turn towards
              that form of the apologue. The whole enquiry ought to make us careful in the future
              how we admit borrowing without sure evidence either of identity of the fables or of
              contact between the nations using them. [See <hi rend="italic">Appendix: Fable of the
                Belly and the Members.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi

              people that would not lend; his hero, in the witty classification of men into those
              who borrow and those who lend, decidedly belonging to the former category, and being

              <hi rend="smallcap">R. G. White</hi>: According to modern British usage Shakespeare is

              &lsquo;Shop&rsquo; means properly a place where fabrics are made or work is
              done; and such is the sense in which it is always used with us, but in Great Britain
              it is rarely so applied, and is almost universally misused to mean a store or
              collection of articles kept or stored for sale&mdash;a confusion avoided in
              Elizabethan usage and of that in the present day in this country. Thus, for instance,
              we say a watchmaker's shop, a milliner's shop, . . . but a book store, a grocery
              store, . . . a shoemaker's shop, but a shoe store. . . . The transatlantic use of the

              Q. Serenus Sammonicus, a physician in the reign of Caracalla, that allude to the

              &lsquo;Perhaps there was never a more perverse and impertinent attempt made to
              alter the true language of the poet. The authority Shakespeare followed for the fable
              was Plutarch. [In] Camden's <hi rend="italic">Remaines,</hi> where it is also related,
              the <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> is made the seat of the <hi rend="italic">brain,</hi>
              or understanding; and there is no doubt that <hi rend="italic">seat</hi> means the <hi

              &ldquo;cranks&rdquo; to <hi rend="italic">ranks</hi> is equally unwarranted.
              What could <hi rend="italic">the ranks</hi> signify here? &ldquo;Cranks and <hi
                rend="italic">offices</hi>&rdquo; were certainly the words of the poet;

              of the use of &lsquo;digest&rsquo; in the abstract sense; but it is, in
              reality, a gross misprision of the true meaning of the passage, and is only another
              proof of how far we are still from possessing a correctly printed edition of
              Shakespeare. The proper punctuation would be this: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;The

              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>&lsquo;For examine&rsquo; is introduced merely to diversify the discourse and
              to fix the attention of the listeners; it might be wholly omitted without injury to
              the sense, but in the passage, as it now stands, &lsquo;examine&rsquo; is made
              an effective verb, having for its objects the counsels and the cares of the senators,
              while &lsquo;digest&rsquo; is made auxiliary to and synonymous with
              &lsquo;examine,&rsquo; and, like it, is in the imperative mood, as though
              addressed to the people, instead of being, as it ought to be, in the indicative, with
              &lsquo;counsels&rsquo; and &lsquo;cares&rsquo; for its agents. It is a
              curious instance of how completely the true sense of a passage may be distorted by the
              misapplication of a few commas. &lsquo;Digest,&rsquo; therefore, in this
              passage, as elsewhere, is in direct allusion to the animal function. The very essence
              and pith of the parable of &lsquo;the belly and the members&rsquo; is to place
              in opposition the <hi rend="italic">digestive</hi> function of the belly with the more
              active offices of the members; and the application of the parable is that
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">the senators</hi> are this good belly,&rsquo; <hi
                rend="italic">their</hi> counsels and <hi rend="italic">their</hi> cares <hi

              benefits throughout the whole community. This is the true reading; and no person who
              duly considers it, or who has compared it with the original in Plutarch, but must be
              satisfied that it is so. [See also note by A. E. Brae on III, i, 158.] </p>

              fact, they were starving, while the &lsquo;members&rsquo; of the body, on

              well the intelligence of his audience, and that they would not be likely to detect the
              flaws in his argument either here or at l. 155, as shown by Beeching. Had it not been
              so, the Citizen might easily have turned the whole of Menenius's fable against him by
              showing that, in the present situation, although actually in rebellion, the Citizens
              were more like to the Belly, in the fable, and the Senate to the limbs, than as

              has learnt one of the arts of the public speaker, to single out the most prominent of
              his interrupters and disconcert him by making him ridiculous. But, on the whole, his
              speech has not been a success. In North his persuasions &lsquo;pacified the
              people&rsquo;; in Shakespeare they have no effect. The whole episode only serves
              to bring out the complete divergence between the noble and the plebeian points of
              view. And one feels that the Citizen, who has shown a good deal of shrewd common
              sense, and has escaped all the pitfalls of Menenius' dialectic, has really had the
              best of it. Menenius' argument, when analysed, is only the ordinary sophistry by which
              the middlemen and the unproductive classes generally justify to themselves their own
              appropriation of nine-tenths of the profits of industry. </p>
            <p>It is very plausible, but not calculated to convince a starving
              proletariate.&mdash; [The observation by Chambers that the persuasions of Menenius
              have no effect is one that must be apparent to any reader or auditor, and if to us,
              how much more so must it have been to Shakespeare with his abundant knowledge of
              dramatic construction. That he realised how difficult was the task before him is shown
              at the beginning of the colloquy where the Citizen says that Menenius must not think
              &lsquo;to fob off their disgraces with a tale.&rsquo; Menenius does attempt
              it, but does not succeed in making the mob put down their weapons and quietly
              disperse, a course of action, on so slight a cause, which Shakespeare rightly realised
              would be perfectly inconsistent with a crowd in such an ugly mood, bent on
              destruction. All that Menenius accomplishes is to delay their precipitate action. It
              can hardly be said, therefore, that this fable is here without any dramatic
                effect.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

                rend="italic">Hunting,</hi> p. 339, foot-note): Shakespeare's use of the word
              [rascal] is peculiar: &lsquo;Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest
              deer hath them as huge as the rascal.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italic">As You
                Like It,</hi> III, iii, 58. [The present line here quoted.] Reading these quotations
              together with the speech of John Talbot [<hi rend="italic">1 Henry VI:</hi> IV, ii,
              48] it is plain that Shakespeare conceived of &lsquo;rascal&rsquo; as a deer
              with a great head and a small body, who would neither fight nor run. Such deer though
              not unknown are very uncommon, though it is by no means unusual for a deer past his
              prime to carry an inferior head on a very large body. Shakespeare's rascal would be at
              a great disadvantage, for deer fight by shoving before they come to goring; and here
              the light weight of his body would place him at the mercy of a stag of heavier frame.
              Moreover, the enormous mass of bone upon his head, . . . with no sufficient strength
              of body to carry it, would make such a deer weak and helpless. Hence the legitimate
              conclusion that he could neither run far nor fight well, for he would be overweighted
              and overbalanced by his head. He might very likely be in the foremost place in a herd,
              for, when a herd is moved the hinds and young male deer always move in front, and the
              big stags bring up the rear; but he could never bully anything bigger than a four year
              old. . . . It may be questioned if Shakespeare was correct in using the word
              &lsquo;rascal&rsquo; only in this restricted sense; and if the term be
              extended to its legitimate limits, so as to cover all young male deer, then
              Shakespeare's similes are false; for a young stag (as the sportsmen of the day well
              knew) can and will run better than any other and can fight savagely enough if he
              husbands some strength for the bay; which, however, as a rule he does not. [It is to
              be feared that Fortescue has taken the words of Touchstone too literally as an
              indication of Shakespeare's knowledge of venery. The context, of which this line is
              but a small part, shows that there is here intended but another allusion to a jest
              which was never stale to Shakespeare and his fellows, unsavory as it may be to us.
              &lsquo;Rascal,&rsquo; as Touchstone uses it here, is simply following out the
              idea expressed in &lsquo;poor men&rsquo; in contrast to the
              &lsquo;noblest.&rsquo; That is, Both noble and poor are alike subject to the

              anything is to be gotten.&rsquo; &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>:
              &lsquo;Worst in blood&rsquo; may be the true reading. In <hi rend="italic">1

              >Malone</hi>: The phrase &lsquo;in blood&rsquo; was a phrase of the forest.
              Our author seldom was careful that his comparisons should answer on both sides. He
              seems to mean here &lsquo;thou worthless scoundrel, though like a deer not in
              blood, thou art in the worst condition for running of all the herd of plebeians,
              takest the lead in this tumult, in order to obtain some private advantage to
              yourself.&rsquo; What advantage the foremost of a herd of deer could obtain is not
              easy to point out, nor did Shakespeare, I believe, consider. Perhaps, indeed, he only
              uses &lsquo;rascal&rsquo; in its ordinary sense. So afterwards,
              &lsquo;From rascals worse than they,&rsquo; [I, vi, 56]. Dr Johnson's
              interpretation appears to me inadmissible; as the term, though it is applicable both
              in its original and metaphorical sense to a man, cannot, I think, be applied to a dog;
              nor have I found any instance of the term &lsquo;in blood&rsquo; being applied
              to the canine species. [Malone refers to a note of his on &lsquo;The deer was, as
              you know, sanguis, in blood,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Love's Labour's Lost,</hi>
              IV, ii, 3, but as he there merely discusses a question as to a textual change in
              regard to the word &lsquo;sanguis,&rsquo; his remarks are of no assistance in
              the present passage. As to Malone's remark that &lsquo;in blood&rsquo; is a
              &lsquo;phrase of the forest&rsquo; I can but say that so it may be, but a
              careful search of the Duke of York's volume, <hi rend="italic">The Master of Game,
                circa</hi> 1400; of Turberville's <hi rend="italic">Noble Arte of Venerie,</hi>
              1576, and of N. Coxe's <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's Recreation,</hi> 1674, has not
              yielded any example of such a phrase either in the lists of terms used in the chase or
              in the various descriptions of the Hart, the Buck, the Roebuck, or the Deer; with
              these writers the usual term applied to a Hart in his prime condition is either
              &lsquo;pride&rsquo; or &lsquo;prime of grease.&rsquo; The <hi
                rend="italic">N. E. D.,</hi> s. v. Blood, under the caption <hi rend="italic"
                >Hunting phrase,</hi> quotes the passages from <hi rend="italic">1 Henry VI.</hi>
              and <hi rend="italic">Love's Labour's Lost,</hi> given above, and but one other as
              follows: &lsquo;When hounds are out of blood, there is a kind of evil genius
              attending all that they do, while a pack of fox hounds well in blood, like troops
              flushed with conquest, are not easily withstood.&rsquo;&mdash;P. Beckford
              (1781), <hi rend="italic">Hunting,</hi> p. 308. It would, I think, be unfair to Malone
              to say that he did not know of this when he remarked that he had not &lsquo;found
              any instance of the term applied to the canine species&rsquo;; all that he means
              apparently is that in writings contemporary with Shakespeare the phrase, as far as he
              knows, does not appear; the comparatively modern date of the quotation from Beckford
              seems to justify such a conclusion. I speak with great diffidence, but possibly the
              phrase &lsquo;in blood&rsquo; thus applied to a deer in its prime is original
              with Shakespeare since no other writer has used it in exactly this
                sense.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's Sh.</hi>): Malone says, &lsquo;What
              advantage the foremost of a herd of deer could obtain is not easy to point
              out.&rsquo; But the latter part of l. 169 really applies to the Citizen: <hi
                rend="italic">he</hi>&mdash;&lsquo;to win some
              advantage&rsquo;&mdash;thrusts himself into the first place, though no more
              worthy of it than a &lsquo;rascal&rsquo; stag which somehow gets into the
              place of honour at the head of the herd and ought therefore to be fittest to hunt.

              reason of that too is assigned) will be very hard to conceive. Peace, he says, made

              for those are what make a people proud; but then those are what they like but too

              being contrary to what the text says, we may be assured it is corrupt, and that
              Shakespeare wrote: &lsquo;That <hi rend="italic">likes not</hi> peace, nor

              should have passed it over as one that required no manner of explanation.
              &lsquo;That like nor peace nor war&rsquo; means, that are not contented with
              either peace or war; the one affrighted them, and they therefore disliked it; the
              other made them proud, and pride is the parent of discontent. I don't understand the
              force of Warburton's amendment, as I think the case is pretty much the same, whether
              we say &lsquo;that they like not peace&rsquo; or &lsquo;that peace does
              not please them.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Heath</hi> (409): The
              excessive affectation of subtilty misled Mr Warburton into this violent construction
              [&lsquo;that likes not,&rsquo; etc.]. The common reading to a common
              understanding is plain enough and would meet with no difficulty. The meaning is:
              Neither peace nor war can satisfy you, or content you. In war you are always afraid of
              the consequences; and in peace your pride won't let you be quiet, or think any
              treatment of you, however kind and favourable, equal to your deservings. But Mr
              Warburton by a long train of profound reasonings, hath discovered that the mob must
              necessarily love peace because it brings with it an increase of wealth and power,
              whereas the very contrary of this was the constant experience of the Roman republic.
              In peace the Plebeians were always most oppressed because the Patricians had then most
              need of their assistance; whereas in time of war they were obliged to pay court to
              them for their own preservation. [It is, I think, quite beside the point here to enter
              into any discussion as to the relative value of the statements of either Warburton or
              Heath regarding the attitude of the Plebeians to the states of war and peace in the
              days of the Roman republic. Coriolanus says they are satisfied with neither state.
              That is all there is to it; we must, moreover, bear in mind that this is the petulant
              retort of a very testy and irritable man to a set of persons whom he despises. The

              reference to the famous frost of 1607-8. It must be allowed that this is a somewhat
              out-of-the-way image. Coals on ice are not usually a common spectacle; but it would
              seem they were so in the winter of 1607-8, and at that time the image would be by no
              means farfetched or unfamiliar; it would, in fact, be obviously suggested. Of course
              one would lay no great stress on it if there was nothing else to connect the play with
              that time; but there being other things that so connect it, the allusion may perhaps
              be taken as confirmatory. &lsquo;Above Westminster,&rsquo; writes Chamberlain
              to Carleton, January 8, 1607-8, &lsquo;the Thames is quite frozen over, and the
              Archbishop came from Lambeth on Twelfth Day over the ice to Court. Many fantastical
              experiments are daily put in practice, as certain youths burnt a gallon of wine upon
              the ice, and made all the passengers partakers.&rsquo; An account of this frost,
              written during its prevalence, is given in a tract called &lsquo;The Great Frost:

              almost as bombastic as anything to be found in Shakespeare's dramatic predecessors.
              C&aelig;sar's bearing in the interview with the conspirators, when they beg the
              repeal of Cimber's banishment, is not less lo&longs;ty than Tamburlaine's
              inflation, though more calm and dignified&mdash;&lsquo;Know C&aelig;sar
              doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied.&rsquo; And the speech
              beginning &lsquo;I could be well moved, if I were as you,&rsquo; may not be an
              offence against the modesty of nature, but, taken by itself, is an offence against the
              modesty of art. The boasts and brags of Coriolanus out-Herod the Herod of the
              Mysteries. For example [the present lines here quoted], and: <hi rend="bq">
                &lsquo;Let me twine<lb rend="RIGHT"/> Mine arms about that body, where

            </p>
            <p>[This last is, however, in the speech of Aufidius to Coriolanus.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] It is a noticeable circumstance that these inflated
              speeches&mdash;as well as one or two in <hi rend="italic">Ant. &amp;
              Cleo.</hi>&mdash;are put in the mouths of Roman heroes. I am not quite sure that
              this is not one explanation and justification of them: they may have been
              Shakespeare's ideal of what appertained to the Roman character. But apart from their
              being true to the Roman manner, they may be justified also on the principle of
              variety. It must have been a relief to Shakespeare's mind, ever hungry for fresh types
              of character, to expatiate in the well-marked high astounding ideal; and it is equally
              a relief to the student or spectator who may have followed his career and dwelt with
              appeciative insight on his varied representation of humanity. This is the broadest
              justification: if we consider more curiously, other justifications make themselves
              palpable. The inflation of Coriolanus and C&aelig;sar is not like Tamburlaine's,
              presented to us as a thing unquestioned and admired by those around them, as being,
              for aught said upon the stage to the contrary, the becoming language of heroic
              manhood. The violent language of Coriolanus is deprecated by his friends and raises a
              furious antagonism in his enemies. Side by side with C&aelig;sar's high conception
              of himself we have the humorous expression of his greatness by blunt Casca and the
              sneering of cynical Cassius. In the case of C&aelig;sar, too, there is a profound
              contrast between his lofty declaration of immovable constancy and the immediate
              dethronement of the god to lifeless clay. We must not take the rant of
              C&aelig;sar, Coriolanus, or Antony by itself simply as rant, and wish with Ben

              pelting with direct hard words those standing before him, are Shakespeare's freely
              dramatic creations. Yet he has infused the spirit of Martius's advice to the Senate
              about the people into this mould of his own. According to Plutarch, in the first
              disturbance, Martius held that &ldquo;leuity . . . was a beginning of
              disobedience&rdquo; that would &ldquo;bring all to confusion&rdquo;; also,
              in the second, that the people did not equal the nobles &ldquo;in true nobility
              and valiantness.&rdquo; When Plutarch's words directly fit his situation, the Poet
              finds them good enough to borrow with adaptations; when he needs something more direct
              and biting, as here, he himself fashions it, but not without foundation.&rsquo;

              Coriolanus, to which our attention is to be directed in this act, comes into play. At
              the first whisper of danger he becomes the champion of Rome. His high-bred courtesy

              glory than for the triumph of a common cause, as is shown by his declaration about the
              Volscian general, Tullus Aufidius. . . . This is to treat war merely as a gigantic
              duel between rival champions, and to ignore those patriotic aspects of it which alone
              give it moral justification. It is the same exaggerated passion for solely personal
              distinction that makes Coriolanus reject all material rewards for his services. He
              feels that the glory of achievements such as his is tarnished by the acceptance of
              spoils, however splendid, and similarly he refuses to listen to any laudation of his

              a veritable heroic nature for his adversary. Yet another virtue should be visible in

              interpretation of l. 273, and add: &lsquo;It appears to us that in this speech
              Titus Lartius addresses the words &ldquo;Lead you on&rdquo; to the Senators;
              then bids Cominius follow them; adding &ldquo;we&rdquo; (Coriolanus and
              himself) &ldquo;must follow you&rdquo;; concluding with, for you are right
              worthy of that precedence which your appointment as commander-general gives
              you.&rsquo;&mdash;In disagreement with Theobald's change of
              &lsquo;Martius,&rsquo; l. 274, to <hi rend="italic">Lartius</hi> the Cowden
              Clarkes thus continue: &lsquo;We think this is Cominius's sentence of courtesy to
              Coriolanus (intended probably to be accompanied by an inclination of the head), in
              passing to go before him, according to the appointed &ldquo;priority.&rdquo;
              It, as it were, acknowledges the speaker's sense of Coriolanus's right of precedence,
              even while he takes it himself in deference to the Senate's
                decree.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ulrici</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Zus&auml;tze und Berichtigungen,</hi> p. 175): Several English editors take
              this, that Lartius commands Cominius to precede and Coriolanus to follow. The whole
              passage first gains sense and meaning when the honour of precedence is granted to
              Coriolanus. Titus Lartius stands on an equal footing with Cominius. Only with such an
              interpretation is there significance if Cominius, to express his complete agreement,
              turns to Coriolanus with the words, &lsquo;Noble Martius&rsquo;; and
              Theobald's emendation &lsquo;Lartius&rsquo; becomes unnecessary.&mdash;<hi

              to be a reply to the Senator, who has just spoken. [The remainder of Rolfe's note is

              the modern method of dramatic construction&mdash;the method, that is, of making
              the curtain fall at the climax of the scene&mdash;this scene would close, I should
              think, at the exit of Coriolanus. Shakespeare, however, allows characters to remain
              behind, as the Tribunes remain here, and wind up the scene with further comments or
              some <hi rend="italic">slight extension</hi> of the action. Thus in <hi rend="italic"
                >Richard II,</hi> I, iii, when the stirring scene at the lists at Coventry has
              culminated in the King's passing sentence on the rivals and then sweeping from the
              field with all his train, Gaunt and Bolingbroke stay behind for an interview which a
              modern playwright would throw into a scene. Cf. again <hi rend="italic">Mid. N.
              Dream,</hi> I, i, 127, where strictly it is an artificial device to let Hermia and
              Lysander remain behind together, while her father, Egeus, who is angry with Lysander
              for stealing her affections, leaves the stage with all the others. Another
              illustration is the conversation between Goneril and Regan at the end of the first
              scene in <hi rend="italic">Lear.</hi> In such continuations of the scene there is some
              risk of an anti-climax. I think that this peculiar feature of the structure of
              Shakespeare's plays is attributable to the scenic poverty of the Elizabethan stage, on
              which Shakespeare himself dwells </p>
            <p>so strongly in the first and fourth Prologues of <hi rend="italic">Henry V.</hi> In
              the Elizabethan theatre there was no curtain to fall, and practically no scenery to
              mark a change of scene. Hence the tendency was to extend a scene instead of starting a
              fresh one in a fresh locality, as if the playwright thought that certain of his <hi

              contemptuous tone of the foregoing doubtless caused&mdash;as the writer
              intended&mdash; both consternation and pain, coming as it did from one who but a

              the deep obligation he was under for the various notes and emendations which Warburton
              had contributed for Theobald's own edition. Warburton made no mention of the fact that
              Hanmer, his preceding editor, prints this line as an imprecation with an exclamation
              point instead of the Folio's comma after &lsquo;him&rsquo;; and Hanmer does
              not refer to Warburton as the source of this pointing. Hanmer should, therefore, I
              think, be given credit for this reading in spite of Warburton's

              in the line after this he should have put as a gloss; for <hi rend="italic">of being
                so valiant</hi> is, indeed, the sense which the Poet intended in &lsquo;to be so

              &lsquo;his pride is such as not to deserve the accompanying of so much

              live no longer. Those editors who take &lsquo;devour&rsquo; as the indicative

                >ad</hi>&rsquo; with the gerund, denoted a purpose. Thus &lsquo;<hi

                >to</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">toward</hi>) loving&rsquo; (ad amandum).
              Gradually, as <hi rend="italic">to</hi> superseded the proper infinitival inflection,
                <hi rend="italic">to</hi> was used in other and more indefinite senses,
              &lsquo;for,&rsquo; &lsquo;about,&rsquo; &lsquo;in,&rsquo;
              &lsquo;as regards,&rsquo; and, in a word, for any form of the gerund as well
              as for the infinitive. [Among other examples of the infinitive thus indefinitely used
              Abbott quotes and paraphrases l. 289: &lsquo;Too proud to be (of being) so

              had already quoted in support of this; and Hudson concludes his note with Malone's
              interpretation of the latter part of the sentence. In his ed. ii. Hudson, influenced,
              as ever, by Dyce, makes a complete recantation, and without reference to his former
              opinion says: &lsquo;The first part of this speech is imprecative: &ldquo;May

              &lsquo;eaten up by pride&rsquo; are idioms still in use. We think, therefore,
              that the idea of &lsquo;pride in his own valour, strengthened by the occasion for
              its display afforded by these wars, devours him entirely&rsquo; is presented by

              that such an interpretation of l. 288 is based upon a modern text and not upon the
              Folio reading may seem somewhat singular. In fairness to Leo it may, however, be
              stated that such an omission is, I think, an example of an avowed purpose in his
              Edition of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi> In his <hi rend="italic">Preface,</hi>
              p. vi, where, among other features which should constitute an <hi rend="italic"
              >ideal</hi> edition of Shakespeare, he says: &lsquo;Every passage that has
              succeeded in establishing its title to respect, either by the agreement of the old
              editions or of later emendators, should be adopted in the text, without the slightest
              mention of all arguments for and against, which hitherto have been bandied about
              respecting it. The mention of them is not of the least advantage to the public, and
              does not at all advance the purification of the text. There are emendations which have
              stood the ordeal of time, and the errors they are intended to remove, the errors of
              copyists, printers, and early editors, errors which the rust of centuries has
              consecrated in the eyes of fanatics, might at length be consigned to a lasting
                repose.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;Rev. <hi

              Coriolanus; how proud he was; how he had scorned and taunted them when they were
              appointed tribunes; they aggravate his offence by the remark, while perhaps they
              comfort themselves by the reflection, that even the gods themselves&mdash;those
              most high sacrosanct irresponsible arbiters &mdash;even the moon, the very ideal

                >Falcon Ed.,</hi> some five years later, he accepts the Folio reading, placing an
              exclamation point after &lsquo;grown,&rsquo; but this is doubtless a misprint.
              In the latter edition Beeching, in reference to l. 288, says: &lsquo;Is this a
              statement or an imprecation? The Folio has a comma; reading which the sense will be,
              &ldquo;These warlike times spoil him by making him proud; the pride of valour
              devours him.&rdquo; Cf. <hi rend="italic">Tro. &amp; Cress.,</hi> II, iii,
              164, &ldquo;He that's proud eats up himself.&rdquo; This sense seems to suit
              best with the speech of Sicinius which follows. If it be construed as an imprecation,
                <hi rend="italic">the present wars</hi> will mean &ldquo;the war now set on

              doubtful; the latter, though capable of explanation, is unbearably
                harsh.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Page</hi> [follows Hanmer's reading,
              but adds:] The Folio reading may be right, in the sense of &lsquo;His military

              &lsquo;&ldquo;devour him&rdquo; is rather an optative than an indicative.
              Brutus goes on, &ldquo;Such valour, coupled with such pride, is

              Perring's interpretation of the Folio reading, says in conclusion, &lsquo;But the
              allusion to <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> wars (&ldquo;the present
              wars&rdquo;) surely does not suit a <hi rend="italic">general</hi> description of
              Coriolanus's character. One would have expected &ldquo;War&rdquo; personified,
              with some epithet descriptive of its general attributes, or &ldquo;the
              wars&rdquo; (without &ldquo;present&rdquo;).&rsquo;&mdash;<hi

            <p>Mr Craig evidently intended to retain this, practically the Folio punctuation, [<hi
                rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> a semicolon instead of a comma], though he had not set
              down his reasons. The sentence stretches with difficulty to a meaning which is perhaps
              expressed as well as anywhere else by Perring [see <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>]. . . .
              The objection to the interpretation that the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> wars would
              not be given as the cause of a permanent characteristic of Coriolanus does not seem
              altogether valid if we consider that it is not the <hi rend="italic">existence</hi> of
              the quality of pride in him, but its excessive manifestation <hi rend="italic">at the
                time</hi> that has given rise to the dialogue. After all, most readers will prefer
              the usual punctuation (Hanmer's) and sense: May he fall in these wars!&mdash;[In
              all cases where the Folio text or punctuation yields an intelligible meaning it
              should, I think, be retained; that it does so in the present instance is manifest by
              the several paraphrases given in the foregoing notes. On the other hand, while
              Hanmer's and Warburton's change is more forcible than the original, it is actually a

              us with a strange kind of mock-reasoning. Brutus and Sicinius are reasoning together
              about Martius's contenting himself with the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> place in the
              army, leaving the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to Cominius. &lsquo;Herein (says
              Brutus) he acts prudently; for, Fame being his motive, and he having already an
              established character, he by this means less risks the losing of it. For, in case of
              any miscarriage, the fault will be thrown on Cominius, the General; and giddy
              censurers will be apt enough to cry: It would have been otherwise if Martius had had
              the management!&rsquo; To this observation Sicinius might very pertinently add the
              following: &lsquo;That, moreover, if things should go well the opinion of the
              people was so firmly to Martius that he would certainly carry off some part of the
              praise due to Cominius.&rsquo; And this sense will be obtained: <hi rend="bq">
                &lsquo;Opinion, that so sticks on Martius,<lb/> Shall of his merits rob

            </p>
            <p>Thus the passage goes on very sensibly. Brutus remarks, &lsquo;That by his <hi

                rend="italic">disgrace</hi> of any <hi rend="italic">miscarriage,</hi>&rsquo;
              and Sicinius </p>
            <p>adds, &lsquo;That by his <hi rend="italic">superiority in character</hi> he would

              spared himself this rather verbose paraphrase, with its needless alteration of text

              <hi rend="smallcap">Prolss</hi> (p. 94): After we have thus been made acquainted with
              one despised opponent, at whom Marcius has railed, the Roman people and its Tribunes,
              Shakespeare, in this second scene of the drama, presents to us </p>
            <p>in person another opponent, one both sought for and highly regarded by Marcius,
              Tullus Aufidius. He is perhaps quite as blood-thirsty and brave as Marcius; in any
              case he possesses quite as strong a feeling of self-confidence, which draws him
              towards Marcius in no less degree than that which attracts the latter. Yet he has no
              word of praise for Marcius, but rather he cherishes the wish to conquer him either now
              or later, in honourable battle, because the fame of Marcius allows him no rest. This
              scene as well as the following is designed to foreshadow and prepare for the battle
              scenes. The sudden uprising of the Romans has completely thwarted the designs of the
              Volscians to fall upon them unprepared. They are themselves on the point of attack.
              Corioli, which must bear the first brunt, must protect itself, and, while Aufidius
              with the army awaits the enemy in the field, must, if needful, bring reinforcements. </p>

              the standing form of the name of the Volscian town not only in Shakespeare but also in
              North's translation.&rsquo; Schmidt has evidently overlooked the present line, and
              likewise two other passages, I, iv, 3 (stagedirection) and I, iv, 23, where there is
              still another variation in the spelling, viz.: &lsquo;Corialus&rsquo;; in the
              six other passages wherein the name occurs it is spelt &lsquo;Corioles&rsquo;
              as Schmidt gives it; this last, as he says, is the only form in which the name appears
              in North's translation.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">S. Lee</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Caxton Sh., Introd.,</hi> p.
              xxxiii.): The character of Aufidius is developed by Shakespeare on lines which
              Plutarch suggested, and the mingling in him of meanness and liberality lacks
              completeness in either author. At the opening of the play he figures as a brave
              soldier, &lsquo;a lion&rsquo; whom Coriolanus is &lsquo;proud to
              hunt,&rsquo; but the rivalry between the two warriors has generated a personal
              hatred which evokes a characteristic divergence of expression. It is Coriolanus's
              highest ambition to meet and kill his hated adversary in a fair personal encounter.
              Aufidius confesses that he cares not by what device he overcome his enemy, provided
              only he get the better of him. &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Bradley</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> p. 16): The drawing of the character of Aufidius
              seems to me by far the weakest spot in the drama. At one place, where he moralizes on
              the banishment of the hero, Shakespeare, it appears to some critics, is himself
              delivering a speech which tells the audience nothing essential and ends in desperate
              obscurity, [IV, vii, 30-59]. Two other speeches have been criticized. In the first,
              Aufidius, after his defeat in the field, declares that, since he cannot overcome his
              rival in fair fight, he will do it in any way open to him, however dishonourable. The
              other is his lyrical cry of rapture when Coriolanus discloses himself in the house at
              Antium. The intention in both cases is clear. Aufidius is contrasted with the hero as
              a man of much slighter and less noble nature, whose lively impulses, good and bad,
              quickly give way before a new influence, and whose action is in the end determined by
              the permanent pressure of ambition and rivalry. But he is a man of straw. He was
              wanted merely for the plot, and in reading some passages in his talk we seem to see
              Shakespeare yawning as he wrote. </p>

              <hi rend="smallcap">Warburton</hi>: The first part of this sentence is without

                <hi rend="italic">prest a power,</hi> which was on foot. To which the words in
              question are the answer of a Senator. And to make them pertinent we should read them
              thus: &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">fore they</hi> remove Bring up your
              army,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> Before that power, already on foot, be
              in motion, bring up your army; then he corrects himself and says, but I believe you

              army <hi rend="italic">to remove them.</hi> If any change should be made, I would

              pleasant blunder, which the vulgar would be apt to call a bull. [Heath here gives
              Warburton's interpretation.] It will perhaps puzzle Mr Warburton's philosophy to
              explain, how the Roman power could set down, and lay siege to Corioli, before they
              were in motion. But the common reading, &lsquo;for the remove&rsquo; was
              perfectly right, if he had but endeavored to understand it. The sense is, In order to
              oblige them to raise the siege, bring up your army; in the mean time we are fully
              sufficient to guard the city.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>:
              &lsquo;The remove&rsquo; and &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">their</hi>
              remove&rsquo; are so near in sound that the transcriber's ear might easily have

              In this passage the antithesis of the sentence absolutely requires us to read

              scene was set in the rearstage, whose compartment-like semi-separation from the
              fore-stage could simulate, without interruption for stage-setting, an interior
              somewhat removed from the outdoor turmoil of the preceding part of the action. There
              could conveniently be placed the two <hi rend="italic">lowe stooles</hi> where
              Volumnia and Virgilia <hi rend="italic">set them downe</hi> and sewed. Possibly when
              Volumnia and Valeria made their exeunt &lsquo;over the threshold,&rsquo; which
              Virgilia declared she would not pass, nor turn her <hi rend="italic">solemnesse out a
                doore</hi> as Valeria begged her to do, the effect for the audience was that she was
              still at home in Rome, as the curtains, with which the rear-stage seems to have been
              furnished in Shakespeare's plays, closed her from view, after the other ladies were
              seen to pass through the central door in the rear-stage into the
              &lsquo;tyring-room.&rsquo;&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Rhodes</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">The Stagery of Sh.,</hi> p. 40): The setting of properties upon the
              after-stage in no way precluded, but usually demanded the action&mdash;at least in
              part&mdash;taking place upon the fore-stage. Indeed, in very few scenes was the
              action confined to the after-stage. . . . Again, because
              &lsquo;moveables&rsquo; were used in a scene, it does not always follow that
              they were discovered on the after-stage. (<hi rend="italic">Note,</hi> p. 98: In <hi
                rend="italic">The Taming of the Shrew,</hi> as revived for continuous performance in
              full text by Sir John Martin Harvey, in 1913, the stage properties, such as chairs,
              tables, and so on, were placed in position, in full view of the audience, by the
              servants dressed &lsquo;in the period.&rsquo; This method was perhaps due to
              his adviser, Mr William Poel, who has always been enamoured with it; but there is no
              reason to suppose that on the stage of Shakespeare it was the general practice or
              anything but an expediency. Moreover, where the men appeared, to move properties, it
              is usually clear that they appeared in the dramatic character of household servants.
              Sometimes, however, it was otherwise. As Mr Puff said to the scenemen in <hi
                rend="italic">The Critic</hi> (1779): &lsquo;It is always awkward, in a tragedy,
              to have you fellows coming on in your playhouse liveries to remove things. I wish it
              could be managed better.&rsquo;) In <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> Act I, sc.
              iii, whose initial direction is: &lsquo;They set them downe on two lowe stooles
              and sowe,&rsquo; was played on the fore-stage, since the after-stage could not be
              used &lsquo;with set movables&rsquo; in two successive scenes, and it was
              needed for the next scene, which is before the Gates of Corioli. This is the only
              direction in Shakespeare which points to the early origin of &lsquo;Two chairs to
              the front. It's a custom in our profession,&rsquo; as it is styled in Robertson's
                <hi rend="italic">David Garrick</hi> (1864). [Who shall decide when two such critics
              disagree? Miss Porter's descriptive arrangement&mdash;be it said nowise in
              disparagement&mdash;is evidently based on a theoretic knowledge of the Elizabethan
              stage, while that of Rhodes is, just as evidently, based on the pragmatic. His
              illustrations of the actual working out of other scenes inclines me to favour his view
              of the present case.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              <hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's Sh.</hi>): The main
              purpose of this scene is to show up the character of Volumnia, the typical Roman
              matron, to whom Virgilia is obviously meant as a foil. Volumnia is important not only
                <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> in that she has so much to do with the actual working
              of the plot but also in relation to Coriolanus, who is what he is largely through her
              and her training. As a scene of domestic interest set in a framework of natural stress
              this scene may be compared with the scene between Lady Macduff and Ross in <hi
                rend="italic">Macbeth,</hi> IV, ii. The resemblance is heightened by the
              introduction of the little boy. There are not very many portraits of children in
              Shakespeare's plays, and (as has been well said) about almost all of them clings a
              certain pathos. Witness, above all, Prince Arthur in <hi rend="italic">King John.</hi>
              Perhaps, indeed, this lies not in the presentment of the individual child, but in the
              ever-felt contrast between simple childhood and great surroundings. </p>

              prose. Only as Volumnia, in the ecstasy of her maternal pride, describes her son in
              the middle of the turmoil of battle, does she rise to expressing herself in blank
              verse. [In this long article Delius attempts to show by examples the various reasons

              published in 1805, have long since been banished from the pages of this edition, it is
              but fair to say that this reading (&lsquo;At Grecian swords,
              contemning&rsquo;) was first proposed by him, thus anticipating Collier's

              substantively yields &lsquo;a very harsh and obscure sense&rsquo; and loses
              &lsquo;the bold figure of the warrior's forehead thus bleeding as in contempt of

              written by Shakespeare,&rsquo; and yet contented himself with the very inferior

              &lsquo;Tu quoque&rsquo;&mdash;as Singer in his first ed., 1826, had also
              contented himself with the very inferior reading; in his second ed., 1856, three years

              &lsquo;contemning,&rsquo; without any mention either of Collier's conjecture

              required, as <hi rend="italic">e. g.,</hi> &lsquo;at the stroke of Grecian
              swords.&rsquo; My suggestion, in accordance with this view, is the alteration of

              >contunding,</hi>&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> the forehead spits forth
              blood at the bruising inflicted by Grecian swords. The objection against this, that
                <hi rend="italic">contund</hi> is a verb not employed by our author, although he has
                <hi rend="italic">contusion,</hi> and rarely by anybody else, is certainly
              formidable, and I can set against it only the pleas that the emendation requires the
              smallest of changes in the text, that it yields the exact sense wanted, and that
              Shakespeare was in the constant habit of using what we should now consider uncouth and
              pedantic terms derived from the Latin, yet seldom without a precise and even forcible
              meaning. The last clause of this remark is, in fact, exemplified by the proposed
              emendation. The Latin <hi rend="italic">contundo</hi> signifies to batter, bang,
              bruise; and since the old Grecian warriors wore helmets that completely hid the
              forehead, the only way of drawing blood from that part with the sword was by <hi
                rend="italic">contunding</hi> the casque. Had our author written <hi rend="italic"
                >piercing</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pricking,</hi> the language would have been less
              appropriate.&mdash;[On philological grounds alone Bailey's extravagant proposal is
              quite inadmissible. The earliest example of the verb <hi rend="italic">contund,</hi>
              in the sense <hi rend="italic">to bruise</hi> or hurt the human body, is given in the
                <hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi> as 1654. Prior to that date the verb is used only in
              its technical sense to break or macerate in pieces for medicinal

              There is but one subordinate character among the females in this play, and that is
              Valeria, the friend of Volumnia and Virgilia. The part is necessarily a very slight
              one; yet, being a patrician lady, and an intimate of the principals, the poet takes
              occasion to exalt her qualities with the reader through a third party. Coriolanus
              describes her as <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;The noble sister of Publicola,<lb
                  rend="RIGHT"/> The moon of Rome; chaste as the icicle<lb/> That's curded by the

            <p>A passage which, for the beauty of the poetry, and as a lustrous image of woman's
              perfection, I should suppose has never been surpassed. In Act I, sc. iii, where
              Valeria comes to pay a morning visit to the two ladies, we again have an
              example&mdash;even upon so minim an occasion&mdash;of Shakespeare's perception
              of all the characteristic points to be produced, and with advantage. One would
              suppose, from this effective little scene, that he had put himself upon &lsquo;a
              course&rsquo; of etiquette, and had taken honours and degrees in the science of
              making &lsquo;morning calls.&rsquo; . . . After reading this very unimportant
              part of Valeria, and which consists of but a half-dozen short sentences, no one, I
              should think, would be so hardy as to maintain (which nevertheless has been asserted
              in the fantastical spirit of criticism) that Shakespeare slovened his insignificant
              characters in order to throw his principals into high relief. </p>

              spun, which each night she ravelled out, is one of Shakespeare's deftest light
              touches. By this scene and the praise Coriolanus later gives her (V, iii, 71-74) the

              from which the audience are to be quick to assume they have just dismounted as from a
              journey. The scene then is no longer to be imagined as Rome. And their talk is long
              enough to permit that arrangement of the rear-stage which all the siege-scenes in the
              plays indicate, namely, bare walls, denuded of curtains, presenting the appearance of
              gates on a level with the audience and high city walls. On the top of these, that is,
              on the upper-stage, <hi rend="italic">the two Senators</hi> of the besieged city <hi

              plays depicting a siege scaling ladders to set against the walls and climb upon added
              to the effectiveness of the stage action. In this case much play with these ladders
              was not indulged in, for, as Martius rejoins, the Volscians did not
              &lsquo;feare&rsquo; them. They issued forth through the gates, which, as the
              Senator promised, opened &lsquo;of themselves,&rsquo; beating the Romans
              forward on to the forestage, until Marcius alone, not having been beaten forward with
              the rest, enters as from these gates, charging his men to come on, and then, following

              however, with the Folio's second scene, between Aufidius and his lieutenant; for this
              he advises a very deep stage and gives the following description of the scenic
              arrangement: &lsquo;In the background the walls and fortifications of Corioli;
              diagonally left, the gate of the stronghold. The border-space remains quite open for
              the entrance of troops and the conference of the commanders. The middle-stage rises
              gradually towards Corioli; from the level of the border-space the road winds up to the
              gate of Corioli. This middle space is cut off by set pieces (Rocks, mounds, etc.),
              back of which the actions, skirmishes, and fights take place, partly concealed to the
              audience. Corioli is raised to such a height that the figures of Coriolanus and the
              soldiers may be easily seen as they struggle before the gates.&rsquo; </p>

              &lsquo;less&rsquo; in that preceding was the author's word, and it is

                rend="italic">more</hi> is the word requir'd by the sense and which the poet
              intended, but was betray'd into a use of the other for the sake of contrasting it with
              &lsquo;lesser,&rsquo; which occurs in the next sentence. &mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Douce</hi> (ap. <hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>, 1793): Dr
              Johnson's note appears to me unnecessary, nor do I think with Mr Malone that
              Shakespeare has here <hi rend="italic">entangled</hi> himself, but, on the contrary,
              that he could not have expressed himself better. The sense is: &lsquo;however
              little Tullus Aufidius fears, there is not a man within the walls that fears you <hi

            <p>you least.&rsquo; [Dr Johnson's alteration] is better sense, and perhaps
              &lsquo;less&rsquo; is due to a confusion not unlike that in <hi rend="italic"
                >Lear,</hi> II, iv, 142: &lsquo;You less know how to value her desert Than she

                Clarke</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi>): The sentence, we think, means:
              &lsquo;No, he is not within the walls, nor is there there a man that fears you
              less than he, who fears you less than next to nothing.&rsquo; No man can fear less
              than one who fears less than a little; and this is one of those simple verities which
              Shakespeare often gives under the form of an apparent antithesis.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">T. Page</hi>: We are inclined to accept Clarke's interpretation
              here. Probably, however, &lsquo;That's lesser than a little&rsquo; is
              equivalent to &lsquo;which is indeed <hi rend="italic">nothing at
                all.</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Schmidt</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Coriolanus</hi>) objects to Whitelaw's interpretation on the ground that even were
              it grammatically possible it would furnish not a commendation of the absent Aufidius,
              but an arrogant boast on the part of his advocate. &lsquo;It is much
              better,&rsquo; Schmidt adds, &lsquo;to consider this one of those instances,
              quite frequent in Shakespeare, where by the use of negatives the negation is doubled,
              apparently illogically, but not contrary to the character of vivid speech. Thus in <hi
                rend="italic">Richard III,</hi> &lsquo;You may deny that you were not the
              cause.&rsquo; In <hi rend="italic">Winter's Tale,</hi> &lsquo;wanted less
              impudence&rsquo; = had less impudence. If any alteration is permissible we might
              write, &lsquo;nor a man that fears you&mdash;less than he,&rsquo; etc.,
              and thus interpret: &lsquo;Nor a man that fears you&mdash;even less than he
              (are we frightened); with a natural ellipse for which parallels may easily be
                found.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi>: &lsquo;That
              fears you less than he&rsquo; is probably what Shakespeare wrote, though, as
              Johnson pointed out, he ought to have said &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">more</hi> than
              he.&rsquo; But there is a similar mistake in <hi rend="italic">Tro. &amp;
                Cress.,</hi> I, i, 28: &lsquo;Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be, Doth
              lesser blench at sufferance than I do.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Beeching</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Falcon Sh.</hi>): A confusion of &lsquo;nor a
              man that fears you more than he&rsquo; with &lsquo;and no man fears you less
              than he.&rsquo; Confusion in the use of the comparatives is not uncommon in the
              best writers. See, <hi rend="italic">e. g., Paradise Lost,</hi> i, 257, &lsquo;And
              what I should be, all but less than he&rsquo; (a confusion of <hi rend="italic"
                >less</hi> with <hi rend="italic">all but equal</hi>).&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Chambers</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Warwick Sh.</hi>): Johnson would read
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">more</hi> than he&rsquo;; but it is Aufidius's
              contempt for Coriolanus on which stress is being laid, not that of the other
                Volsces.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's
              Sh.</hi>): Two ideas struggle for expression because the speaker is thinking
              simultaneously but differently of the citizens inside Corioli and of
              Aufidius&mdash;thus: (1) There is no man in the city who fears you more than
              Aufidius does, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> the besieged are not afraid of you at
              all; (2) &lsquo;Aufidius is not here, and (if he were) there is no man who fears
              you <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than he does.&rsquo; Neither <hi rend="italic"
                >less</hi> (the Folio's reading) nor the suggested alteration <hi rend="italic"
              >more</hi> can cover both ideas. &lsquo;Less&rsquo; is undoubtedly right; cf.
                <hi rend="italic">lesser</hi> in the next line. Moreover, &lsquo;less&rsquo;
              agrees with that tendency to intensify a negative idea which we get so often in
              Shakespeare; compare the frequent use of the double negative. The tendency to repeat a
              negative is a general principle of language and may be illustrated not from
              Shakespeare alone. </p>

              shames of Rome; you herds; of boils and plagues,&rsquo; etc., says:
              &lsquo;Here the old copies are defective in the pointing, by which the sense is so
              maim'd that this too must be a passage which either was not revised by Mr Pope, or in
              which he would not indulge his private sense to make it intelligible. Mr Dennis, who
              has alter'd this Play, was obliged, by a different disposition of the Fable, to leave
              out this passage, otherwise, I am persuaded, there would have been no room for my
              making a correction upon it. The meanest judges of English must be aware that no
              member of any sentence can begin with a genitive case, and a preceding nominative be
              wanting to govern that and the verb. Where, therefore, is the nominative to <hi
                rend="italic">of boils and plagues plaster you o'er?</hi> Or what sense or syntax is
              there in the passage as it now stands? Restore it without the least doubt,
              &lsquo;You shames of Rome, you! Herds of boils and plagues,&rsquo; etc. It is
              not infrequent with Shakespeare to redouble his pronouns, as in this place. So,
              &lsquo;I am no baby, I; that with base pray'rs I should repent the evil I have
              done,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Titus And.,</hi> [V, iii, 185]. So, <hi

              passage, like almost every other abrupt sentence in these plays, was rendered
              unintelligible in the old copy by inaccurate punctuation. &lsquo;You herd of <hi
                rend="italic">cowards!</hi>&rsquo; Marcius would say, but his rage prevents him.
              In a former passage he is equally impetuous and abrupt: <hi rend="bq">

            </p>
            <p>Speaking of the people in a subsequent scene he uses the same expression:
              &lsquo;Are these your herd? Must these have voices,&rsquo; &amp;c. Again:
              &lsquo;More of your conversation would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the

              this line: &lsquo;You shames of Rome! you herd of&mdash;Boils and
              plagues,&rsquo; etc., remarking in his note that for this regulation he is
              answerable. Johnson had, however, thus given the line in his text twentyfive years
              before Malone's appeared; an unfortunate betrayal of the fact that Malone had not
              examined the texts of all his predecessors, since he ascribes to them, without

              mere conjecture, but more probably with the aid of some extraneous authority) by the
              MS. Corrector; and when pointed out it must, we apprehend, be admitted without an
              instant's controversy: &lsquo;You shames of Rome! <hi rend="italic">Unheard</hi>
              of boils and plagues Plaster you o'er,&rsquo; &amp;c. The whole difficulty
              seems to have been produced by a strange lapse on the part of the old
              printer.&mdash;[The challenge conveyed in the whole tone of this presentation of
              the emendation by his MS. Corrector is unfortunately characteristic of Collier's Notes
              on these corrections. A challenge which Collier's opponents, Singer and Dyce, accepted
              at once, armed with rancor and bitterness. Singer (<hi rend="italic">Sh.
              Vindicated,</hi> p. 210) thus replies: &lsquo;I do not hesitate to prefer the
              reading universally adopted to the very improbable reading proposed,
              &ldquo;Unheard of boils and plagues&rdquo;; why <hi rend="italic">unheard</hi>
              of? <hi rend="italic">Heard</hi> is the way in which <hi rend="italic">herd</hi> is
              spelt in other places. Marcius is in a vehement passion, and the interruption in his
              invective marks his impatient anger. He thus breaks off from hasty indignation
              elsewhere; and every one must see the superior effect this would have in
              representation to what it is now proposed to substitute. The corrector of my second
              folio has, however, substituted <hi rend="italic">A</hi> for &ldquo;You&rdquo;
              and reads, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">A</hi> herd of byles and plagues,&rdquo;
                etc.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi> hits both Singer and
              Collier. Damning with faint praise the MS. correction with the remark that he does not
              think it &lsquo;very improbable,&rsquo; and turning on Singer with the remark
              that &lsquo;the &ldquo;boils&rdquo; might be termed &ldquo;unheard
              of&rdquo; if those on whom they fell were consequently to &ldquo;be abhorr'd

              it seems to us, are far from improvements. As the text stands Marcius is
              characteristically seized with a transport of passion, and the break in his speech
              finely marks his sudden explosion of rage. [Hudson is here, of course, referring to
              Johnson's regulation of the line. In his ed. ii. he modifies his opinion of Collier's
              MS. Corrector's change, saying that he is &lsquo;by no means sure that it ought
              not to be preferred,&rsquo; though he does not go so far as to adopt it in his

                >Ingleby</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sh. Hermeneutics,</hi> p. 22): From Johnson to
              Collier every editor understands by &lsquo;Heard,&rsquo; armentum, save the
              latter, who reads &lsquo;unheard-of&rsquo;; a conjecture which, like so many
              other candidates for admission into the text, is good </p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">per se</hi> as a probable misprint, but bad in this place as a
              substitute for the suspected words. The reason is this: Passion takes concrete forms
              and avoids generalities. Martius would, in the hands of a master, have been made to
              denounce a specific malady on the Romans rather than have weakened the force of his
              substantives by the prefix &lsquo;unheard-of.&rsquo; But there is yet another
              reason. We cannot part with &lsquo;heard&rsquo; in the sense of <hi
                rend="italic">Armentum.</hi> Twice in this play the people are so designated, and
              once in <hi rend="italic">Jul. C&aelig;s.;</hi> in all with the same contemptuous
              usage as in the passage under consideration. We adduce this passage not because the
              difficulty admits of removal, but because it does not. It is just one of those which
              we must be content to take and leave as we find it. A score of suppositions may be
              made to account for the presence of the preposition &lsquo;of.&rsquo; We might
              treat that preposition as governing &lsquo;boils and plagues,&rsquo; with the
              sense of <hi rend="italic">with;</hi> or as governed by &lsquo;you
              herd,&rsquo; followed by an aposeopesis; or we might treat
              &lsquo;of&rsquo; as an adverb, equivalent to &lsquo;off!&rsquo; and so
              forth; all these expedients being equally unsatisfactory, and there are still other
              possibilities to consider. But in such a case it is not decision that is required, but
              faith. We must stand by the text and wait. The passage resembles one in <hi
                rend="italic">Timon:</hi> &lsquo;Of man and beast the infinite malady Crust you
              quite o'er.&rsquo;&mdash;III, vi, 108.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Schmidt</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>) is unwilling to accept unreservedly
              the regulation of this line as printed by Johnson, since it would be more in character
              for Coriolanus to apply to the retreating soldiers the worst epithet he could utter.
              Schmidt therefore gives the line as in the Folio, placing an exclamation point after
              &lsquo;Plagues&rsquo; and taking the verb &lsquo;plaster&rsquo; as
              reflexive. &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi> in reference to this
              interpretation says: &lsquo;Although Shakespeare's vocabulary of terms of abuse
              was most copious, I do not think he would employ so violent a figure as to designate
              by the names of diseases those who were the subjects of them. It is true that in I, i,
              171 &lsquo;scab&rsquo; is a term of contempt, but this is rather the result of
              disease than the disease itself. And similarly, when Stephano says in <hi
                rend="italic">The Temp.,</hi> V, i, 286, &ldquo;O touch me not; I am not
              Stephano, but a cramp,&rdquo; he uses the word of the contortions and soreness
              which are the result of cramp. Hence I cannot regard &ldquo;boils and
              plagues&rdquo; in the present passage as descriptive of the cowardly soldiers, and
              therefore connected with the preceding &ldquo;herd of,&rdquo; but rather as
              the subject of &ldquo;plaster&rdquo; and the beginning of Coriolanus's curse.
              &ldquo;Byle&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bile&rdquo; is the old spelling of <hi
                rend="italic">boil</hi> in the early copies of Shakespeare as well as in the
              Authorised Version, and represents the pronunciation of the
                word.&rsquo;&mdash;[<hi rend="smallcap">F. A. Leo</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Jahrbuch,</hi> xv, p. 48) in a review of Schmidt's edition objects to the editor's
              elucidation and his regulation of this passage on grounds almost similar to those set
              forth by Wright, but at greater length. It is, I think, sufficient to record this
              without entering more fully into Leo's arguments, which are comments on Schmidt rather
              than on Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

                &amp; Q.,</hi> Dec. 1, 1877, p. 423): I cannot believe that Coriolanus would
              have stopped short at &lsquo;You herd of&mdash;.&rsquo; He would have had
              no difficulty in completing the invective with &lsquo;hinds&rsquo; or some
              such word. Like the grand old lady, his mother, from whom he had inherited at once the
              nobility of his nature and the impetuosity of his temper, he was never at a loss for
              words, and least of all when his passion was roused. I venture to suggest a reading
              which involves the change only of a single letter in the passage as it stands in the
              Folio, where &lsquo;herd&rsquo; is found in its old form
              &lsquo;Heard.&rsquo; &lsquo;You shames of Rome, you! Hoard of boils and
              plagues,&rsquo; etc. The contemptuous repetition of &lsquo;you&rsquo; is
              quite in Shakespeare's manner. The play upon words in </p>
            <p>&lsquo;hoard&rsquo; and &lsquo;abhorred&rsquo; is also quite in his
              manner. And, lastly, we find the word &lsquo;hoard&rsquo; in a similar
              invective in this very play: &lsquo;O ye're well met: the hoarded plague of the
              gods Requite your love!&rsquo;&mdash;IV, ii, 17.&mdash;[As recorded in the

              contempt, as if no word of abuse were sufficient to express his angry scorn. Compare
              his abruptness in I, i, 226; I, vi, 54. That <hi rend="italic">herds</hi> is the word
              Shakespeare wrote may be inferred from III, i, 44; cf. also III, ii, 43.&rsquo;
              [The reading <hi rend="italic">herds</hi> is, however, an emendation by Rowe; and in
              the line III, ii, 43 <hi rend="italic">herd</hi> is Warburton's reading, generally

              his Elizabethan freedom entirely bookish and coherent after the manner of the
              eighteenth century still remains evident in the change of punctuation here. A
              characteristic reflexive use of the verb, as pointed out by Schmidt, is thus effaced.
              The sense is, <hi rend="italic">You heard of Byles and Plagues</hi> (may Byles and
              Plagues) <hi rend="italic">Plaister you o're,</hi> etc. The same economy of diction,
              swiftly re-applying, without repetition, the words just used, as subject, also, for
              what follows, appears later in the same battle-speech (l. 64), which in sense runs
              thus: <hi rend="italic">'Tis for the followers</hi> (of) <hi rend="italic"

              The old stagedirection [ll. 61, 62] probably caused the error. The four words,

              stage-direction [ll. 61, 62] is altered in the modern editions [see <hi rend="italic"
                >Text. Notes,</hi> Malone]. Whether the new direction is better is of no moment; the
              point is that it is different. The real question at issue is whether Shakespeare wrote
              &lsquo;As they us to our trenches followes.&rsquo; The rhythm is appalling in
              itself, and doubly appalling as a desperate appeal in battle. Nor is it improved, save
              in a purely mechanical sense, by reading &lsquo;follow&egrave;d.&rsquo;
              The dramatic force is frittered away by the rhythmical debility. The same incident is
              referred to a little further on by a Messenger (&lsquo;I saw our party to their
              trenches <hi rend="italic">driven</hi>&rsquo;) and by Cominius (&lsquo;Where
              is that slave which told me they had <hi rend="italic">beat</hi> you to your
              trenches?&rsquo;). Nothing so weak as &lsquo;followes&rsquo; there. Is it
              conceivable that the prime actor in the heat of the battle should have used the flabby
              word? At all events, no one will deny that &lsquo;We'll beat them to their wives,
              As they us to our trenches&rsquo; is better poetry, better Shakespeare, and better
              drama. Have we the right to improve the Folio? If we take the Folio stage-direction,
              we find the suspect word in it. If we count spaces as letters the distance from
              &lsquo;As&rsquo; to &lsquo;followes&rsquo; in the text is twenty-seven
              letters; while the distance from &lsquo;Another&rsquo; to
              &lsquo;followes&rsquo; in the stage-direction is also twenty-seven letters.
              Surely the conclusion is that in the copy from which the play was set up
              &lsquo;followes&rsquo; came immediately after &lsquo;trenches,&rsquo;
              but in the line below. The change of the stage-direction </p>
            <p>has concealed the process of the corruption. [Reference to the <hi rend="italic"

              changes proposed in l. 60 it is, however, to be regretted that Rhodes has not made
              better use of the <hi rend="italic">Text. Notes</hi> in the Cambridge Ed. He
              attributes to modern editors the reading <hi rend="italic">followed</hi> of F<hi

              &lsquo;followes,&rsquo; which is the reading of the Clarendon editor, Wright.
              Rhodes acknowledges the correctness of this omission, but says (p. 133) a plainer
              explanation than that offered by its proposer is: &lsquo;that the book first
              contained two curt instructions for Martius Coriolanus, &ldquo;Followes&rdquo;
              and &ldquo;Enter the Gate,&rdquo; neither of which was deleted when the
              comprehensive direction [ll. 61, 62] was inserted by some reviser. It is not till the
              surviving direction that, after a skirmish, he &ldquo;enters the gate.&rdquo;
              A reviser making a text clear for readers would not have restricted his work to making
              additions without deletions. . . . &ldquo;Enter the Gate&rdquo; and
              &ldquo;Followe&rdquo; may easily have been written in the player's part, which
              conjecture justifies the assertion that <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> was an
              assembled text. The notes like &ldquo;Alarum,&rdquo; however, indicate that
              the reviser was converting his text into a prompt-book, and not merely revising it for
              printing, &ldquo;Alarum&rdquo; being an instruction for trumpets and
              drums.&rsquo;&mdash;In a letter to the Editor of <hi rend="italic">The Times

              taken from the melting-pot.&rsquo; I now believe that the figure was taken from
              the much more common <hi rend="italic">cooking-pot.</hi> Whoever looks at the word <hi
                rend="italic">pot</hi> in Littr&eacute; will see how many French phrases refer
              to the cooking-pot, and Dr Schmidt, in his <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare-Lexicon,</hi>
              seems to take the same view, for he quotes the German parallel phrase which
              Fl&uuml;gel gives as &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">in die Pfanne hauen,</hi> to put
              to the sword,&rsquo; lit. to hew into the pan. The reference is here to the
              shredding of vegetables before they are thrown into the pot to be cooked. I venture to
              think this expression is far more graphic when we thus refer it in the natural way to
              the ordinary cooking-pot. Without arguing the point further I add an unmistakable
              example from King's <hi rend="italic">Art of Cookery,</hi> first printed in 1708: <hi
                rend="bq"> &lsquo;In days of old, our father's went to war,<lb/> Expecting
                sundry blows, and hardy fare;<lb/> Their beef they often in their murrions
                stew'd,<lb/> And in their basket-hilts their beverage brew'd.<lb/> Some officer
                perhaps might give consent<lb/> To a large cover'd pipkin in his tent,<lb/> Where
                everything that every soldier got,<lb/> Fowl, bacon, cabbage, mutton, and what
                not,<lb/> Was all thrown into bank, and <hi rend="italic">went to
                pot.</hi>&rsquo;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this graphic and simple explanation I can rest satisfied. Hence, when the
              soldiers remark that Coriolanus has gone &lsquo;to the pot,&rsquo; they mean
              that he will be cut in pieces. &lsquo;The weaker goeth to the pot&rsquo;
              occurs in Heywood's <hi rend="italic">Proverbs</hi> (1562). And still more clearly, in
              Udall's translation of the <hi rend="italic">Apophthegmes of Erasmus</hi> (1564), bk
              i, Diogenes, &sect; 108: &lsquo;by the said tyranne <hi rend="italic"

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Theobald</hi>: T. Lartius is here summing up his friend's
              character, as a warrior that was terrible in his strokes, in the tone of his voice,
              and the grimness of his countenance. But who was this <hi rend="italic">Calvus,</hi>
              that wish'd these three characteristics in a soldier? I'm afraid Greek and Roman
              History will be at a loss to account for such a man and such circumstances join'd to
              signalize him. I formerly amended the passage and prov'd that the poet must have
              wrote, &lsquo;Even to Cato's wish.&rsquo; The error probably arose from the
              similitude in the manuscript of <hi rend="italic">to</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
              >lv,</hi> and so this unknown wight, Calvus, sprung up. I come now to the authorities
              for my emendation. Plutarch in the <hi rend="italic">Life of Coriolanus,</hi> speaking
              of this hero, says: &lsquo;He was a man (that which Cato requir'd in a warrior)
              not only dreadful to meet with in the field, by reason of his hand and stroke, but
              insupportable to an enemy, for the very tone and accent of his voice, and the sole
              terror of his aspect.&rsquo; This again is confirm'd by the Historian in the <hi
                rend="italic">Life of Marcus Cato, the Censor:</hi> &lsquo;In
              engagements&rsquo; (says he) &lsquo;he would use to strike lustily, with a
              fierce countenance stare upon his enemies, and with a harsh threatening voice accost
              them. Nor was he out in his opinion whilst he taught that such rugged kind of
              behaviour sometimes does strike the enemy more than the sword itself.&rsquo; Mr
              Pope owns I have clearly prov'd this point, but he seems inclin'd to think the blunder
              should rather have continued than I should have discover'd the Author guilty of such a
              terrible anachronism. But is Mr Pope conscious of no other anachronism committed by
              our Poet in this play? Menenius in one passage talks of Alexander the Great, tho that
              Prince was not born till 130 years after Coriolanus's death; nay, in another he
              mentions Galen, whose birth was above 420 years later than that of
              Alexander.&mdash;[In the foregoing note there are two statements which it may be
              interesting to elucidate. The first is where </p>
            <p>Theobald says that he had &lsquo;formerly amended&rsquo; the passage as it
              stands in his text; this refers, not to his <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare
              Restored</hi> which appeared in 1726, but to a letter written by him to Mr Matthew
              Concanen that was subsequently communicated to <hi rend="italic">Mist's Journal,</hi>
              March 16, 1727, and there printed without Theobald's permission. The second point is
              Theobald's reference to Pope. Pope's ed. ii. appeared in 1728, and in vol. viii. he
              added as an Appendix an article entitled: <hi rend="italic">Various Readings or
                Conjectures on Passages of Shakespeare.</hi> This is, in reality, a venomous attack
              on Theobald's <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare Restored.</hi> Pope, nettled by this
              demonstration of the many faults in his first edition, belittles and discounts the
              value of certain corrections. The reading <hi rend="italic">Cato's</hi> for
              &lsquo;Calvus&rsquo; is, however, the only one from the present play to which
              Pope refers, and in almost the very words Theobald quotes; Pope evidently is referring
              to the communication in <hi rend="italic">Mist's Journal</hi> of the preceding year,
              which corresponds almost word for word with the note as it later appears in Theobald's
              own edition. (See Nichol's <hi rend="italic">Illustrations,</hi> etc., vol. ii, p.
              200.) It is to this passage in the Appendix of Pope's volume that Theobald refers when
              he says that Pope accepts his emendation.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]
                &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">M. Mason</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Comments,</hi> etc.,
              p. 247): Theobald's alteration has been adopted by all the subsequent editors, who
              silently admit the charge preferred by Theobald against our author, of great
              chronological impropriety, in quoting a saying of Cato's in the days of Coriolanus;
              but the impropriety is to be imputed to the editors themselves and not to Shakespeare,
              who though he may have been guilty, upon other occasions, of crimes as great as that
              which he is now accused of, is certainly innocent of this, and has with some degree of
              art avoided the impropriety with which he is charged. He liked this saying of Cato's,
              and wished to apply it to Coriolanus, but in order to avoid the anachronism in
              question, he puts it into the mouth of a certain Calvus, who might have lived at any
              time. This is, I believe, the first time that an editor ever amended an author merely
              to make him commit a blunder.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>, in answer to
              the foregoing remark of Mason, says: &lsquo;Had Shakespeare known that Cato was
              not born till the year of Rome 519, that is, 253 years after the death of Coriolanus
              (for there is nothing in the foregoing passage to make him even <hi rend="italic"
                >suspect</hi> that was the case), and in consequence made this alteration, he would
              have attended in this particular instance to a point of which almost every page of his
              works shows that he was totally negligent; a supposition which is so improbable that I
              have no doubt the correction that has been adopted by the modern editors is right. In

                >Marcius</hi> printed instead of Lartius in the original copy.&rsquo; Malone
              concludes his note with an explanation of the misprint &lsquo;Calves&rsquo;
              for <hi rend="italic">Catoes</hi> which, as it is substantially identical with that by
              Theobald (to whom he does not refer), need not be repeated. He mentions that usually
              the possessive case of nouns ending in a vowel was formed by adding <hi rend="italic"
                >es.</hi> It is, however, somewhat curious that in the three other passages wherein
              the name &lsquo;Cato&rsquo; appears in the possessive in the Folio it is
              uniformly spelt <hi rend="italic">Cato's.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Ed.&mdash;Knight</hi>: We quite agree with Malone that the manuscript was <hi
                rend="italic">Catoes;</hi> easily mistaken and rendered by the printer
              &lsquo;Calves.&rsquo; But we do not agree with him that Shakspere committed
              the anachronism in ignorance. Shakspere puts nearly the same words [as in North's <hi
                rend="italic">Plutarch</hi>] in the mouth of Lartius; feeling that Lartius, in thus
              conveying the sentiment of Plutarch, was to the audience as a sort of chorus. He had
              no vision of a critic before him, book in hand, calling out that Cato was not born
              until two </p>
            <p>hundred and fifty years after the death of Coriolanus. Now Malone, with his exact
              chronology of the death of Coriolanus, commits in the eyes of modern learning as great
              a blunder as Shakspere commits in his eyes.&mdash;Miss <hi rend="smallcap">C.
                Porter</hi> (<hi rend="italic">First Folio Sh.</hi>): Since Niebuhr and other modern
              historians question the historicalness of Coriolanus himself, whose story is based
              only on Plutarch, who died <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> A. D. 120, and Livy, who was
              born only fifty-eight years before Christ, neither historian being regarded, by modern
              scrutiny, as unimpugnable authority for what occurred in the third century after the
              founding of Rome, the modern reader may be justified in caring even less than the Poet
              that Cato, the Censor, followed Martius Coriolanus and his associates by a mere
              century and a half. &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Gervinus</hi> (p. 768): Shakespeare
              must have known the time when Cato lived from Plutarch's <hi rend="italic"
                >C&aelig;sar.</hi> But it is possible that as he found several republican
              Brutuses, so he must have concluded there were several severe Catos. It is certain
              that he was not so early schooled in Eutropius as we are, nor had he any chronological
              dictionary to refer to in order to set himself right in his dates. Nevertheless we
              ought to consider how valuable to the poet was the brevity and suggestiveness of such
              an intimation as he puts in the mouth of Titus Lartius; it is doubtful whether, if the
              mistake had been pointed out to him, he would have corrected it, seeing it was so
              serviceable; nay, it is doubtful whether it was a mistake at all, and not rather a
              license like Goethe's when he made Faust mention Luther. There is a passage in <hi
                rend="italic">Lear</hi> which ought to make us cautious&mdash;a passage where
              the <hi rend="italic">observance</hi> of chronology constitutes a much greater license
              than the neglect of it&mdash; a passage which looks like a capital stroke of
              satire addressed to all self-opinionated and pedantic censors (a set of people not
              lacking even at the poet's time); the passage where the poet says: &lsquo;This

              <hi rend="smallcap">Orger</hi> (p. 58): There are many passages in Shakespeare which
              seem to indicate that he used &lsquo;those&rsquo; for a genitive plural, as
                <hi rend="italic">their</hi> or <hi rend="italic">theirs,</hi> which use in these
              places might be marked by an apostrophe, <hi rend="italic">those'</hi>. This has not
              been observed by Dr Abbott in his account of his pronouns, but deserves, I think,
              consideration as affording an easy solution of constructions otherwise exceedingly
              irregular, <hi rend="italic">e. g.,</hi> II, ii, 25, &lsquo;his ascent is not by
              such easy degrees as those, who,&rsquo; etc., <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> as <hi
                rend="italic">theirs who.</hi> Again, <hi rend="italic">Rich. III:</hi> I, iii, 217:
              &lsquo;If heaven have any grievous plagues in store Exceeding those that I can
              wish on thee,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> exceeding
              &lsquo;theirs,&rsquo; the plagues, viz., which she had been imprecating on the
              others, which might seem to have exhausted her power of cursing, and the line should
              be read: &lsquo;Exceeding <hi rend="italic">those'</hi> that I can wish on
              thee.&rsquo; [Does not &lsquo;those&rsquo; there refer directly to the

              in <hi rend="italic">Pericles,</hi> III, i, 1, the early copies read: &lsquo;The
              god of this great vast, rebuke these surges.&rsquo; It may be said that all these

              is that there is nothing until the pronoun &lsquo;you&rsquo; in l. 10 to
              decide whether &lsquo;the Roman gods&rsquo; is the second or third person;
              where there is no ambiguity, as in <hi rend="italic">Jul. C&aelig;s.,</hi> V, iii,

              is of details, we think Martius is less apt to be disjointed than to be at once swift
              and compact. For this reason it seems to us more in keeping with the whole to heed the
              sharp pelt of the reply closed with the colon after &lsquo;truth.&rsquo; He
              exonerates the Messenger at once, whom Cominius has just called &lsquo;that
              Slave&rsquo; and was going to reprimand for bringing false news. Then Martius goes
              on naturally in thought to the action that did in truth turn the tide from retreat to
              victory. Instead of telling this, however, which would amount to praising himself as
              one equal to the desperate situation, he blames with scorn and irony those who were
              not, namely, the would-be <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen,</hi> who, in his sense of what

              swift parentheses [see <hi rend="italic">Text. Notes</hi>]. Martius, in character and
              speech alike, is a flame. This side flare of imprecation suffers, also, in the
              modernised text from being taken out of the parentheses. His thought recurs to the
              battle-charge, when he stemmed the flight of the &lsquo;common file,&rsquo;
              cursing them as &lsquo;you heard of Byles and Plagues.&rsquo; So here, between
              breaths, as it were, he wishes these unworthy clamorers for the privileges of the
              worthy <hi rend="italic">Tribunes</hi> bringing down <hi rend="italic">a</hi> plague.
              He says it in the quickest way possible&mdash;&lsquo;(a plague-Tribunes for
              them).&rsquo; The play shows, of course, that the &lsquo;Tribunes for
              them&rsquo; did, indeed, bring down &lsquo;a plague&rsquo; in a peculiar
              sense when they caused the people to banish Valor in his person later. Surely the
              formalisms of the eighteenth century have not so deadened the minds of this century
              that they cannot see how feeble in comparison is the modernised text: &lsquo;a
              plague! Tribunes for them!&rsquo; Martius, as his poet makes him talk, hated the
              small words carrying no weight in the sentence as he hated the mob of weak men making

              <hi rend="smallcap">Heath</hi> (p. 412): This is undoubtedly nonsense. I conceive we

              first part of this line should be utter'd in a tone of surprise expressive of the
              speaker's taking shame upon himself for having thought that but one man might offer;
              the latter part of it changes to another of pleasantry, and is address'd to the
              soldiers who have got him up in their arms and are shouting; neither of these meanings
              are visible in the punctuation of former copies, to wit, a colon at
              &lsquo;me&rsquo; and a comma after &lsquo;alone.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Singer</hi> (ed. ii.): The old copy misprints &lsquo;Oh me

              scene, &lsquo;Let's along,&rsquo; and the poet's frequent use of the word in
              the same manner confirms this reading. </p>
            <p>[Through inadvertence, possibly, Singer's text reads &lsquo;Come!

              himself up in their arms, which leaves him solely waving his sword, he rapturously
              exclaims, &lsquo;Oh take me alone for weapon among you all! make yourselves a

              that I should have said &lsquo;alone!&rsquo; Both explanations seem
              inadmissible. Two emendations deserve notice: (1) that proposed by Collier
              &lsquo;of me alone?&rsquo;&mdash;adopting which it would be better to
              punctuate &lsquo;O' me alone make you a sword? O' me?&rsquo; (When everyone of
              you is as good as four Volscians, why am I your only sword? What so great need have
              you of me?); that of Singer, &lsquo;O come along&rsquo; (more Shakespearian
              would be &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Go we along</hi>&rsquo;). The sense is
              then&mdash;connecting &lsquo;Make you a sword of me&rsquo; with what
              follows&mdash;&lsquo;Use me for your sword, as now you use me&rsquo; (in a
              literal sense they had taken him in their arms), &lsquo;and every man of you (such
              men with such a leader) will be worth four Volscians.&rsquo;&mdash; <hi
                rend="smallcap">Schmidt</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> p. 71): Both
              Collier's emendation (&lsquo;Of me alone&rsquo;) and Singer's (&lsquo;O
              come along&rsquo;) are of slight probability, since according to the former we do
              not understand why Coriolanus finds so strange what has happened to him when it should
              occur to any other; according to the latter the order &lsquo;go we
              along&rsquo; has no agreement with the rest of the sentence. Perhaps the verse
              runs thus: &lsquo;Oh me! all one; make you a sword of me,&rsquo; <hi
                rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> &lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; (since <hi
                rend="italic">oh me</hi> is always an exclamation of painful or at least unpleasant
              surprise). &lsquo;Yet it is all one to me; make a sword of me and wave me as I
              order you to wave your swords.&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Make</hi> is thus the
              imperative, and the pointing of the Folio correct.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">W.
                A. Wright</hi>: I do not think any of the proposed emendations is less obscure than
              the original reading. Coriolanus is taken by surprise at the eagerness with which the
              soldiers rush forward in answer to his appeal. Instead of waving their swords in the
              air as he had directed, they make a sword of him. Instead of volunteers coming forward
              singly the whole mass would follow Coriolanus only; none would stay behind. When he
              saw this he exclaimed, &lsquo;Oh, me alone!&rsquo; and then when they raised
              him aloft, &lsquo;make you a sword of me? brandish me as if I were a
                sword?&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Rolfe</hi>: Of the various
              conjectures, that of Collier seems most probable, especially if we put it
              &lsquo;O' me alone!&rsquo; but possibly we might get the same meaning out of
              the original reading: &lsquo;What, me alone! do you make me your sword?&rsquo;
              Any interpretation of the first clause which makes it independent of the second seems
              to us inadmissible.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi> (ed. ii.): [The reading
              suggested by Whitelaw] gives about the same meaning as Singer's, and is, I think, more
              in the Poet's manner. That meaning is, of course, &lsquo;Let us proceed to the
              work; use me as your sword&rsquo;; and, as they already have the speaker in their
              arms, the language is not strained. We have repeated instances of <hi rend="italic"
              >me</hi> and <hi rend="italic">we</hi> confounded, and also of <hi rend="italic"
              >along</hi> misprinted <hi rend="italic">alone.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Perring</hi> (p. 293): I take these words to be partly a sort of gentle protest
              against the hero-worship which they were paying him, partly a preface to the remarks
              which immediately after he addresses to them. Who were these men who were now so eager
              for the fray? They were the very men who under Cominius had failed to beat the enemy;
              yet now that Coriolanus was to captain them, they made sure that they had a very
              engine of war, a talisman of victory&mdash; <hi rend="italic">they made a sword of
                him</hi>&mdash;they regarded <hi rend="italic">him</hi> as their sword, <hi
                rend="italic">him</hi> as their confidence </p>
            <p>&mdash;him and him alone. Coriolanus says not a word to damp this newly kindled
              ardour; he credits them with it, and shifts the power from himself to them; or rather
              he shares it with them; if they were the men inwardly which they showed outwardly, no
              need to set their hopes on him, and him alone; they themselves were equally with him
                <hi rend="italic">swords</hi>&mdash;terrors to the foe; not one but could be a
              match for four Volsci; not one but could front the redoubtable Aufidius himself, and
              push his shield with shield as hard.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Falcon Sh.</hi>): The first words have been variously amended, best by
              Collier, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Of</hi> me alone,&rsquo; from which
              Whitelaw, &lsquo;O' me alone,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi>
              &lsquo;Am I your only sword?&rsquo; The comma may be placed either after
              &lsquo;alone&rsquo; or after &lsquo;sword.&rsquo; [Beeching
              accordingly adopts Whitelaw's conjectural reading both in the <hi rend="italic"
              >Falcon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Henry Irving</hi> editions.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Page</hi>: The reading and
              meaning of this line are very uncertain. We print it as it stands in the old copies.
              We think it may give words supposed to be shouted by the soldiers: &lsquo;Take me
              if you take no one else&rsquo;; make me one of your soldiers. Only &lsquo;a
              certain number&rsquo; are to be selected. In the next line Coriolanus goes on with
              his speech. [Such an arrangement as this is credited to <hi rend="smallcap">Style</hi>
              by the <hi rend="smallcap">Cam. Edd.</hi> in the ed. ii.; and <hi rend="smallcap"
                >Tucker Brooke</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Yale Sh.</hi>) apparently independently
              arrives at the same conclusion. In his text he assigns this line to <hi rend="italic"
                >Soldiers</hi> and gives the next and following lines to Marcius, offering as the
              reason that &lsquo;The Folio prints the line without indication of speaker, but it
              is difficult to explain it as part of Martius's speech.&rsquo; This is, I think,
              hardly a sufficient reason for an alteration so drastic; when a stage-direction
              interrupts a speech the name of the original speaker is rarely if ever repeated in the
              Folio; see, for example, the next scene, ll. 17-20, where Aufidius's speech is broken
              by the entrance of the Volces; l. 20 is addressed to them by Aufidius without a
              repetition of his name. Also scene iv, ll. 60-64. <hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi>,
              however, regards such a distribution as possible, since &lsquo;Marcius had spoken
              of &ldquo;filling the air with swords advanc'd,&rdquo; and had said
              &ldquo;Let him, <hi rend="italic">alone.</hi>&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Herford</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Eversley Sh.</hi>): The soldiers, called upon to
              &lsquo;wave&rsquo; their swords, have proceeded to &lsquo;wave&rsquo;
                <hi rend="italic">him.</hi> He plays on the fact. &lsquo;Yes, make <hi
                rend="italic">me</hi> your weapon indeed! Follow me up as strenuously as the hand
              the sword!&rsquo; This is more in keeping with the situation than to put a (?) at
              &lsquo;me,&rsquo; as if he jocularly asked <hi rend="italic">whether they took
                him for a sword.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">E. K. Chambers</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Warwick Sh.</hi>): All emendations are quite unnecessary. Coriolanus
              protests good-humouredly against his &lsquo;chairing.&rsquo; He says:
              &lsquo;Is it me alone you &ldquo;advance&rdquo;? Advance your swords
                rather.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Student's Sh.</hi>): Where a line is taken in several ways it is seldom that any
              one is convincing; and that is the case here. First, why &lsquo;alone&rsquo;?
              It must, I think, imply, &lsquo;Why not Cominius also?&rsquo; As an old
              comrade in arms, Coriolanus deprecates the enthusiasm shown for himself at the expense
              of his superior officer. Then, what does he mean by their &lsquo;making a
              sword&rsquo; of him? He refers, of course, to the fact that the soldiers are
              holding him aloft&mdash;&lsquo;advancing&rsquo; him&mdash;as if he
              were a sword; and, on the whole, I think that his remark has no underlying reference,
              but is simply a light way of dismissing the incident and cutting short the situation.
              Such renderings [as those of Clarke and Herford] convey a note of selfassertion,
              almost of pomposity, inconsistent with Coriolanus's soldierly modesty. The pronoun <hi
                rend="italic">me</hi> in &lsquo;O, <hi rend="italic">me</hi> alone!&rsquo;
              may surely be referred to a verb easily understood from the whole context as defined
              by the preceding stage-direction. Constructions &lsquo;according to the
              sense,&rsquo; especially where the sense may be eked out by a gesture, are an
              essential part of elliptical dramatic utterance. And we must </p>
            <p>always remember that Shakespeare's plays were written to be acted.&mdash;Miss <hi
                rend="smallcap">C. Porter</hi> (<hi rend="italic">First Folio Sh.</hi>): This line
              has had a hard fate in tame minds. Martius is enraptured when he finds picked men
              willing to be served by their leader instead of needing to be goaded by him. Finding
              men with mettle like his own, he offers himself as their sole weapon to
              use&mdash;himself bodily to make a sword out of. As the rest of the excited speech
              goes, hurried with business, too, as to the selection out of these picked men of a
              smaller guard to go with him, he imagines them as forming a shield, as he himself will
              be a sword against Auffidius. This almost poetic battleecstasy in a man whose eminence
              in daring has made him know loneliness is excited by a feeling, for once, of peership
              in the fellows who are his companions at arms. The speech is completely Shakespearian,
              owing nothing to Plutarch. The text [of the Folio] best expresses it without any
              change, even of punctuation. &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Gordon</hi>: The meaning
              is, What are you for me alone? is it me alone that you will follow? And do you drop
              your swords to make me your sword instead, that you lift me thus in the
                air?&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Sherman</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Tudor Sh.</hi>):
              Many editors have considered this line obscure and in need of emendation. It makes,
              however, excellent and spirited sense as it stands in the Folio: Oh me alone, make you
              a sword of me; with a sense of exaltation excited by the instant response of the
              soldiers to his personal appeal, Coriolanus thinks of himself, borne on the shoulders
              of the troops, as an animated blade, singly invincible against the enemy.
              &lsquo;Take me alone,&rsquo; the line means as printed in the Folio,
              &lsquo;and use me like a sword.&rsquo; The introduction of the interrogation
              mark, proposed by Capell, slightly alters the mood, but not the meaning.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Deighton</hi>: I have followed Singer in reading <hi rend="italic"
                >Of</hi> for &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; though to give a stronger emphasis I have put
              a note of interrogation after &lsquo;sword&rsquo; and repeated it after
              &lsquo;me.&rsquo; The meaning seems to be: Do you by thus raising me in your
              arms, brandish me as it were your sword, the only sword you would use?&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Case</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>): If we accept Capell's
              note of interrogation at the end of this line it would appear that the soldiers'
              answer to &lsquo;Wave thus&rsquo; was to uplift Marcius, leading him to say:
              &lsquo;What, you wave <hi rend="italic">me</hi> only? You make <hi rend="italic"
                >me</hi> your sword?&rsquo; There is one objection, perhaps, in the fact that
              the stage-direction is old and shows that the stage-practice was to wave swords as
              well as to shout and take up the leader. </p>

              principles of grammar. We would suggest, &lsquo;And <hi rend="italic">those</hi>

              this passage] which puzzled the critics. And indeed, when Steevens says, &lsquo;he
              will submit the election to four indifferent persons,&rsquo; it is a poor and
              rather indifferent sense, and not at all Shakespeare-like. But there is one word more,
              which must be regarded otherwise than it has been hitherto, if we want to understand
              it&mdash;the word &lsquo;command.&rsquo; It is impossible for Coriolanus
              to &lsquo;command which men are best inclin'd,&rsquo; for inclination does not
              depend upon command; it acts without external influence. But if we understand
              &lsquo;command&rsquo; as subject, and change &lsquo;and four&rsquo;
              into <hi rend="italic">before,</hi> the sense of the phrase seems very clear:
              &lsquo;Before you march my command shall quickly draw out those which are best
              inclined.&rsquo;&mdash;[Since Leo does not refer to Collier's MS. Corrector it
              is to be presumed that he was unaware that he is anticipated in a portion of his
              emendation. Ulrici, in his <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> on Herwegh's translation,
              wherein the translator adopts Leo's reading, speaks in commendation of the change
              since it departs so little from the original text, although the words
              &lsquo;Please you march before&rsquo; seem to be in slight agreement with what
              follows. Ulrici is therefore in favor of Johnson's reading in spite of its divergence,
              since the order for them to march is in strict accord with the reason as given by
                Johnson.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              intelligible enough as it stands. Of course the meaning is, that Marcius, in order to
              save time, will delegate to certain men the office of selecting, for the body he </p>
            <p>is to command, such as have most heart for a post of special danger.&mdash;[In

              this line. He says, &lsquo;I cannot imagine&mdash;it seems that nobody
              can&mdash;what business &ldquo;four&rdquo; has there.&rsquo; In regard
              to Singer's substitution Hudson declares that it is &lsquo;better than
              &ldquo;four,&rdquo; but far from satisfactory&rsquo;; and of Lettsom's

              The next line [104] can hardly be correct, since all the soldiers had just
              enthusiastically expressed their eagerness to go on the required service. There could
              consequently be no question raised by the general as to which men were &lsquo;best
              inclin'd.&rsquo; A suggestion that occurred to me, after a long pause on these
              difficulties, presents, if I mistake not, an easy solution of the puzzle. I propose to
              read: &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Fortune</hi> shall quickly draw out my command
              Which men are best <hi rend="italic">included.</hi>&rsquo; By these alterations,
              with what goes before, Martius in fact says: &lsquo;I must select a certain
              number; but as all are equally willing, it would be invidious in me to make a personal
              choice, and I therefore commit the affair to fortune, who shall decide which troops it
              will be best to include in my command. The matter shall be quickly determined by
              lot.&rsquo; It may be added that the first emendation is not at all dependent on
              the second (which I conceive is more doubtful), but may be adopted without it. The
              latter, indeed, is scarcely superior to several others, especially to this:
              &lsquo;Which men she best inclines to.&rsquo; A passage in <hi rend="italic"
                >King John,</hi> which has nothing, however, to do with drawing lots, is worth
              citing for the similar cast of expression: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;Then in a moment
                fortune shall call forth<lb/> Out of one side her happy minion,<lb/> To whom in

              proceed quickly several must undertake it, and wherefore not four? These four are not
              named, but Coriolanus, on account of the foregoing demonstration and the nature of
              their friendly acclamations, submits all to the free choice: &lsquo;which men are
              best inclined&rsquo; (to refer it to <hi rend="italic">four,</hi> not to the <hi
                rend="italic">command</hi>). &lsquo;Command&rsquo; here means the company
              who shall be <hi rend="italic">under the command</hi> of Coriolanus.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi>: It has been generally assumed that this line is
              corrupt and many efforts have been made to emend it. But is it so certain that there
              is a corruption? Coriolanus deputes to four officers the task of selecting the men who
              are to go with him. And why four? To which question the only answer is, why not?
              &lsquo;Four&rsquo; is elsewhere used of an indefinite small number. See <hi
                rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> II, ii, 160: &lsquo;You know sometimes he walks four
              hours together Here in the lobby.&rsquo; It is hardly likely that Coriolanus would
              leave to volunteers the selection of the picked men [as suggested by
                Schmidt].&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Wordsworth</hi> (<hi rend="italic"

              &lsquo;no good explanation of them has been given, the text being probably
              corrupt.&rsquo; Wordsworth in quoting the lines introduces, however, a new
              reading, &lsquo;And <hi rend="italic">force</hi> shall quickly draw out my

              rather look for an explanation of the difficulty [as regards the word
              &lsquo;four&rsquo;] in the notion which Shakespeare entertained of the
              organization of the army. He speaks of the
              &lsquo;centuries&rsquo;&mdash;the &lsquo;centurions&rsquo;
              &mdash;of the Volsci; there cannot be a doubt that he conceived the Roman army as
              similarly divided; the number &lsquo;four&rsquo; indicates with sufficient
              exactness the modest number that Coriolanus was content should accompany him on his
              errand of danger&mdash;<hi rend="italic">four hundred men and their four
              officers</hi>&mdash;Voil&agrave; tout, Soldiers would understand, if scholars
                cannot.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Page</hi>: That is, four officers appointed by
              me. Those who object to the particular number <hi rend="italic">four</hi> might with
              equal reason object to any other Coriolanus thought fit to name. To save time the men
              are to be selected as they march along.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">E. K.
              Chambers</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Warwick Sh.</hi>): There seems no reason for altering
              the Folio text. The &lsquo;four&rsquo; are the subordinate officers to whom
              Coriolanus assigns the duty of picking out his command.&mdash;[The majority of
              modern editors follow Mason's interpretation as regards the meaning of l. 103, <hi
                rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> that Marcius will depute to four men the selection of
              those fittest to accompany him. At first sight this would seem the simplest
              interpretation of the words as they stand in the Folio text&mdash;as regards the
              many emendations we need not concern ourselves at present&mdash;but if it be the
              simplest is it of necessity the best? To me, at least, it is quite out of character
              with the speaker. Why should he leave to others a task which he has just announced
              that he himself would undertake? &lsquo;A certain number must I select from
              all&rsquo; are the words preceding this announcement. In making
              &lsquo;command&rsquo; and not &lsquo;four&rsquo; the subject to the
              verb &lsquo;draw&rsquo; Keightley and Leo were, I think, nearer a correct
              interpretation: that is, My command will quickly draw out four of those who are best
              suited to the purpose&mdash;or rather: March past; and four of those best fitted
              to my purpose will very quickly determine my choice. The certain number which he
              needed was but four men. With this interpretation there is no need of any change of

              <hi rend="smallcap">Capell</hi> (vol. I, pt i, p. 84): Meaning the envy excited by it;
              thy envy'd fame; the fame which all other men by myself view with envy; the expression
              is figurative and of the same nature with one in <hi rend="italic">Ant. &amp;
                Cleo.,</hi> [IV, ii, 44, &lsquo;Where rather I'll expect victorious life Than
              death and honour.&rsquo; Where &lsquo;death and honour&rsquo; is
              equivalent to <hi rend="italic">honourable death.</hi>]&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap"
                >Malone</hi>: &lsquo;Envy&rsquo; here, as in many other places, means <hi
                rend="italic">malice.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: The phrase
                <hi rend="italic">death and honour</hi> being allowed, in our author's language, to
              signify no more than <hi rend="italic">honourable death,</hi> so &lsquo;fame and
              envy&rsquo; may only mean <hi rend="italic">detested</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                >odious fame.</hi> The verb &lsquo;to envy,&rsquo; in ancient language,
              signifies <hi rend="italic">to hate.</hi> Or the construction may be, &lsquo;Not
              Africk owns a serpent I more abhor and envy than thy &longs;ame.&rsquo;
                &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Notes &amp;
                Emend.,</hi> etc., p. 350): This cannot be right, inasmuch as, taking
              &lsquo;envy&rsquo; even in the sense of hate, Aufidius could hardly mean that
              he abhorred the fame and the hate of Marcius; the printer made a slight error by
              mistaking the pronoun <hi rend="italic">I</hi> for the contraction of the conjunction;
              therefore the MS. Corrector reads, &lsquo;More than thy fame <hi rend="italic"
              >I</hi> envy.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Singer</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Sh. Vindicated,</hi> etc., p. 212) thus comments on the foregoing remark by
              Collier: &lsquo;All that is required, without interpolation, is to understand the
              passage properly as an inversion: Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor&mdash;More than
              thy fame&mdash;and envy. Afric owns not a serpent I abhor and hate more than thy
              fame. Shakespeare's meaning of </p>
            <p>&ldquo;envy&rdquo; may be understood from Baret, who explains &ldquo;to
              envie, to have spite at another man's prosperitie.&rdquo; From the tenour of the
              dialogue the speech requires an expression of more than
              &ldquo;envy&rdquo;&mdash;fierce hatred.&rsquo; [It will be noticed
              that this is substantially Steevens's explanation, whose note on this Singer prints,
              without acknowledgement, in his editions.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Staunton</hi>: There is probably some
              corruption in this line, which would better read, &lsquo;More than thy fame <hi
                rend="italic">I hate</hi> and envy.&rsquo; So, in Plutarch, &lsquo;Martius
              knew very well that Tullus did more malice and envy him than he did all the Romans
                besides.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi> (ed. ii.): Collier is
              probably right in observing that &lsquo;the compositor mistook <hi rend="italic"
              >I</hi> for the contraction for &ldquo;and.&rdquo;&rsquo; Whether Malone's
              or Steevens's explanation of the Folio reading be the most ridiculous is doubtful.
              Staunton's suggestion would make the line over-measure. Here
              &lsquo;envy&rsquo; means <hi rend="italic">hate, bear ill will
                to.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi>: The construction commonly put
              upon the passage is: &lsquo;Not Afric owns a serpent that I more abhor and envy
              than I do thy fame, &lsquo;envy&rsquo; being interpreted in the old sense of
                <hi rend="italic">hate.</hi> But why should Aufidius profess to abhor and hate the
              fame of Marcius? when the plain truth is that he <hi rend="italic">desires</hi> or <hi
                rend="italic">covets</hi> his fame, and therefore <hi rend="italic">envies</hi> him
              the possession of it. We adopt, with little hesitation, a correction from Collier's
              second folio.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">C. &amp; M. Cowden Clarke</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi>): It appears to us that the sentence means
              &lsquo;Not Africa owns a serpent I abhor more than thy fame and hatred of
              me&rsquo;&mdash;that hatred which Marcius has just professed.&mdash;Rev.

              towards me.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Schmidt</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
              >Coriolanus,</hi> p. 73) asks what could have forced the poet to adopt any such
              construction as that suggested by Steevens in his alternative explanation, and
              therefore considers that the proper view of the case is that &lsquo;fame and
              envy&rsquo; here mean <hi rend="italic">odious fame.</hi>&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi>: Steevens rightly explains this as an instance of
              the grammatical figure, hendiadys, in which one idea is expressed by two different
              words. His second thoughts are not best. The First Folio prints
              &lsquo;fame&rsquo; and &lsquo;envy&rsquo; with initial capitals to
              show that they were both regarded as substantives.&mdash;Miss <hi rend="smallcap"
                >C. Porter</hi> (<hi rend="italic">First Folio Sh.</hi>): That is, thy fame and envy
              of mine. Each being fixed by the consciousness that the other was the most valiant
              leader on his side must hate both this eminence and its discount of his own supremacy.
              Hence the double expression.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Henry Irving Sh.</hi>) quotes Steevens's explanation, but adds that
              &lsquo;more probably &ldquo;envy&rdquo; is a verb parallel to
              &ldquo;abhor.&rdquo;&rsquo; Beeching does not repeat this alternative
              explanation in his later edition (<hi rend="italic">The Falcon

              mean the whip with which the Trojans scourged the Greeks, which cannot be but by a
              very unusual construction, or the author must have forgotten the original of the
              Romans; unless &lsquo;whip&rsquo; has some meaning which includes <hi

                >Malone</hi>: Dr Johnson considers this as a very unusual construction, but it
              appears to me only such as every page of these plays furnishes; and the foregoing
              interpretation is undoubtedly the true one. An anonymous correspondent justly observes
              that the words mean, &lsquo;the whip that your bragg'd progeny <hi rend="italic"
                >was possessed of.</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>:
              &lsquo;Whip&rsquo; might anciently be used, as <hi rend="italic">crack</hi> is
              now, to denote anything peculiarly boasted of, as the <hi rend="italic">crack</hi>
              house in the county, the <hi rend="italic">crack</hi> boy of a school, &amp;c.
              Modern phraseology, perhaps, has only passed from the <hi rend="italic">whip</hi> to
              the <hi rend="italic">crack</hi> of it. [The foregoing is, I think, an instance of
              Steevens's love of mischief, and is hardly to be taken as meant seriously. In the <hi
                rend="italic">Variorum</hi> editions of '78 and '85 Malone's only note on this
              passage is: &lsquo;Schoolboys at this day use a similar expression, &ldquo;He
              is the <hi rend="italic">crack</hi> of the school.&rdquo;&rsquo; It is not
              repeated in any subsequent edition; and Steevens is thus, with mock seriousness,
              supplying a derivation for Malone's inappropriate illustration.&mdash;<hi

                rend="italic">Comments,</hi> etc., p. 248): The <hi rend="italic">whip</hi> is a
              New-Market phrase. I am not much versed in sporting terms, but I believe the owner of
              the best horse of his year is said to hold the whip, and has actually a whip consigned
              to his keeping. [It is somewhat unusual for Mason to display such a complete lack of
              sagacity as in the foregoing. The use of &lsquo;whip&rsquo; in any such sense
              as he suggests is utterly unknown before the end of the eighteenth
                century.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Keightley</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Expositor,</hi> p. 361): Here

              >Ulrici</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Zus&auml;tze und Berichtigungen</hi>): Shakespeare
              assuredly well knew that the Romans boasted their descent from the Trojans, therefore
              &lsquo;whip&rsquo; can here be meant only in the same sense as in <hi
                rend="italic">Love's Labour's Lost,</hi> &lsquo;love's whip&rsquo; (III, i,
              176), and in <hi rend="italic">All's Well,</hi> &lsquo;his presence must be the
              whip of the other&rsquo; (IV, iii, 42); that is, Aufidius calls Hector the scourge
              with which the Trojans lashed the Greeks.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">W. A.
              Wright</hi>: This must mean, unless Shakespeare had entirely forgotten about Hector,
              the whip with which the Trojans flogged the Greeks. &lsquo;Progeny&rsquo; is
              used for <hi rend="italic">race</hi> generally, as in <hi rend="italic">1 Henry
              VI:</hi> V, iv, 48: &lsquo;Not one begotten of a shepherd swain, But issued of a

                rend="italic">Warwick Sh.</hi>): The &lsquo;bragg'd progeny&rsquo; is, of
              course, the Trojans, from whom the Romans claimed descent. Hector was the Trojan
              &lsquo;whip&rsquo; or champion. But the taunt would be more effective if
              Aufidius swore &lsquo;by him who </p>
            <p>whipped your ancestors.&rsquo; Has he confused Hector and Achilles?&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Kinnear</hi> (p. 306) reads <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> instead of
              &lsquo;whip,&rsquo; furnishing several examples from other plays wherein
              Hector and others are spoken of as the <hi rend="italic">hope of their country</hi> or
                <hi rend="italic">party.</hi> Kinnear boldly maintains that the Folio reading is a
              misprint which must mean here &lsquo;the <hi rend="italic">whipper
              of,</hi>&rsquo; as in <hi rend="italic">1 Henry VI:</hi> I, ii, 129:
              &lsquo;Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.&rsquo; Again, <hi
                rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> II, iii, 15: &lsquo;Is this the scourge of France, Is
              this the Talbot?&rsquo; &lsquo;The exception is,&rsquo; he adds,
              &lsquo;when applied to heaven. So <hi rend="italic">Timon,</hi> V, i, 64,
              &ldquo;all the whips of heaven&rdquo;; or to <hi rend="italic">deities</hi>
              and <hi rend="italic">personified powers,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> III,
              i, 70, &ldquo;the whips and scorns of time.&rdquo; So Attila is &ldquo;The

                rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student' Sh.</hi>): The natural sense
              would be &lsquo;the scourge of your progeny&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">i.
              e.,</hi> he by whom they were scourged), but here the meaning must be either
              &lsquo;the whip possessed by your ancestors&rsquo; or (less precisely)
              &lsquo;the champion of.&rsquo; It is very improbable that Shakespeare confused
              Hector with any Greek hero such as Achilles; for <hi rend="italic">Tro. &amp;
                Cress.,</hi> without doubt, preceded <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> and in <hi
                rend="italic">Tro. &amp; Cress.</hi> all the great figures of the Trojan War, on
              either side, are introduced&mdash;Achilles, Hector, Agamemnon, and other of the
              Homeric heroes. The story of the Fall of Troy was the most popular of all classical
              legends, and had called into being a vast cycle of medi&aelig;val poems, romances,
              and &lsquo;histories&rsquo; such as the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century <hi
                rend="italic">Roman de Troyes</hi> and its English counterparts the <hi
                rend="italic">TroyBook</hi> of Lydgate and Caxton's <hi rend="italic">Destruction of
                Troy.</hi> No tolerably educated Elizabethan (and the old conception of Shakespeare
              as an inspired ignoramus is surely extinct) could possibly have mixed up Hector and
                Achilles.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Deighton</hi>: This must mean, as Johnson
              says, &lsquo;the whip with which the Trojans scourged the Greeks.&rsquo; But
              the expression is a very strange one; and it looks, if one dared to say so, as though
              Shakespeare had confounded Hector and Achilles, for Aufidius would hardly compliment
              Coriolanus on the prowess of his ancestor.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi>
                (<hi rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>): The sense must be as Johnson put it,
              &lsquo;the whip with which the Trojans scourged the Greeks&rsquo; or, the
              primitive weapon of your boasted forefathers. Chambers's remark [as to greater
              effectiveness in the taunt] is beside the mark. Aufidius does not <hi rend="italic"
                >swear by anybody;</hi> he says, If you were the most famous and formidable warrior
              of the race you brag of you should not escape me now. [I do not believe that
              Shakespeare was in the least confused as to the identity of Hector; have we not
              sufficient proof of his complete understanding on this point in the fact that in scene
              iii. he puts into the mouth of Volumnia the reference to Hector's contending against
              Grecian swords? That the word &lsquo;contending&rsquo; has been questioned is
              not to the purpose here; it is the word &lsquo;Grecian&rsquo; that shows that
              Shakespeare recognised Hector as one of the Trojan warriors.&mdash;<hi

              and noble nature to be openly and fulsomely praised. It may, however, be asked whether
              the deprecation of such praise does not afford a greater satisfaction to the
              self-consciousness. It may well be that what Marcius here says is truly
              meant&mdash;and assuredly he is not one to seek praise, or is in the least as the
              Tribune Brutus and, later, Aufidius call him, a braggart&mdash;but he would
              perhaps have felt wounded in his self-love had his deeds and deserts remained quite
              unnoticed. At all events his behaviour on this occasion throws a very clear light on
              his bearing later in the Senate and on his candidature for the Consulate. Here once
              again he allows to the soldiers of the people a certain recognition and reference to
              their own feelings, which is contrary to Plutarch, who makes no reference to this at

              With all deference to Steevens I must say that the parallelism between these two
              passages is of the slightest, and the idea conveyed is totally different; here
              Cominius remonstrates with Marcius for his modesty, and asks that he be allowed to
              tell the army the real state of affairs before Marcius rewards, or praises, what he

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Theobald</hi>: Many of the verses in this really fine passage are
              dismounted, unnumerous and imperfect. For this reason I have ventured to transpose
              them to their measure; and the sense, 'tis plain, has been no less maimed than the
              numbers. To remedy this part I have had the assistance of my ingenious friend Mr
              Warburton; and with the benefit of his happy conjectures, which I have inserted in the
              text, the whole, I hope, is restored to that purity which was quite lost in the
              corruptions. I shall now subjoin his comment in proof of the emendations:
              &lsquo;The meaning that sense requires in the antithesis evidently designed here
              is this: If one change its usual nature to a thing most opposite, then let the other
              do so too. But Courts and Cities, being made all of smooth-fac'd soothing, remain in
              their proper nature. In the second part of the sentence the antithesis between steel
              and the parasite's silk does not indeed labour with this absurdity, but it labours
              with another equally bad, and that is, Nonsense in the expression. The Poet's whole
              thought seems to be this: If drums and trumpets <hi rend="italic">change their nature
                preposterously, let</hi> Camps <hi rend="italic">do so too.</hi> And in the latter
              part of the sentence the emendation seems to give a particular beauty to the
              expression. He had said before, If drums and trumpets prove flatterers; now here,
              alluding to the same thought, he says, <hi rend="italic">Then let</hi> Hymns, <hi
                rend="italic">soft music</hi> destined to the praises of gods and heroes, be an
              overture for the wars; where the overture is used with great technical propriety. I
              should observe one thing, that the members of these two antitheses are confounded one
              with another, which is a practice common with the best authors; and it is a figure
              Rhetoricians have found a name for.&rsquo; [In his own edition, fourteen years

              following paraphrase: When flattery shall creep into camps, let it be no shame for
              cities and courts to use it; let the practice be general there, be they &lsquo;all
              made of false-fac'd soothing&rsquo;; and when this happens, that soldiers shall
              have the softness of parasites, let them be consistent and do other soft things; forgo
              the drum and the trumpet and march to battle to the sound of soft musics, let the
              overture to fight be a hymn.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Tyrwhitt</hi>: The first
              part of the passage has been altered, in my opinion, unnecessarily by Dr Warburton;
              and the latter not so happily, I think, as he often conjectures. In the latter part,
              which only I mean to consider, instead of &lsquo;him&rsquo; (an evident
              corruption) he substitutes <hi rend="italic">hymns;</hi> which perhaps may palliate,
              but certainly has not cured, the wounds of the sentence. I would propose an alteration
              of two words: &lsquo;When steel grows Soft as the parasite's silk, let <hi
                rend="italic">this</hi> (i. e., silk) be made A <hi rend="italic">coverture</hi> for
              the wars!&rsquo; The sense will then be apt and complete. When <hi rend="italic"
                >steel</hi> grows soft as <hi rend="italic">silk,</hi> let armour be made of silk
              instead of <hi rend="italic">steel.</hi> &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>:
              It should be remembered that the personal pronoun &lsquo;him&rsquo; is not
              unfrequently used by our author and other writers of his age instead of <hi
                rend="italic">it,</hi> the neuter; and that overture, in its musical sense, is not
              so ancient as the age of Shakespeare. What Martial has said of Mucius
              Sc&aelig;vola may, however, be applied to Dr Warburton's proposed emendation:
              &lsquo;Si non errasset, fecerat ille minus,&rsquo; [Bk I, <hi rend="italic"
                >Epigram,</hi> xxi.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: Bullokar, in his <hi rend="italic">English
              Expositor,</hi> 1616, interprets the word &lsquo;overture&rsquo; thus:
              &lsquo;An overturning; a sudden change.&rsquo; The latter sense suits the
              present passage sufficiently well, understanding the word &lsquo;him&rsquo; to
              mean <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> as Mr Steevens has very properly explained it. When
              steel grows soft as silk, let silk be <hi rend="italic">suddenly converted</hi> to the
              use of war. We have many expressions equally licentious in these plays. By
              &lsquo;steel&rsquo; Marcius means a <hi rend="italic">coat of mail.</hi> So,
              in <hi rend="italic">3 Henry VI:</hi> &lsquo;Shall we go throw away our coats of
              steel And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,&rsquo; [II, i, 160].
              Shakespeare has introduced a similar image in <hi rend="italic">Rom. &amp;
              Jul.,</hi> &lsquo;Thy beauty hath made me effeminate, And in my temper soften'd
              valour's steel,&rsquo; [III, i, 120]. &lsquo;Overture,&rsquo; I have
              observed since this note was written, was used by the writers of Shakespeare's time in
              the sense of <hi rend="italic">prelude</hi> or <hi rend="italic">preparation.</hi> It
              is so used by Sir John Davies and Philemon Holland. So, in <hi rend="italic">Twelfth

              should read <hi rend="italic">coverture.</hi> Notwithstanding Malone's ingenious
              argument, it is impossible to extract sense from the word
              &lsquo;overture,&rsquo; which anciently, as now, meant &lsquo;a motion, or
              offer made, an opening or entrance.&rsquo; [Singer does not, however, adopt

              alterations which he suggests in the passage are the substitution of a full stop after
              &lsquo;soothing,&rsquo; l. 57, for the colon of the Folio, and reading <hi

              &lsquo;silk&rsquo; and &lsquo;him.&rsquo; The former of these Collier

              notes of explanation [on this passage]; and they leave the matter more involved than
              they found it. The stage-direction of the original which precedes this speech is
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">A long flourish.</hi>&rsquo; The drums and trumpets
              have sounded in honour of Coriolanus; but displeased as he may be, it is somewhat
              unreasonable of him to desire that these instruments may &lsquo;never sound
              more.&rsquo; We render his desire, by the slightest change of punctuation,
              somewhat more rational: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;May these same instruments, which
                you profane,<lb/> Never sound more, when drums and trumpets shall<lb/> I' the field

            </p>
            <p>The difficulty increases with the received reading; for, according to this, when
              drums and trumpets prove flatterers, courts and cities are to be made of falsefaced
              soothing. Courts and cities are precisely what a soldier would describe as invariably
              so made. But Coriolanus <hi rend="italic">contrasts</hi> courts and cities with the
              field; he separates them: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;Let courts and cities be<lb/> Made
                all of false-faced soothing&rsquo;;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>and he adds, as we believe, <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Where</hi>

              </hi>

            <p>The difficulties with the received reading are immeasurable. <hi rend="italic"
              >When</hi> steel grows soft as the parasite's silk the commentators say that <hi

              made an <hi rend="italic">overture</hi> for the wars; but what
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; means here they do not attempt to explain. The slight
              change we have made gives a perfectly clear meaning. The whole speech has now a
              leading idea&mdash;&lsquo;Let them be made an overture for the
              wars.&rsquo; Let them, the instruments which you profane, be the <hi rend="italic"
                >prelude</hi> to our wars. Opposed as we are to editorial licence, we hold ourselves
              keeping within due bounds in substituting <hi rend="italic">where</hi> for
              &lsquo;when&rsquo; and <hi rend="italic">them</hi> for
              &lsquo;him,&rsquo; for there are several instances of these words having been
              misprinted in the original copies. We believe that the sense of these lines has been
              mistaken, in some measure, through the deviations from the metrical arrangements in
              the original. Our reading follows this arrangement much more closely than that of the
              modern editors.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> (ed. i.): We do not think
              that any of the modern explanations [of this passage] have quite arrived at the full
              sense of the poet. We regulate the passage as in the First Folio, and, adhering, with
              a slight exception, to the words of the original, we only adopt a different
              punctuation. The meaning of Coriolanus seems to be: &lsquo;Let drums and trumpets
              never sound more if they are to be profaned by you into flatterers; leave it to courts
              and cities to be made of false-faced soothing, when steel grows soft as the parasite's
              silk; but let them (drums and </p>
            <p>trumpets) be made a prelude to the wars.&rsquo; We do not see the necessity of
              any change but of &lsquo;him&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">them,</hi> in which
              we follow Knight.&mdash;[Collier concludes his note with a reference to Tyrwhitt's
              changes, both of which he rejects, since wherever it is possible to make sense of the
              Folio reading it should be retained. In his second ed. Collier refers to these same
              emendations as comparatively small, adopting them both, and remarking that they
              &lsquo;make the whole meaning of the passage . . . as evident as it is
              excellent.&rsquo; His paraphrase of the passage is substantially the same as in
              his ed. i, except that he concludes it thus: &lsquo;when steel becomes as soft as
              the parasite's silk, it is fit that silk should be applied to the purposes of
              armour&mdash;&ldquo;a coverture for the wars.&rdquo; When steel becomes
              soft, silk, on the other hand, ought to become hard; and silk was just as well adapted
              to defend as steel ought to be capable of flattery. If we were at all authorised to
              read &ldquo;silk&rdquo; in the plural, it would not be necessary even to alter
                <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to &ldquo;it.&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;This
              last is a slight inadvertence; the original is &lsquo;him&rsquo; not <hi
                rend="italic">them.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Anon.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Blackwood's Maga.,</hi> Sep., 1853, p.
              321): The punctuation of this passage requires to be put right. Coriolanus is
              declaring how much disgusted he is with the flatteries, the flourish of trumpets, and
              other demonstrations of applause with which he is saluted. But what is the sense of
              saying let courts and cities be made of hypocrisy, <hi rend="italic">when</hi> drums
              and trumpets in the field shall prove flatterers? This has no meaning. We should
              punctuate the lines thus: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;May these same instruments which
                you profane,<lb/> Never sound more, when drums and trumpets shall<lb/> I' the fields
                prove flatterers. Let courts and cities be<lb/> Made all of false-faced
                soothing,&rsquo; &amp;c.<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning is: When drums and trumpets in the field shall prove flatterers (as they
              are doing at present), may they never sound more! Let <hi rend="italic">courts</hi>
              and <hi rend="italic">cities</hi> be as hollow-hearted as they please; but let the
              camp enjoy an immunity from these fulsome observances. When steel grows soft as the
              parasite's silk (that is, when the warrior loses his stubborn and unbending
              character), let silk be made a coverture for the wars, for it will then be quite as
              useful as steel.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Delius</hi>: Coriolanus execrates the
              drums and trumpets, since they are profaned in sounding forth in his honor, and then
              continues, if these turn into flatterers in the field then may courts and cities
              (which are here set in contrast to the field) well consist of false soothing. If the
              steel, in which soldiers are clad, becomes as soft as the silken coat of the parasite,
              then let it (the silken coat or the parasite) serve as a prelude to war; the
              steel-clad soldiers shall resign the work of war to the silken clad parasite. If
              Shakespeare refers &lsquo;him&rsquo; to &lsquo;silk,&rsquo; and not to
              parasite, then &lsquo;silk&rsquo; is here to be understood as
                personified.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Singer</hi> (ed. ii.): Various attempts
              have been made to extract a meaning from this passage, and very many various readings
              have been proposed. Tyrwhitt would read <hi rend="italic">coverture,</hi> but
              Shakespeare uses the word <hi rend="italic">coverture</hi> only for a <hi
                rend="italic">concealment,</hi> and has an &lsquo;overture&rsquo; in the
              sense here attached to it elsewhere. I have left the passage as it stands in the
              Folio. The leading thought seems to be: &lsquo;When drums, trumpets, and warlike
              instruments are profaned, let them lose their functions&mdash;never sound more,
              and let their places be taken by something else.&rsquo; I should, however, prefer
              to read and point thus: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;May these same instruments, which
                you profane,<lb/> Never sound more! shall drums and trumpets, when<lb/>
              </hi>
              <hi rend="bq"> I' the field prove flatterers? (Let courts and cities be<lb/> Made all
                of false-faced soothing<lb/> When steel grows soft as the parasite's
                silk)&mdash;<lb/> Let <hi rend="italic">them</hi> be made an overture for the
                wars!&mdash;<lb/> No more! I say,&rsquo; &amp;c.<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>&lsquo;When,&rsquo; I think, stands for <hi rend="italic">where</hi> or <hi
                rend="italic">in which place,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">them</hi> relates to the
              martial instruments. It is &lsquo;him&rsquo; in the old copy, but, as Mr Dyce
              has remarked, &lsquo;The words <hi rend="italic">him</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                >them</hi> are very often confounded by our early printers&rsquo; (Marlowe's <hi
                rend="italic">Works,</hi> vol. i, p. lxxvi.).&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Dyce</hi>: I read, with Tyrwhitt, <hi rend="italic">a coverture,</hi> for I cannot
              but think that the commentators have most signally failed in their endeavors to
              support the old lection; and nothing can be more ridiculous than Malone's adducing in
              its defence, from <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night,</hi> &lsquo;no <hi
                rend="italic">overture of war,</hi>&rsquo; as if that expression were parallel
              to &lsquo;an overture for the wars&rsquo;!&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Halliwell</hi> accepts Tyrwhitt's emendation since &lsquo;no good sense can be
              made out of the old text.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Badham</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Text of Sh.,</hi> p. 288): Some have changed &lsquo;him&rsquo;
              [l. 59] to <hi rend="italic">them,</hi> but I believe <hi rend="italic">him</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> the steel) to be right. Adopting Tyrwhitt's conjecture of
              &lsquo;a <hi rend="italic">coverture,</hi>&rsquo; and changing the punctuation
              still further, we come to the very simple and intelligible expression: <hi rend="bq">
                . . . &lsquo;When steel grows<lb/> Soft as the parasite's silk, let him be
                made<lb/> A coverture for the wars no more,&rsquo;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>which exactly answers to the preceding &lsquo;May these same instruments <hi
                rend="italic">never sound more.</hi>&rsquo; And this very repetition of thought
              in a different metaphor will account for the words &lsquo;I say.&rsquo; But
              where are they to be placed? Not at the end, where they come in most languidly, but
              after &lsquo;let him,&rsquo; the words &lsquo;be made&rsquo; being
              removed to the commencement of the next verse.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Walker</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Crit.,</hi> iii, 208) agrees with Knight in changing
              &lsquo;him&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">them,</hi> and with Collier in changing
              &lsquo;silk&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">silks;</hi> he further elucidates:
              &lsquo;&ldquo;Overture&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;the parasite's <hi
                rend="italic">silks</hi>&rdquo;<hi rend="italic">;</hi> let them, in lieu of
              mail, be made an overture (<hi rend="italic">clothing, covering;</hi> compare <hi
                rend="italic">coverture</hi>) for the wars! . . . The omission of the final <hi
                rend="italic">s,</hi> though not so common as [its addition], is not infrequent in
              the Folio.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Staunton</hi>: If an alteration be
              absolutely needed, that of <hi rend="italic">coverture</hi> for
              &lsquo;overture,&rsquo; understanding &lsquo;him&rsquo; to be used for
              the neuter <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> is the least objectionable; but we are strongly
              disposed to think that &lsquo;overture,&rsquo; if not a misprint for <hi
                rend="italic">ovation,</hi> is employed here in the same sense, and that the meaning
              is: When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk, let him be made, i. e., <hi
                rend="italic">let there be made for him,</hi> a triumph, as for a successful
                warrior.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">R. G. White</hi>: To Tyrwhitt's reading there
              is the paramount objection that any soldier, and Coriolanus of all soldiers, would
              regard courts and cities as made all of false-faced soothing, whether drums and
              trumpets were used as instruments of flattery or not. Especially would he so speak of
              them under the circumstances of this occasion. And as to making either steel or silk a
                <hi rend="italic">coverture</hi> for the wars, what possible connection is there
              between armor, or any soldierly equipment, and the flourish against which Coriolanus
              is protesting? These considerations, as well as the reading to which they lead, I
              supposed to have occurred first to myself, but I found them substantially given in
              Knight's <hi rend="italic">Pictorial Edition.</hi> (I may add that at first I thought
              of reading also &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">where</hi> drums and trumpets&rsquo; </p>
            <p>and &lsquo;as the <hi rend="italic">parasite,</hi> silk.&rsquo;) The only
              objection to the reading of the Folio text (and it is a great one) is its rhythm,
              which is, in my judgment, both unShakespearian and unsuited to the mood of Coriolanus.
              There must be a pause after &lsquo;Never sound more&rsquo;; and it would be in
              Shakespeare's manner of versification and especially appropriate to Coriolanus that
              the exclamation should come there to a full period. The prolongation of the first
              sentence of the speech, by an accessory clause, into the middle of the next line
              enfeebles both the protest and the verse. And the next sentence is measurably open to
              the same objection. But the rhythm of the whole speech with any arrangement is far
              from being unexceptionable. In the Folio we have a hemistich of seven syllables and
              three accents, followed by a line of ten syllables and four accents, which certainly
              indicates corruption of the text or derangement of the verse.&mdash;<hi

              &lsquo;him&rsquo; in l. 59 can only be meant the parasite, and what is the
              meaning of his being &lsquo;an overture for the wars&rsquo;? I feel convinced
              that it is a printer's error for a noun; and I read <hi rend="italic">pipes,</hi>
              which might be thus mistaken. The meaning then would be, when things are so, let pipes
              and tabors, not trumpets and drums, be used in our armies grown thus effeminate.

              >Verplanck</hi> gives Knight's remarks on this passage in full, adding in conclusion,
              &lsquo;Thus the whole sum is: &ldquo;Let trumpets and drums cease to sound
              when they become flatterers in the field. Let falsehood and flatterers have the rule
              in courts and cities, where even steel becomes soft as the parasite's silk. But let
              martial music be the prelude only to war.&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi> (ed. i.): That is, let the instruments of music be used
              as a prelude to battle. The passage has caused a great deal of discussion, and as
              commonly given it seems impossible to make any sense out of it. The only tolerable
              explanation of the Folio reading is that &lsquo;him&rsquo; is used for <hi
                rend="italic">it,</hi> referring to &lsquo;silk,&rsquo; and that
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; is a misprint for <hi rend="italic">coverture;</hi> so
              that the meaning is, &lsquo;when <hi rend="italic">steel</hi> grows soft as <hi
                rend="italic">silk,</hi> let armors be made of <hi rend="italic">silk</hi> instead
              of <hi rend="italic">steel.</hi>&rsquo; We keep to the metrical arrangement of the
              original, and adopt the pointing of Knight, as we also do the changes of
              &lsquo;When&rsquo; into <hi rend="italic">Where</hi> and of
              &lsquo;him&rsquo; into <hi rend="italic">them, where</hi> being a relative
              adverb referring to &lsquo;courts and cities&rsquo; and <hi rend="italic"
              >them</hi> referring to &lsquo;instruments.&rsquo; Everyone experienced in
              proof-reading knows how apt <hi rend="italic">where</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
              >when</hi> and <hi rend="italic">him</hi> and <hi rend="italic">them</hi> are to be
              mistaken for each other, so that the changes in this case need not be greatly
              scrupled. Touching the whole passage as here given, we may observe that Marcius is
              referring to the &lsquo;long flourish&rsquo; which has just been made by the
              musical instruments in honour of his stout and valiant action. This he regards as a
              profanation; a using of that which was meant as an incitement to do, for the purpose
              of glorifying what has been done. And he wishes not simply, as it is in the common
              reading, that those instruments may never sound more, but that they may never sound
              more when thus abused to the end of sounding compliments and flatteries on the
              battlefield. All such &lsquo;fale-fac'd soothing&rsquo; he would have confined
              to &lsquo;courts and cities,&rsquo; where steel itself is used for ornament,
              not for fighting. That Marcius, with his all-devouring passion for war, should speak
              of courts and cities as made up of false-faced soothing is quite characteristic; but,
              as he thinks they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> so already, he would not wish they might
                <hi rend="italic">become</hi> so when drums and trumpets leave prompting and turn to
              complimenting feats of arms.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">C. &amp; M. Cowden

              believe, to the drums and trumpets, but he has totally changed the punctuation of the
              speech and, thereby, its meaning. It was no doubt the distance of the demonstrative
              pronoun from its noun or nouns rather in this instance which led to Tyrwhitt's strange
              conjecture that when steel grew soft it was to be made a coverture for the

              the whole, it is better to emphasize &ldquo;steel&rdquo;
              here.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I think neither the one nor the
              other,&rsquo; says Elze, as regards this remark by Abbott; he prefers that a pause
              after &lsquo;soft&rsquo; should take the place of the unaccented
                syllable.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Whitelaw</hi> regulates these lines thus:
                <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;May these same instruments, which you profane,<lb/> Never
                sound more! when drums and trumpets shall<lb/> I' the field prove flatterers, let

              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>&lsquo;It is possible,&rsquo; remarks Whitelaw, &lsquo;the word
              &ldquo;overture&rdquo; (not used elsewhere by Shakespeare in the sense of <hi
                rend="italic">prelude</hi>) is corrupt; but failing any probable correction of it,
              the passage, as given above, may be explained thus: Let your drums and trumpets,
              profaned to vulgar uses of flattery, never sound more! If even <hi rend="italic"
              >they</hi> must learn to flatter, if the soldier in his coat of steel must ape the
              parasite in </p>
            <p>his silk, let truth vanish out of the earth, and courts and cities go their own way
              undisturbed, let your drums and trumpets, I say, henceforth be
                silent!&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Schmidt</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Coriolanus</hi>) rearranges these lines thus: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;May these
                same instruments, which you profane,<lb/> Never sound more! when drums and trumpets
                shall<lb/> I' th' field prove flatterers, let 'em be made<lb/> An overture for the
                wars no more, I say!<lb/> When steel grows soft as th' parasite's silk let
                courts<lb/> And cities be made all of false-faced soothing!&rsquo;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>He thus comments on the whole passage: &lsquo;If for no other reason the very
              meaning of <hi rend="italic">coverture</hi> would make this conjecture impossible,
              since it does not mean what decorates and clothes, but what hides and conceals. The
              somewhat drastic rearrangement of the text speaks for itself, since by no other
              arrangement can the lines be presented correctly accentuated and metrical. But the
              chief error which prevails in the line divisions of this passage in the Folio can be
              easily elucidated if we accept that in the MS. there was a parenthesis including two
              lines, 58, 59, which the compositor dropped out. &lsquo;Him&rsquo; in l. 59
              can be nothing more than a misprint, and <hi rend="italic">'em</hi> is the word which
              stands nearest to &lsquo;him&rsquo; in form and makes all plain. Although the
              word &lsquo;overture&rsquo; in the sense of <hi rend="italic">prelude</hi> is
              not so used by Shakespeare, why should it not have been known in a sense which it now
                has?&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi>: [The retention of
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; by Warburton and others in the sense of prelude] is
              open to the objection that no example of the word in this sense has been found in
              Shakespeare's time, and that Shakespeare uses it in an entirely different meaning. In
                <hi rend="italic">King Lear,</hi> III, vii, 89, it has the sense of <hi
                rend="italic">disclosure</hi> or <hi rend="italic">exposure,</hi> as in <hi
                rend="italic">Wint. Tale,</hi> II, i, 172. In <hi rend="italic">All's Well,</hi> IV,
              iii, 46, V, iii, 99, and in <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night,</hi> I, v, 225, it
              signifies <hi rend="italic">proposal, offer.</hi> The last-mentioned passage is quoted
              by Malone in defence of the reading &lsquo;overture&rsquo; here, but he
              evidently misunderstood it. When, therefore, he states that he found the word in the
              sense of <hi rend="italic">prelude</hi> or <hi rend="italic">preparation</hi> in Sir
              John Davies and Philemon Holland, without quoting any instance from either writer, we
              may be allowed to question his accuracy. On the other hand, <hi rend="italic"
                >coverture</hi> is a distinctly Shakespearian word. See <hi rend="italic">Much
              Ado,</hi> III, i, 30: &lsquo;Who even now Is couched in the woodbine
                coverture.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Rolfe</hi>: Of the various
              emendations and explanations of this passage, we adopt Knight's as, on the whole, the
              most satisfactory&mdash;or the least unsatisfactory. [In answer to the last part
              of the foregoing note by Wright Rolfe says: &lsquo;The sound of the trumpet as the
              signal for beginning the battle is virtually an <hi rend="italic">offer</hi> of
              battle. (As in the passage from <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night,</hi> I, v, 225:
              &lsquo;I bring no overture of war,&rsquo; quoted by Malone.) Of course, it is
              not at all necessary to suppose that &lsquo;overture&rsquo; is used in any
              technical sense; and to prevent misunderstanding it would be better to avoid the use
              of <hi rend="italic">prelude</hi> in paraphrasing the passage, and to give it as White
              does: &lsquo;Let drums and trumpets be used to usher in war,&rsquo; etc. That
              is really all that it means, and the expression seems to us thoroughly
              Shakespearian.&rsquo; Rolfe's conclusion as to the meaning of the lines is,
              however, dependent on Knight's reading <hi rend="italic">them,</hi> whereas the Folio
              text is &lsquo;him&rsquo; and can refer to the word
              &lsquo;Steel&rsquo; alone.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Henry
                Irving Sh.</hi>): The passage by its regular balance has the form of sense, but what
              the sense may be it is difficult to determine. By laying stress upon
              &lsquo;all&rsquo; in l. 57 the first clause </p>
            <p>gains a certain meaning: &lsquo;If flattery has reached the field of battle, we
              must expect courts and cities to be entirely given over to it.&rsquo; But the
              second clause eludes interpretation. &lsquo;Overture&rsquo; in Shakespeare
              means either <hi rend="italic">disclosure</hi> or <hi rend="italic">proposal,</hi> and
              neither of these significations is appropriate to the parasite. The best emendation of
              the passage is Tyrwhitt's conjecture, <hi rend="italic">coverture,</hi> altering
              &lsquo;him&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">this,</hi> or, as Steevens suggested,
              leaving &lsquo;him&rsquo; unaltered in the sense of <hi rend="italic">it.
              His</hi> for the neuter possessive was common, as <hi rend="italic">its</hi> was only
              coming into use; <hi rend="italic">him</hi> for <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is another
              matter. [Beeching follows Dyce's arrangement of the text.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Perring</hi> (p. 296)
              quotes the five passages, besides the present one, wherein
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; appears, remarking that in all but one, <hi
                rend="italic">King Lear,</hi> III, vii, 89, &lsquo;the word means an offering of
              terms&mdash;whether hostile or amicable depends upon the context.&rsquo; It
              is, therefore, reasonable to suppose that that is its meaning here. Perring thus
              personifies &lsquo;Overture&rsquo; with the <hi rend="italic">ambassador</hi>
              who bears terms either of war or peace; when such a body, as Coriolanus
              describes&mdash;a man of silk and not of steel&mdash; was put forward the
              warlike sense was out of the question. &lsquo;There is no more reason,&rsquo;
              concludes Perring, &lsquo;why a man should not be said to be <hi rend="italic"
                >made</hi> an <hi rend="italic">overture</hi> than a man is said to be <hi
                rend="italic">made</hi> a sword, only the former is applied to the coward, the
              latter (as we have just seen) to Coriolanus. It is far too great a liberty to take
              with the text to change &ldquo;overture&rdquo; to <hi rend="italic"
                >coverture.</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Herwegh</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> ap. <hi rend="smallcap">Ulrici</hi>, p. 161): I have
              translated this passage according to the punctuation commonly accepted, namely,
              exclamation marks or a colon after &lsquo;never sound more,&rsquo; and a comma
              after &lsquo;flatterers,&rsquo; but I am not unmindful that the connection
              between &lsquo;when drums&rsquo; and &lsquo;let courts&rsquo; remains
              somewhat obscure. The meaning seems to me perchance this: When drums and trumpets turn
              into flatterers in the field, why should we reprehend courts and cities if they become
              made of nothing but false flattery. And then comes a parallel sentence with a second
              &lsquo;if&rsquo; and a second &lsquo;thus.&rsquo; My poetic sense does
              not permit me to disturb the versification here. Others have so done and have left the
              first &lsquo;let&rsquo; in disagreement with the first
              &lsquo;when.&rsquo; By the unconnected position of &lsquo;let
              courts&rsquo; we certainly gain in clarity what we lose in harmony. The incomplete
              verse (l. 57) does not justify us in regarding it as a corruption of the text, whereon
              the English editors lay such rash hands, whenever a verse of two, three, or four feet
              appears instead of a regular verse of five feet. On the contrary, I reckon these
              incomplete verses among the beauties of the Shakespearian versification, comparable to
              the pauses in music, and have taken pains in my translation as few times as possible
              to lengthen them out to their five feet. They are frequently used by Shakespeare with
              a very fine calculation, and his example should generally be followed.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Falcon Sh.</hi>): The first clause
              of this difficult speech gains a certain sense by laying stress on &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">all.</hi>&rsquo; &lsquo;If flattery has reached the field of
              battle, we must expect courts and cities to be entirely given over to
                it.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">E. K. Chambers</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Warwick Sh.</hi>): This is the most difficult passage in the play. Warburton
              proposed to read &lsquo;let camps <hi rend="italic">as</hi> cities,&rsquo; on
              the ground that cities being already corrupt, do not need the example of camps to
              become so. Shakespeare's point, however, is: &lsquo;If camps become flatterers,
              then let us not be surprised that courts and cities are altogether given up to
              flattery.&rsquo; The real crux lies in l. 59. &lsquo;Overture&rsquo; can
              only mean here a <hi rend="italic">proposal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">offer</hi> of
              war, as in <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night,</hi> I, v, 225; and how then can either
              &lsquo;steel&rsquo; or &lsquo;a parasite&rsquo; or
              &lsquo;silk&rsquo; be an &lsquo;overture&rsquo;? It seems to me
              impossible to maintain &lsquo;overture&rsquo;; I have, therefore, adopted
              Tyrwhitt's conjecture, <hi rend="italic">coverture,</hi> referring </p>
            <p>it to &lsquo;steel.&rsquo; I have also slightly rearranged the lines so as to
              bring &lsquo;no more I say&rsquo; into the first instead of the second period
              of the speech. This avoids two unmotived short lines in 57 and 64. It also makes
              Coriolanus's wish about the steel parallel to his wish about the instruments,
              &lsquo;Let these degenerate instruments and this degenerate steel be used for war
              no more.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Cholmeley</hi>: If the soldier's
              instruments can flatter, courts and cities may well be made of flattery; and if armor
              is to imitate silk, we may as well take silk for armor&mdash;<hi rend="italic">i.
                e.,</hi> the distinction between soldier and courtier is at an end.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's Sh.</hi>): Whether
              &lsquo;him,&rsquo; l. 59, be referred to &lsquo;steel&rsquo; or
              &lsquo;parasite&rsquo; or &lsquo;silk,&rsquo; I do not see that
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; can be so interpreted as to suit at once this and any
              of the other passages in which it occurs. Shakespeare uses it in two senses. <hi
                rend="italic">Disclosure</hi> is not a possible sense here, nor is the other, viz.,
                <hi rend="italic">offer, proposal.</hi> [Verity here quotes the five other passages
              outside of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> in which the word
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; occurs in Shakespeare.] Hence to interpret it here
              equivalent to <hi rend="italic">prelude</hi> (a musical metaphor), or <hi
                rend="italic">preparation for,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sign of</hi> is to give it
              a sense unknown elsewhere in Shakespeare. I see no escape, therefore, from the
              emendation <hi rend="italic">coverture;</hi> not that it is <hi rend="italic">per
              se</hi> an ideal word for the context, since it means <hi rend="italic">cover,
              shelter</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">covering</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Much
                Ado,</hi> III, i, 30, and <hi rend="italic">3 Henry VI:</hi> IV, ii, 13 (the two
              passages in which it is used). It could, however, be used in the sense <hi
                rend="italic">cover, covering,</hi> e. g., of clothes. Thus the coverings of leaves
              made by Adam and Eve are called &lsquo;vain covertures&rsquo; in <hi
                rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> x, 337.&mdash;Miss <hi rend="smallcap">C.
                Porter</hi> (<hi rend="italic">First Folio Sh.</hi>): It seems to us that Staunton
              is justified by the context in referring &lsquo;overture&rsquo; to the
              &lsquo;parasite&rsquo; instead of to &lsquo;silk,&rsquo; supposing
              also that &lsquo;him&rsquo; is used as frequently in early writings instead of
              the neuter <hi rend="italic">it.</hi> But we do not feel that the right sense of
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; has been found. We suspect the meaning is very simple,
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; being used merely in its etymological sense of <hi
                rend="italic">opening</hi> akin to that in <hi rend="italic">All's Well,</hi> V,
              iii, 16, &lsquo;she had made the overture.&rsquo; The complexity and hence the
              difficulty consists in the figurative idea attaching to the use of the word here in
              this simple sense. Marcius was thinking not of anything in the least abstract, but of
              an embodied opening, or overture for war, such an opening as he himself had just been
              in broaching the way of battle into Corioli; and again in constituting himself an
              opening or overture for the war against the foe in the field when he had desired, as
              Shakespeare puts it, to be made into a sword opening the way into the Volscian forces.
              As Plutarch says: &lsquo;he made a lane through them and opened a passage into the
              battell of the enemies.&rsquo; Now he is being praised for all this, and while
              really knowing more than anyone how essential the service was, he deprecates such
              praise of it as would tend to make any less hardihood in men than such deeds require.
              That is why he is so fierce about it. He loves valor and would have it a matter of
              course, not exceptional, to be made a fuss over. He is sensitively apprehensive of any
              softening by praise of the mettle war needs. Therefore he cuts the clamor short. May
              these war-trumpets, which you profane by sounding in praise of what is merely as it
              ought to be, sound not a tone more. When war-trumpets and battle-drums flatter on the
              battlefield (instead of being used for their legitimate purpose to incite to deeds
              there) let there be nothing in Courts and Cities but &lsquo;false-fac'd
              soothing.&rsquo; When Steele grows soft as the silk of the parasite, <hi
                rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">dependent upon other men,</hi> who
              does not stand alone and take the initiative, then let him be the one, and open out a
              path for warfare to follow in, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> &lsquo;an Overture
              for the Warres.&rsquo; He ends thus in proud, grim irony of the inadequacy for
              such an office, </p>
            <p>of any who does not stand alone, sufficient in himself and in his deed, which is done
              for the deed's sake, and beyond praise.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Sherman</hi>
                (<hi rend="italic">Tudor Sh.</hi>): Coriolanus with characteristic dislike of
              popular applause wishes martial instruments confined strictly to martial uses. If
              drums and trumpets, of which we expect stern sincerity, are prostituted to flattery,
              then let courts and cities, of which we ordinarily expect less candor, give themselves
              over wholly to hypocrisy. When the adulation of the city parasite is imitated upon the
              field of battle, then soldiers have ceased to be themselves, and may as well wear his
              silk as their steel. [In thus interpreting the last clause Sherman, it will be
              observed, adopts Tyrwhitt's emendation.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap"
                >Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Deighton</hi>: May these instruments, which
              you profane by using them for the purpose of proclaiming my triumphs (not for the
              purpose for which they were intended, that of giving the signal for the onset in
              battle), never be allowed to sound again! When drums and trumpets shall be employed in
              war for the purpose of flattery, we may well expect that courts and cities should wear
              one face of hypocritical cajolery (be made up of hypocrisy and nothing else)! When
              steel grows soft as the silken garments of the fawning hangers-on of rich men, let it
                (<hi rend="italic">him,</hi> the silk) be used as a protection in battle! . . . Even
              if &lsquo;overture&rsquo; were used in the modern sense [a <hi rend="italic"
                >prelude</hi>], it would have but little force here. Marcius's meaning clearly is,
              let things be turned to a use they never as yet had; whereas for drums and trumpets to
              be used as a prelude to a fight would be for them to be used as they ordinarily were.
              [There seems to be some confusion here; it is the softened
              &lsquo;steel,&rsquo; not the &lsquo;instruments,&rsquo; which is to be
              made an &lsquo;overture.&rsquo; &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]
              Against <hi rend="italic">a coverture</hi> there are two objections. In the first
              place, it is very unlikely that <hi rend="italic">a coverture</hi> should be altered
              to &lsquo;an Overture&rsquo; (with a capital <hi rend="italic">O</hi>); and
              secondly, though Shakespeare twice uses <hi rend="italic">coverture,</hi> the word in
              both instances means a cover that conceals, not a cover that protects, the meaning
              here required. I have therefore ventured in the place of
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; to read <hi rend="italic">armature,</hi> a word in use
              (though uncommon) in Shakespeare's time, both literally and figuratively, <hi
                rend="italic">e. g.,</hi> Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Pathway of Prayer,</hi> 1542,
              &lsquo;Prayer is truly called a . . . heavenly armature&rsquo;; Guillim, <hi
                rend="italic">Heraldrie,</hi> 1611: &lsquo;For by Armature we understand not
              only those things that appertaine to the Military profession but also those defensive
              sciences of Masonry and Carpentry and Metall work&rsquo; (quotations ap. Murray,
                <hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi>). I have also for the sake of the rhythm inserted
                <hi rend="italic">is</hi> after &lsquo;as&rsquo; in l. 58, [see <hi
                rend="italic">Text. Notes, ad loc.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]. To
              make the contrast really forcible we need instead of &lsquo;made&rsquo; some
              such word as <hi rend="italic">cleans'd, purg'd, free'd, stripp'd;</hi> and it is
              improbable that Shakespeare would have written &lsquo;Let him be made&rsquo;
              so immediately after &lsquo;Let courts be made.&rsquo; Webster, however, uses
                <hi rend="italic">coverture</hi> almost as = dress, &lsquo;Instead of gowns my
              coverture be earth,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">History of Sir Thomas Wyat,</hi> ed.
              Dyce, p. 203.&mdash;J. D. (<hi rend="italic">N. &amp; Q.,</hi> 30 April, 1881,
              p. 345): There does not seem to be any good reason for the alterations [made by
              Tyrwhitt and by Knight in this passage]. Coriolanus is speaking scornfully, implying
              that what he assumes is an impossibility, or something too absurd to be considered by
              reasonable men. He declaims against any future wars on account of the ingratitude of
              the Roman people, and wishes that the sword may only be drawn as the beginning of a
              war when it has become &lsquo;soft as a parasite's silk,&rsquo; <hi
                rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> never, &lsquo;ad Gr&aelig;cas calendas.&rsquo;
              [It is, I think, to be regretted that J. D. had not made himself acquainted with the
              present situation before attempting an elucidation of the text; had he but done so he
              would have seen that Marcius has not yet experienced ingratitude on the part </p>
            <p>of the Roman people, but is here reprehending the hyperbolical praise of the
                soldiers.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi> He thus continues:] &lsquo;It
              is objected to this explanation (1) that Shakespeare uses this in the sense of <hi
                rend="italic">disclosing,</hi> not of beginning or prelude; and (2) that there is no
              instance of the word being used in this latter sense so early as the time of
              Shakespeare. But the word, I need hardly say, means <hi rend="italic">opening,</hi>
              and this bears the double sense of <hi rend="italic">beginning,</hi> as in the <hi
                rend="italic">opening</hi> of a play, and also of making known. Cotgrave has:
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Ouverture:</hi> an overture or opening, beginning made,
              path begun or beaten unto; also manifestation, discovery, uncovering.&rsquo; In
              Bullokar's <hi rend="italic">Dict.</hi> (1616) the word appears in this sense,
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Overture,</hi> an opening entrance or way made unto; a
              motion or offer made.&rsquo; [See note by Malone, <hi rend="italic">ante.</hi>
              This definition does not appear either in the ed. 1616 or 1621.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] The word, then, might be used by Shakespeare in any of
              these meanings, and this sense of opening or prelude is the only one that can give a
              reasonable explanation of the passage. . . . The preceding part of the passage is in
              the same strain. Drums and trumpets do not flatter on the field of battle; they call
              to stern duty; but when they do flatter, then courts and cities may well be made <hi
                rend="italic">a portion</hi> &lsquo;of false-faced
                soothing.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Orger</hi> (p. 60):
              &lsquo;Overture&rsquo; is so naturally connected with war that the error lies
              much more probably in &lsquo;him,&rsquo; which may very likely be a mistake
              for some word indicative of the behaviour of the parasite as distinguished from the
              warrior. &lsquo;Smiles&rsquo; are the mark of the courtier, as in <hi
                rend="italic">Love's Labour's,</hi> V, ii, 331: &lsquo;This is the flower that
              smiles on every one.&rsquo; I would accordingly suggest with diffidence:
              &lsquo;Let <hi rend="italic">smiles</hi> be made an overture for the
                wars.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">G. Joicey</hi> (<hi rend="italic">N.
                &amp; Q.,</hi> 28 Nov., 1891, p. 423): In l. 57 if &lsquo;Made
              all&rsquo; were changed to <hi rend="italic">made well,</hi> and the words were
              understood to mean <hi rend="italic">healed</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cured,</hi> the
              sentence would very well express the soldier's idea that courts and cities corrupt
              men. In the second clause the confusion may have arisen through the compositor or
              transcriber mistaking the words <hi rend="italic">wear</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                >coverture</hi> for &lsquo;wars&rsquo; and &lsquo;overture,&rsquo;
              and then other changes may have been made in an attempt to rectify the passage. How
              would it do to read somewhat as follows: &lsquo;When steel grows soft as the
              parasite's silk Let <hi rend="italic">it</hi> be made <hi rend="italic">a
              coverture</hi> for <hi rend="italic">his wear!</hi>&rsquo; This reading, although
              it takes great liberty with the text, and is open to objection, would give a proper
              antithesis: War having turned flatterer, let courts and cities cast off their
              false-faced soothing, and steel having grown soft as silk, let it be spun into
              clothing for parasites to wear. The word <hi rend="italic">coverture</hi> is most like
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; or the last line might read &lsquo;into <hi
                rend="italic">vesture</hi> for his wear.&rsquo; The spirit of the speech would
              tend to cause <hi rend="italic">wear</hi> to be read
                &lsquo;wars.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">H. Ingleby</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">N. &amp; Q.,</hi> 6 Feb., 1892, p. 103), unaware apparently that
              he was anticipated, proposes to arrange and point these lines identically as they
              appear in Dyce, ed. ii.; he, however, retains the Folio reading
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; where Dyce follows Tyrwhitt. Ingleby thus paraphrases:
              &lsquo;Away with these instruments, which you profane! When war-like instruments
              prove flatterers, then shall our courts and cities be all composed of flatterers too!
              and when our steel becomes as soft as the flatterer's silk, then send him (the
              flatterer) to deliver our messages of war! Let us have no more of these instruments
              (which are unsuitable to us)!&rsquo; In sober prose we should have expected
              &lsquo;When our drums prove flatterers, then will our courts,&rsquo;
              &amp;c. But in declamatory verse expressive of indignation the imperative is much
              more effective though less grammatically accurate. It has generally been objected that
              a soldier would always describe courts and cities as &ldquo;made of false-faced
              soothing.&rdquo; But surely not a citizen of Rome! &ldquo;Him&rdquo; is
              usually </p>
            <p>changed to <hi rend="italic">them,</hi> as if the speaker would wish the very things
              he is rejecting to be again used! Or else it is changed to <hi rend="italic">it,</hi>
              which is not much better.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">R. M. Spence</hi>
                (<hi rend="italic">N. &amp; Q.,</hi> 6 Feb., 1892, p. 104): With no change save

              &lsquo;instruments&rsquo;) for &lsquo;him&rsquo; in l. 59, I retain
              the reading in the Folio, [Spence places a full stop after
              &lsquo;flatterers,&rsquo; after &lsquo;silk,&rsquo; and after
              &lsquo;wars,&rsquo; with an exclamation point after &lsquo;I
              say&rsquo;] presenting it thus: &lsquo;May I never more hear trumpet or drum
              if you are to profane them thus. Flattery may well dominate courts and cities when
              steel-clad warriors thus act like silken parasites. Keep these instruments for their
              proper use, to sound the battle charge. No more of this fulsome adulation!&rsquo;
              [In <hi rend="italic">N. &amp; Q.</hi> for 3 June, 1899, seven years later than
              the foregoing note, Spence proposes &lsquo;further emendations of the original
              text,&rsquo; viz.: <hi rend="italic">them</hi> for &lsquo;him,&rsquo;
              which he now refers to &lsquo;silk&rsquo; and therefore proposes that this be
              changed to <hi rend="italic">silks.</hi> The patient reader who has journeyed thus far
              through this long note will be aware, as Spence was not, that in both these
              conjectures the proposer had long since been anticipated.&mdash;<hi

              &lsquo;him&rsquo; is regarded as the dative instead of the objective case the
              difficulty in this much-discussed line will, I think, disappear. What would be then
              expressed would be: &lsquo;Let an overture for the wars be made to him,&rsquo;
              meaning, &lsquo;Let a proposal be made to the parasite with a view to engaging his
              services for the wars. The bribes and flatteries you offer will be congenial to him,
              and when steel has become soft as the silk he wears, he will make your best
              soldier.&rsquo; The words are spoken with infinite scorn, and no doubt contain, in
              addition, a suggestion that the Romans would like to have a general who would flatter
              them to their hearts' content, as a parasite flatters his patron. The word
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; is peculiarly appropriate in connexion with bribes and
              flattery. Coriolanus has just refused what he regards as a bribe to pay his sword,
              and, in the lines which immediately precede, has pictured a world whose ruling
              principle was flattery. &lsquo;Overture&rsquo; would thus appear to be far
              more in keeping with the spirit of the context than <hi rend="italic">coverture,</hi>
              which has generally supplanted it, while <hi rend="italic">armature</hi> owes its
              introduction merely to the manifest deficiency of <hi rend="italic">coverture.</hi>
              Besides, when steel has become soft as silk what need of either <hi rend="italic"

                >covering</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dress,</hi> so that Coriolanus may be supposed
              to be ironical: &lsquo;When steel grows as soft as the parasite's silk, then let

              &lsquo;the parasite&rsquo; and as a dative. Staunton alone, if I am not
              mistaken, has done so [see note by Thiselton, <hi rend="italic"
                >ante.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>], but he rashly thought that
              &lsquo;overture&rsquo; was a misprint for <hi rend="italic">ovation,</hi> or
              had that sense. . . . Had l. 59 run &lsquo;Let him be made an offer,&rsquo;
              etc., the sense would have been unmistakable; and as it stands, it seems to me
              (whether the line be correct or a misprint, and whatever its artistic demerits as an
              expression of thought) to admit readily of the following meaning: Let him (the
              parasite) be made a proposal for the wars. The thought of the passage in this case is:
              When your drums and trumpets flatter, when the soldier's garb is accommodated to the
              soft limbs of the parasite, why not complete the round and get the man to match? . . .
              If <hi rend="italic">coverture</hi> is read instead of &lsquo;overture,&rsquo;
              the only proposal commanding attention is that which refers it to silk or steel soft
              as silk, <hi rend="italic">without further alteration. Coverture</hi> has not </p>
            <p>been found = armor, but it is used for clothes and comes pretty near the sense of
              protective covering in Nashe, <hi rend="italic">Summer's Last Will</hi> (Haz.-Dods.,
              viii, 77), cited by an anonymous MS. annotator of Deighton's ed. of <hi rend="italic"
                >Coriolanus:</hi> &lsquo;Will'd that his body spoiled of coverture Should be
              cast furth into the open fields.&rsquo; The objection is that it necessitates
              imputing to Shakespeare a lax use of &lsquo;him&rsquo; for <hi rend="italic"
                >it</hi> (accusative), which he has not elsewhere employed, in a passage where it
              especially leads to ambiguity. In the only illustration actually offered from other
              writers there can be no doubt of the meaning, and the use otherwise fits in more
              naturally with the thought. See (as quoted by Wright, <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>)
              Bacon, <hi rend="italic">Advancement of Learning,</hi> ii, 22, &sect; 11.
              Obviously <hi rend="italic">coverture</hi> could be read with dative <hi rend="italic"
                >him</hi> referring to the parasite, but <hi rend="italic">coverture</hi> has not
              the claims of a Folio reading.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Tucker Brooke</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Yale Sh.</hi>) retains the Folio reading,
              &lsquo;overture,&rsquo; since he considers that Tyrwhitt's alteration does not
              much assist the interpretation of l. 59. His own interpretation is substantially the
              same as Staunton's, that &lsquo;him&rsquo; is in the dative, not the objective
              case, and thus refers to the parasite. &lsquo;When soldiers adopt the effeminate
              ways of courtiers let us recruit our armies among the latter class.&rsquo; </p>

              <hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 491): Sometimes in the survival [of a passage
              in North] the fact is transformed to figure, the prose to poetry. After Marcius's
              miracles of valour at Corioli Cominius gives him, &lsquo;in </p>
            <p>testimonie that he had wonne that day the price of prowes above all other, a goodly
              horse with a capparison, and all furniture to him.&rsquo; This Shakespeare does
              not omit. [The present lines quoted.] But the same episode furnishes Titus Lartius
              with his imagery as he points to the wounded and victorious hero, &lsquo;O general
              Here is the steed, we the caparison,&rsquo; ll. 17, 18. This illustrates the sort
              of sea-change that always takes place in the language of North under the hands of the
              magician, though it may not always be equally perceptible. But it is never entirely
              lacking even where we are at first more struck by the amount that Shakespeare has
              retained without alteration. </p>

              remarks: &lsquo;But even supposing this to be allowed, there will remain the
              further difficulty that in the narrative of Plutarch, from which the incident is
              taken, the host of Coriolanus is described not as a &ldquo;poor&rdquo; but a
              &ldquo;rich&rdquo; man. I have therefore ventured to interpolate <hi
                rend="italic">rich,</hi> and to read &ldquo;a poor-richman's,&rdquo; <hi
                rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> one who had been <hi rend="italic">rich,</hi> but had now
              become &ldquo;poor&rdquo; and wretched as a prisoner. Or, if preferred, the
              reading might be, &ldquo;at a rich man's house now poor.&rdquo; Coriolanus
              calls him, below, &ldquo;my poor host.&rdquo; Shakespeare has the words
              &ldquo;poor-rich&rdquo; combined (not hyphened in old ed.), with the meaning
                <hi rend="italic">seemingly rich, but indeed poor,</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                >Lucrece,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>140; and again, <hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 97, &ldquo;poorly rich.&rdquo;
              It is strange that no editor, so far as I have seen, has noticed the discrepancy
              between Shakespeare and his authority, Plutarch, in the description of the Coriolan
                host.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 581): The
              postponement of pity to wrath is a new characteristic detail which shows how these
              gentler impulses in Coriolanus must yield to his ruling passions. On the other hand,
              his host is transformed from a rich to a poor man, and thus his humanity acquires a
              wider range, and we see how it can extend beyond his own class if only there is a
              personal claim on it. Above all, there is the new illuminating touch of the lapse of
              memory. Sometimes this has been taken as betraying the indifference of the aristocrat
              for an inferior whose name he does not think it worth while to remember. Surely not.
              Coriolanus is experiencing the collapse that follows his superhuman exertions, the
              exhaustion of body and mind when one cannot think of the most familiar words, but he
              rallies his strength for a last effort, and is just able to intercede for his humble
              guest-friend ere he succumbs.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Prolss</hi> (p. 102):
              Plutarch, by making the host of Coriolanus a rich man, directly bases the leader's
              request upon the contrast between the former wealth and the present pitiable condition
              of his host. Shakespeare by making Marcius forget the name of his host seeks not only
              to exalt the purity of the pity and complete lack of selfseeking in the gratitude of
              his hero but also that he knows how to value good qualities even in a poor
                man.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's
              Sh.</hi>): Shakespeare's variation of the man's status [as given by Plutarch] tells in
              two ways: by heightening our admiration of the hero who, at such a moment, remembers
              his humble befriender, and by emphasizing the aristocratic, exclusive temper to which
              the name of a mere man of the people had been of no account.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Case</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>): Some critics believe
              that Shakespeare's purpose in inventing the circumstance of Coriolanus's <hi
                rend="italic">forgetfulness</hi> is to represent him as being so selfish that he
              does not care to take the trouble to remember the name of his poor host and makes his
              request &lsquo;entirely out of a sense of what his own magnanimity requires of
              him&rsquo; (Deighton, [MS.]). </p>
            <p>There can, I think, be no doubt that this, or the like, is too ingenious a gloss on
              one of Shakespeare's natural touches, the amnesia of an exhausted man, which the wine
              he asks for probably disperses. His nature can answer the bravery of the volunteers in
              scene vi. with comradeship and respect, and was equally capable of forgetting its
              pride in answer to kindness accepted from a poor man.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Beeching</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Falcon Sh.</hi>): Notice how Shakespeare has used
              this episode to emphasize the generosity of Marcius and its futility because self had

              peculiar verbal deliberateness in the &lsquo;irony.&rsquo; What Aufidius says
              in ll. 27-30 is the precise antithesis of what he afterwards does (IV, v.), though in
              the end (V, vi.) he swings back to his first purpose. We have seen (I, iv, 57, I, vi,
              89) the &lsquo;ironical&rsquo; method applied similarly to Aufidius's great
              rival, hence a parallelism of design and development in the story. </p>

              &lsquo;The Seine is seen,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The lane is lone,&rsquo; or
              &lsquo;The main doth moan,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The sullen tarn awaked her

              of the Folio's vagaries. It is hardly too much to say that, if the various phenomena

                rend="smallcap">Coleridge</hi>, in his Notes on this play, commenting on this and
              the next speech of Aufidius, says: &lsquo;I have such deep faith in Shakespeare's
              heart-lore that I take for granted that this is in nature, and not as a mere anomaly;
              although I cannot in myself discover any germ of possible feeling which could wax and
              unfold itself into such sentiment as this. However, I perceive that in this speech is
              meant to be contained a prevention of shock at the after-change in Aufidius's
                character.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verplanck</hi>: Such a criticism
              from Coleridge is worthy the reader's consideration, but I cannot myself perceive its
              justice. The varying feelings of Aufidius are such as may be often observed to arise
              in the contentions of able and ambitious men for honour or power, and are just such as
              would, under these circumstances, be natural in a mind like that of
              Aufidius&mdash;ambitious, proud, and bold, with many noble and generous qualities,
              yet not above the influence of selfish and vindictive emotions and desires. The
              mortification of defeat embitters his rivalry to hatred. When afterwards his banished
              rival appeals to his nobler nature, that hatred dies away and his generous feeling
              revives. Bitter jealousy and hatred again grow up as his glories are eclipsed by his
              former adversary; yet this dark passion too finally yields to a generous sorrow at his
              rival's death. I think that I have observed very similar alternations of such mixed
              motives and sentiments in eminent men in the collisions of political
                life.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sh's Life,
              Art,</hi> etc., ii, 487), after quoting in part the foregoing remark by Coleridge,
              says: &lsquo;The speech is hard indeed; but I do not take it as a fair index of
              the speaker's real mind; it seems to me but one of those ebullitions of rage in which
              men's hearts are not so bad as their tongues; the impulsive extravagance of a very
              ambitious and inconstant nature writhing in an agony of disappointment. In such cases
              dark thoughts often bubble up from unseen depths in the mind, yet do not crystallize
              into character. Still it must be owned that Aufidius comes pretty near putting the
              thought of the speech into act at last.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >MacCallum</hi> (p. 586): It seems strange that Coleridge should say this, for it is
              proved by not a few examples that baffled emulation may issue in an envy which knows
              few restraints. Peril was the avowal rather than the temper which struck him as
              verging on the unnatural or abnormal. Those who </p>
            <p>deliberately adopt such an attitude do not usually admit it to themselves, still less
              to their victims, and least of all to a third party, which may admonish us that
              Aufidius's threats were not deliberate, but mere frantic outcries wrung from him in
              rage and mortification. Yet they spring from authentic impulses in his heart, and
              though they may for a time be hidden by his superficial chivalry, yet they will spread
              and thrive if the conditions favour their growth. When they have over-run his nature
              and choked the wholesome grain, he will not point to them so openly and will name them
              by other names. But they are the same and differ from what they were only as the
              thorny thicket differs from its parent seeds. They have always been there, and it is
              well that we should be aware of their presence from the first. . . . In short, it is
              not to be taken as his definite program from which he inconsistently deviates when the
              opportunity is offered at Antium for carrying it out, but as the involuntary
              presentment, which the revealing power of anguish awakens in his soul, of the crimes
              he is capable of committing for his master passion, a presentiment that in the end is
              realised almost to the letter.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">T. Page</hi>: We do not
              feel Coleridge's difficulty here; we regard the words, awful as they are, as scarcely
              to be taken seriously; they represent simply a temporary furious outburst of anger
              couched in the wildest language Aufidius can discover on the spur of the moment. </p>

              like the thing itself, was in frequent use, and, like other familiar terms, became
              shortened for convenience sake. In Sir Henry Ellis's Letter's Illustrative of English

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Warburton</hi>: The dramatic art of this speech is great. For
              after Aufidius had so generously received Coriolanus in exile, nothing but the memory
              of this speech, which lets one so well into Aufidius's nature, could make his after
              perfidy and baseness at all probable. But this line [l. 25] is corrupt. For tho',
              indeed, he might call the <hi rend="italic">assaulting</hi> Marcius at any of those
              sacred seasons and places an <hi rend="italic">embarkment</hi> of fury; yet he could
              not call the <hi rend="italic">seasons and places themselves,</hi> so. We may believe,
              therefore, that Shakespeare wrote: &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Embarrments</hi> all
              of fury,&rsquo; &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> obstacles. Tho' those
              seasons and places are all obstacles to my fury, yet &amp;c. The Oxford Editor
              [Hanmer] has, in his usual way, refined upon this emendation in order to make it his
              own; and so reads <hi rend="italic">Embankments,</hi> not considering how ill this
              metaphor agrees with what is said just after of their lifting up &lsquo;their
              rotten privilege&rsquo; which evidently refers to a wooden <hi rend="italic"
              >bar,</hi> not an earthen <hi rend="italic">bank.</hi> These two generals are drawn
              equally covetous of glory: But the Volscian not scrupulous about the means. And his
              immediate repentence, after the assassinate [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], well agrees
              with such a character.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Heath</hi> (p. 413): As <hi
                rend="italic">Embarrments</hi> is a word quite new from Mr Warburton's own coinage,
              from whence he hath so plentifully besprinkled our poet's works with terms of base
              alloy, I am not much inclined to accept it for current. The reading of the former
              editions was <hi rend="italic">embarkments.</hi> Why may not this word have the same
              meaning as <hi rend="italic">embargo,</hi> derived from the Spanish, <hi rend="italic"
                >embargar,</hi> to arrest, stop, or stay; whence also in the same language, <hi
                rend="italic">embaracion,</hi> an arresting or stopping? Or if the reader should
              think a new word should be coined for the occasion, why not as well <hi rend="italic"
                >embargments?</hi> Mr Warburton's cavil about the uniformity of the metaphor is mere
              trifling. For an <hi rend="italic">embarrment</hi> made with a wooden bar, as he
              chooses to have it, unless the said </p>
            <p>bar be supposed to lift up itself, can no more lift up a privilege than an embarkment
                can.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: The word in the old copy is spelt
              &lsquo;embarquements,&rsquo; and, as Cotgrave says, meant not only an <hi
                rend="italic">embarkation,</hi> but an <hi rend="italic">embargoing.</hi> The
              &lsquo;rotten privilege and custom&rsquo; that follow seem to favor this
              explanation, and therefore the old reading may well enough stand, as an <hi
                rend="italic">embargo</hi> is undoubtedly an <hi rend="italic"
                >impediment.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: In Sherwood's English
              and French Dictionary, at the end of Cotgrave's, we find: &lsquo;To imbark, to
              imbargue. <hi rend="italic">Embarquer.</hi>&rsquo; &lsquo;An imbarking, an
              imbarguing. <hi rend="italic">Embarquement.</hi>&rsquo; Cole, in his <hi

                >imbarque,</hi> or lay an <hi rend="italic">imbargo</hi> upon.&rsquo; There can
              be no doubt, therefore, that the old copy is right. If we derive the word from the
              Spanish, <hi rend="italic">embargar,</hi> perhaps we ought to write <hi rend="italic"
                >embargement;</hi> but Shakespeare's word certainly came to us from the French, and

              as an indication that in such cases of local colouring Shakespeare had probably London
              in his mind, that in the year 1588 the Mayor and Corporation of the City petitioned
              the Queen that they might build four corn mills on the river Thames near the Bridge,
              and the Masters of the Trinity House certified that the erection of these mills
              &lsquo;on the south side of the Thames upon the Starlings above the
              bridge&rsquo; would breed no annoyance. The &lsquo;city mills,&rsquo;

              <hi rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Falcon Sh.</hi>): The first part
              of this scene is an amusing study in manners. Notice the superior tone Menenius adopts
              towards the Tribunes, soon passing into downright rudeness, which they hardly resent,
              while he loses his temper at once when they in turn only hint at a home-truth. The
              entry of the ladies makes us forget plebeian Rome, and leads up to the triumph. The
              last part of the scene is a reminder that to ridicule or ignore the Tribunes is not to
              draw their sting.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Student's Sh.</hi>): The purpose of this prelude is to show that Coriolanus's
              brilliant exploits and services to his country have not affected the causes of
              dissension between the patricians and the people (represented by the Tribunes) nor the
              popular feeling of grievance against Coriolanus himself.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >E. K. Chambers</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Warwick Sh.</hi>): The subject of the first
              act was the nobility of Coriolanus; for all his faults he is lifted before our eyes to
              an heroic level. The subject of the second act is his inherent weakness, leading up to
              and explaining the tragic crisis of his fate in the third act. The first need for a
              would-be leader of men is a certain sympathy with average every-day humanity. Of this
              Coriolanus has nothing; he is too completely self-centered and self-absorbed. It is
              the function of the second act to bring this out, and to show how irreconcilable is
              the hostility between him and the plebeians. The crucial test of this is the
              canvassing for the consulship in which Coriolanus's insolent demeanor gives occasion
              to his enemies the Tribunes to destroy the momentary popularity which he has won by
              his valour.&mdash;Miss <hi rend="smallcap">C. Porter</hi> (<hi rend="italic">First

              following him across the stage, it may be that the Tribunes pass way out upon the
              projecting fore-stage, and, standing with their backs to the audience and at one side,
              at the back of the procession, come forward after it has passed out at the opposite

              before his eyes, and the other hanging down his back out of sight, and filled with his
              own faults. This is referred to by Horace (<hi rend="italic">Sat.</hi> II, iii, 299)
              and by Catullus (xxii, 21), who seems to speak of one wallet with two parts. Persius
              (iv, 24) slightly varies the image by giving every one a single wallet to hang behind

              for the wine, surrounding an inner chamber for hot coals. The wine was poured in at
              one side and drawn off by a cock at the lower opposite side. I give this note for what

              p. 351): Few scenes are worse printed in the early copies than this between Menenius
              and the two Tribunes: it is full of literal errors, and of some which are important to
              the author's sense, and are set right in manuscript in the Second Folio. What is
              &lsquo;the first complaint&rsquo; in connexion with Menenius's love for
              &lsquo;a cup of hot wine&rsquo;? It is merely an error from mishearing on the
              part of the copyist; for, undoubtedly, we ought to alter &lsquo;first&rsquo;

              >thirst</hi> complaint.&rsquo; The humour is entirely lost in the old misprinted

              instead of &lsquo;without,&rsquo; nothing could be easier than the misprint of
              one word for the other; seeing that <hi rend="italic">thirst complaint</hi> must be
              right, we can readily believe in the </p>
            <p>less important change.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Singer</hi> (<hi rend="italic"

              to <hi rend="italic">thirst</hi> is not necessary, for it seems that
              &lsquo;thirst&rsquo; was sometimes provincially pronounced and spelt <hi

              Menenius uses it jocularly.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Anon.</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Blackwood's Maga.,</hi> Sep., 1853, p. 321): No sense can be extracted
              from &lsquo;first complaint&rsquo; by any process of distillation. The old
              corrector, brightening up for an instant, writes &lsquo;<hi rend="italic"
              >thirst</hi> complaint,&rsquo; on which Mr Singer remarks [as in the foregoing
              note]. Come, come, Mr Singer, that is hardly fair. Let us give the devil his due. What
              one reader out of every million was to know that &lsquo;first&rsquo; was a
              provincialism for <hi rend="italic">thirst?</hi> We ourselves, at least, had not a
              suspicion of it till the old corrector opened our eyes to the right
              reading&mdash;the meaning of which is, &lsquo;I am said to have a failing in
              yielding rather too readily to the <hi rend="italic">thirst</hi> complaint.&rsquo;
              This emendation covers a multitude of sins, and ought, beyond a doubt, to be promoted
              into the text.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Delius</hi>: &lsquo;It is said of me,
              I am somewhat weak therein, that I favour the first complaint or charge, that I give
              judgment to the first plaintiff, without a further examination of the
              case.&rsquo;&mdash; This mode of procedure of Menenius with a client stands in
              direct opposition to the utterly tedious procedure in like cases with which he later
              reproaches the Tribunes.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi>: Mr Collier asks:
              &lsquo;What is &ldquo;the first complaint&rdquo; in connexion with
              Menenius's love for a cup of hot wine?&rsquo; But is it quite certain that any
              &lsquo;connexion&rsquo; was intended between &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">the
                first complaint</hi>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">a cup of hot
                wine</hi>&rsquo;<hi rend="italic">?</hi> At least if the Folio faithfully
              represents the author's punctuation, none was intended; for in the Folio we find a
              colon after &lsquo;Tiber in't,&rsquo; while &lsquo;the first
              complaint&rsquo; is disjoined only by a comma&mdash;&lsquo;hasty and
              tinder-like upon too trivial motion&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="italic">words which
                assuredly do not in any way allude to Menenius's love for drinking.</hi> Again, is
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">the</hi> thirst <hi rend="italic"
              >complaint</hi>&rsquo; a probable expression? In short, I consider the MS.
              Corrector's alteration a very doubtful one; and I have the satisfaction of knowing
              that Mr John Forster concurs with me in that opinion. I must add that Mr Singer's
              explanation of &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">first</hi>&rsquo; appears to me even
              more unlikely than the MS. Corrector's new reading, by which indeed it was evidently
              suggested.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Staunton</hi>: What is &lsquo;the first
              complaint&rsquo;? At one time we conceived the sprightly, warm-hearted old
              senator, among his other failings, &lsquo;cried out of women,&rsquo; and
              referred to what Ben Jonson as obscurely terms &lsquo;the primitive work of
              darkness&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">Devil is an Ass,</hi> II, ii.); but what
              militates against this supposition, and the wonderfully acute emendation of Collier's
              MS. Corrector also, is the doubt whether &lsquo;complaint&rsquo; obtained the
              sense <hi rend="italic">malady</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ailment</hi> until many years
              after these plays were written. If it did not bear this meaning in Shakespeare's day,
              the only explanation of &lsquo;something imperfect in favouring the first
              complaint&rsquo; appears to be that he was too apt to be led away by first
              impressions; to act rather from impulse than from reflection.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ingleby</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sh. Controversy,</hi> p. 144), in
              his chapter on Philological Tests as to the genuineness of the corrections in
              Collier's Folio, instances the foregoing objection by Staunton in regard to the
              modernity of &lsquo;complaint&rsquo; in a medical sense, remarking that the
              &lsquo;whole phrase would be nonsense&rsquo; unless
              &lsquo;complaint&rsquo; were there employed with that meaning. &lsquo;Now
              I think,&rsquo; adds Ingleby, &lsquo;the latter position indisputable; but I
              have not examined a sufficiently large number of instances to arrive at any decided
              opinion on the former point. However, it is not improbable that this test-word may
              ultimately be found to be of great value in the determination of the question of the
              genuineness of the </p>
            <p>manuscript notes of the disputed folio.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Leo</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> p. 121): If &lsquo;first
              complaint&rsquo; does not stand in connexion with the mysterious charms of the
              worship of Venus, I would suggest the following explanation: Menenius gives his own
              portrait as that of an Epicurean. He confesses to liking drinking and revelling, so
              that I wonder he does not say anything about eating. But perhaps he does; he does not
              at all favour &lsquo;the first complaint,&rsquo; for else he would favour the
              complaint of the Plebeians, and since he already in the first words has confessed to
              like drinking, the &lsquo;thirst&rsquo; has no reason to complain. That
              Menenius is known to be a gourmand appears from the remark of Brutus, &lsquo;you
              are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table&mdash;,&rsquo; and
              if we therefore take the <hi rend="italic">f</hi> in &lsquo;favouring&rsquo;
              as a misprint for long <hi rend="italic">&longs;,</hi> and remember that Menenius
              says, <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;but when we have stuff'd<lb rend="RIGHT"/> These pipes
                and these conveyances of our blood<lb/> With wine and feeding, we have suppler
                souls<lb/> Than in our priest-like fasts. . . .&rsquo; (V, i, 63-66),<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>we are induced to search in &lsquo;the first complaint&rsquo; for a misprint
              for something belonging to the culinary art; and the words &lsquo;priest-like
              fasts&rsquo; remind us of the time when fasting was ordered&mdash;the lenten
              time. Is it not possible that &lsquo;first complaint&rsquo; is a misprint for
                <hi rend="italic">feast of lent,</hi> and that instead of &lsquo;in favouring
              the first complaint&rsquo; we ought to read &lsquo;in favouring the <hi
                rend="italic">feast of lent.</hi>&rsquo; (I will not too strongly advocate a
              change in the word <hi rend="italic">feast,</hi> and reading <hi rend="italic"
              >fish</hi> for it. See <hi rend="italic">Pericles,</hi> II, ii, &lsquo;we'll have
              flesh for holidays, fish for fasting days.&rsquo;) At all events the sense given
              by the emendation is quite in keeping with the whole portrait: Menenius likes neither
              wine allayed with Tyber, nor lenten food, nor retiring to bed early&mdash; in
              short, he confesses to being a jolly fellow. [Leo prefaces his note with the modest
              disclaimer that he himself does not &lsquo;pretend to attach much importance to
              it&rsquo;; again some fifteen years later (<hi rend="italic">Jahrbuch,</hi> xv, p.
              55), in reference to his proposed emendation, he says: &lsquo;I gladly surrender
              it to the laughing critics of the editors, since I myself regarded it only as an
              attempt, a makeshift, but I really believe it was beneficial, either to specify
              formerly proposed emendations or to refer to them as needless and
              incorrect.&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Si sic omnes,</hi> etc.&mdash;<hi

              not set the latter word aside because Mr Singer has discovered that &lsquo;<hi

                >first</hi> and <hi rend="italic">furst.</hi>&rsquo; Shakespeare does not make

              All readers, too, according to my observation, refer &lsquo;said to be&rsquo;
              to &lsquo;allaying Tyber&rsquo;; but it is Menenius who, being
              &lsquo;hasty and tinderlike upon too trivial motion,&rsquo; is said to be
              &lsquo;something imperfect in favouring the first complaint&rsquo; brought to
              him. All the clauses of this sentence are but specifications of his traits of
              character.&mdash;A. A. (<hi rend="italic">Notes &amp; Queries,</hi> 19 March,
              1864, p. 231): It has been proposed to read the &lsquo;<hi rend="italic"
              >thirst</hi> complaint&rsquo;; but is not the passage better as it stands?
              Menenius says he has two faults, or complaints. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> that
              he is &lsquo;humorous&rsquo;; the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> that he is too
              fond of a cup of hot wine, and that this <hi rend="italic">second</hi> complaint has

            <p>such a phrase as &lsquo;the thirst <hi rend="italic">complaint</hi>&rsquo; in

              complaint made against him, while his being &lsquo;one that loves a cup of hot
              wine,&rsquo; &amp;c., is the second complaint made against him. He goes on to
              explain what is &lsquo;the first complaint&rsquo; by adding &lsquo;hasty
              and too tinder-like upon too trivial motion,&rsquo; which exactly interprets the

                rend="smallcap">Schmidt</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> p. 86) quotes at
              some length two interpretations of this passage: the first, that which is commonly
              accepted, viz., Menenius is too apt to give judgment in the case of an appeal without
              due deliberation; second, that some commentators have understood by &lsquo;the
              first complaint&rsquo; the sin of Adam and Eve, symbolised by the eating of the
              apple; Georg Herwegh, who edited this play for Ulrici's ed., is responsible for this;
              he has had no followers, but, as Schmidt objects, Menenius is represented as an old
              man, and besides he is not given to speaking so euphemistically. Schmidt is quite in
              agreement with those editors who hold that the text is here corrupt, but maintains
              that no emendation thus far proposed is acceptable (Leo's &lsquo;<hi rend="italic"
                >feast of lent</hi>&rsquo; he only refers to as &lsquo;a
              curiosity&rsquo;). In conclusion he offers his own solution of the difficulty,
              which as an original emendation is even more of &lsquo;a curiosity&rsquo; than
              Leo's; it is that we here read <hi rend="italic">thirst-complaint.</hi> No reference
              is made to the fact that this is the reading of Collier's MS. Corrector or that any
              other editor so reads following that correction. Schmidt na&iuml;vely explains
              that <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and <hi rend="italic">th</hi> are near allied in sound
              and that as the Tribunes speak of hunger Menenius confesses to a sympathy with the
              thirsty ones. This is, however, but one of many indications in Schmidt's notes to this
              play that he had not consulted&mdash;perhaps even did not know of&mdash;the
              MS. corrections in Collier's Folio.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Ed.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi>: That is, in hastily
              judging a case without waiting to hear the other side; not wasting time upon trifles
              like the Tribunes. It has been objected to this reading that Menenius would not speak
              of himself in such depreciatory terms, and justify the Tribunes&rsquo; attack. But
              it is his humour to say of himself the worst that popular opinion says of him, and so
              to disarm his opponents; that he is quick of temper and hasty of tongue, that his bark
              is worse than his bite, that he never stops to think whether his outspokenness will
              give offense. There appears to be no necessity for change, and certainly none for
              reading with Collier &lsquo;the thirst complaint&rsquo; or with Leo
              &lsquo;savouring the feast (or fish) of Lent.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi

              deliberate judgment. [The majority of modern editors is in favour of the view that
              Menenius admits that he is a little too prone to give judgment without considering the
              case sufficiently. Staunton's objection to &lsquo;complaint&rsquo; </p>

              but it also includes reference to a King of Thrace, named Lycurgus, who abolished the
              worship of Bacchus from his dominions, and ordered all the vines therein to be cut

              parenthesis is, I think, evidently demanded by the sense. Menenius is piquing himself
              on his frankness, and declares that he cannot call such politicians as these
              Lycurgusses on any occasion when he falls in with them. I think it clear we should

              After &lsquo;ass&rsquo; and <hi rend="italic">as</hi> in l. 60 it was easy to
              think of <hi rend="italic">ace. Ass</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ace</hi> were
              pronounced alike, and Shakespeare had been very guilty of the pun about twelve years

              suggested &lsquo;faces.&rsquo; &lsquo;Faces&rsquo; was a regular word
              for &lsquo;face-cards&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> king, queen,

              together. Compare Cotton's <hi rend="italic">Complete Gamester</hi> (1674):
              &lsquo;If you have neither ace nor face you may throw up your game&rsquo; (<hi
                rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi>). On this and the ordinary meaning of
              &lsquo;faces&rsquo; Menenius puns. You are worthy &lsquo;asses,&rsquo;
              he says, and speaking of &lsquo;aces,&rsquo; they are deadly liars that report
              you have good &lsquo;faces.&rsquo; This is not easy punning, but </p>
            <p>&lsquo;faces&rsquo; is pointless without it.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Case</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>): There are probably two senses here:
              (1) good faces, honest faces, the indices of good hearts, the denial of which destroys
              any credit not already ironically subtracted from &lsquo;reverend,
              grave&rsquo;; (2) handsome faces. This closes Menenius's speech so far as it
              relates to his own faults as they may appear to the two Tribunes: he loves strong
              wine; he is hasty; he revels late; he speaks his mind; he shows it too (here the list
              leaves what is generally known and becomes an attack on the Tribunes); he does not
              applaud their words, for he finds them foolish; if he must not contradict the titles
              that belong to age when others bestow them on them, he thinks their looks ugly in both
              senses. This they may see in him, as he goes on to tell them. &lsquo;I cannot
              grant the finality of Gordon's ingenious view that <hi rend="italic">ass</hi>
              suggested <hi rend="italic">ace,</hi> and that <hi rend="italic">ace</hi> suggested
              &ldquo;faces.&rdquo; It entirely ignores the intervening clause,
              &ldquo;and though . . . reverend, grave men,&rdquo; which sufficiently
              accounts for what follows, not to say that it is almost inevitable for Menenius to
              proceed from attack on character to attack on looks. It cannot be said, as Gordon
              does, that &ldquo;&lsquo;faces&rsquo; is pointless without&rdquo; the
              pun he suggests.&rsquo; [With this I quite agree; I may even go further and say
              that for philological reasons Gordon's deduced pun is inadmissible, since it depends
              entirely upon the sense in which &lsquo;faces&rsquo; is to be taken. His
              quotation from Cotton is too late (1674) to be acceptable as an example of
              Shakespearian usage. The name applied to &lsquo;face cards,&rsquo; according
              to <hi rend="smallcap">Murray</hi> (<hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi>), was
              &lsquo;coat, or cote cards&rsquo; (from the brightly coloured costumes of the

              occurs several times in Shakespeare. In his discourse on the virtues of sherris-sack

                rend="italic">Bisson,</hi> as follows: &lsquo;That is, blind. Skinner's
              explanation and etymology of this word are almost beneath notice, owing, I imagine, to
              his having too hastily taken it for granted that <hi rend="italic">bisson,</hi> in
              Shakespeare's time, did really signify positive blindness. It has long appeared to me
              that <hi rend="italic">bisson</hi> is fairly deducible from the Saxon verb, of which
              the literal import is <hi rend="italic">respicere;</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                >respicere,</hi> exactly translated, means <hi rend="italic">to look back upon.</hi>
              Shakespeare may be thought to have this idea in his mind when in a speech by the same
              personage, just before that in which <hi rend="italic">bisson</hi> occurs, he says:
              &ldquo;You talk of pride; oh, that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of
              your necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves.&rdquo; And it is
              still more probable that this idea, having taken possession of his mind, led him
              immediately after to use the word <hi rend="italic">bisson,</hi> which, I conceive, is
              its true sense, notwithstanding its having acquired, in process of time, a somewhat
              different one in provincial speech. <hi rend="italic">Bisson rheum</hi> it would be
              harsh, and forced beyond all precedent, to interpret into blindness occasioned by
              rheum or a defluxion; nor would it add much, if anything, to the sense and meaning of
              the passage, even if the context would admit of such an interpretation. The whole
              speech has, and was intended to have, an air of obscurity and mysteriousness, that it
              might with the more effect, as well as with greater safety, convey more than met the
              ear. The passage in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> in which we have the odd phrase
              of &ldquo;bisson conspectuities,&rdquo; is also, with the same view, dark and
              ambiguous, that its ironical severity might </p>
            <p>be the more poignant. &ldquo;Bisson conspectuities,&rdquo; as I would
              interpret it, means, and is equivalent to, indirect or distorted view, &amp;c. It
              is easy, if not natural, to regard distorted vision as imperfect; and an imperfect
              sight as blindness.&rsquo;&mdash;The unfortunate derivation by Skinner to
              which Boucher alludes is quoted in Nares, s. v. <hi rend="italic">Bisson</hi> as

              Jupiter <hi rend="italic">take his cap.</hi> Shakespeare's thought is very different
              from what his editors dreamed of. He wrote, Take my <hi rend="italic">cup,</hi>
              Jupiter, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> I will go offer a libation to thee for this
              good news, which was the custom of that time. There is a pleasantry, indeed, in his
              way of expressing it, very agreeable to his convivial character. But the editors, not
              knowing the use of this <hi rend="italic">cup,</hi> alter'd it to
              &lsquo;cap.&rsquo;&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Heath</hi> (p. 414): Mr
              Warburton's religious zeal is alarmed at the common reading, &lsquo;my
              cap,&rsquo; which he therefore alters to <hi rend="italic">my cup,</hi> but it
              unfortunately happens that, being in the street, he hath no cup at hand to make the
              libation out of; and though Mr Warburton understands this to be an engagement, that he
              will go home and offer the libation aforesaid, yet he seems in no great haste to
              acquit himself, but tarries on the stage until the procession is ended. In truth this
              gentleman's religion needed not have been so immoderately scrupulous. Here was no
              prophaneness intended. Menenius, on hearing the good news of Marcius, his return with
              victory, throws up his cap into the air as a token of his exultation; and at the same
              time that he thanks Jupiter offers him his cap, being the first thing that came to
              hand, as an acknowledgement of his protection of the republic. This is followed by a
              huzza in the usual form: &lsquo;Hoo, Marcius coming home!&rsquo; Now what
              reason can be given why our poet might not have imagined a cap thrown up into the air
              with thanks as acceptable an offering to Jupiter as a libation, at least till an
              opportunity of offering the latter should present itself? But be this as it will, the

              proposed by Mason might perhaps be admitted, though it is extremely harsh, and the

              over with very great attention before I could find what other meaning could be adduced
              from Mr Mason's note, but at last I found that he must suppose Mr Mason explains the
              passage thus, &lsquo;He comes the third time home, with the oaken garland on's
              brows,&rsquo; a construction, as express'd, very uncongenial with Shakespeare's
              prose style. By comma I conceive Mason meant generally a stop; there is a colon in
              this edition. I prefer a period. This direction should have convinced Mr Malone that
              there was no idea of connecting so closely &lsquo;his brows&rsquo; with what

              is not adding three to Volumnia's seven and making nine of them. He corrects her

              that no fewer than 240 persons marched, in stately procession, across the stage. In
              addition to the recognised <hi rend="italic">dramatis person&aelig;,</hi>
              thirty-five in number, there were vestals, and lictors with their fasces, and soldiers

              been content to follow in the beaten track of those who had gone before her she would
              have marched across the stage, from right to left, with the solemn, stately, almost
              funereal, conventional step. But at the time, as she often did, she forgot her own
              identity. She was no longer Sarah Siddons tied down by the conventions of the
              prompter's book; she broke through old traditions&mdash;she recollected that, for
              the nonce, she was Volumnia, the proud mother of a proud son and conquering hero. So
              that, when it was time for her to come on, instead of dropping each foot at
              equi-distance in its place, with mechanical exactitude and in cadence subservient to
              the orchestra; deaf to the guidance of her woman's ear, but sensitive to the
              throbbings of her haughty mother's-heart, with flashing eye and proudest smile, and
              head erect, and hands pressed firmly on her bosom, as if to repress by manual force
              its triumphant swellings, she towered above all around, and rolled, and almost reeled
              across the stage; her very soul, as it were, dilating and rioting in its exultation;
              until her action lost all grace, and yet became so true to nature, so picturesque, and
              so descriptive that pit and gallery sprang to their feet, electrified by the

              here he seems to appear in a light the very reverse of such a character; for when the

              out, &lsquo;No more of this; it does offend my heart.&rsquo; He manifests the

              the people in order to get himself elected Consul, he answers in the same style and
              spirit of character. But these seeming contradictions form in effect but one character
              still. The overvaluing his merits, and the undervaluing the applause of them, are both
              equally founded in pride, fierceness, and impatience. Plutarch </p>

              Coriolanus terms Volumnia [<hi rend="italic">sic.</hi>] his &ldquo;gracious
                silence.&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

                Notes,</hi> 855; ed. Cook &amp; Wedderburn, xiv, p. 16): In the whole compass of
              Shakespeare's conceptions the two women whom he has gifted with the deepest souls are
              Cordelia and Virgilia. All his other women can speak what is in them. These two
              cannot. The &lsquo;Nothing, my lord,&rsquo; of Cordelia, and the
              &lsquo;gracious silence&rsquo; of Virgilia are the everlasting seals set by
              the Master of the </p>
            <p>human heart upon the most sacred writing of its folded and golden leaves. Shakespeare
              himself could not find words to tell what was in these women. [Few, I think, realize
              how profound was the influence of Shakespeare upon the poetic soul of John Ruskin. In
              Cook &amp; Wedderburn's definitive edition of his writings the Shakespearian
              references occupy ten columns of the Index; that is, five large 8vo
                pages.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">C.
                &amp; M. Cowden Clarke</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi>): This name for
              his wife, who, while the others are receiving him with loud rejoicings, meets and
              welcomes him with speechless silence looking out from her swimming eyes, is conceived
              in the very fulness of poetical and Shakespearian perfection. It comprises the
              gracefulness of beauty which distinguishes her, and the gracious effect which the
              love-joy has upon him who shrinks from noisy applause and even from merely expressed
              approbation; and it wonderfully concentrates into one felicitous word the silent
              softness that characterizes Virgilia throughout. She is precisely the
              woman&mdash;formed by nature gentle in manner, and rendered by circumstances
              sparing in speech&mdash;to inspire the fondest affection in such a man as
              Coriolanus; and we accordingly find him a passionately attached husband. The few words
              he addresses to her in the course of the play are among the most intense utterances of
              spousal enamouredness that even Shakespeare has written. The dramatic portrait of
              Virgilia we have always considered to be one of the very finest of the poet's
              sketch-productions. It is put in with the most masterly touches; it paints her by very
              few strokes, very few colours; but they are so true, so exquisitely artistic that they
              present her to the life. She is supremely gentle, and, like most women whose
              gentleness is their chief characteristic, singularly immoveable, not to say obstinate,
              when once resolved; she is habitually silent, as the wife of such a man as Coriolanus
              and the daughter-in-law of such a woman as Volumnia would undoubtedly become, being
              naturally of a gentle disposition; and this combination of gentleness and silence is
              wonderfully drawn by Shakespeare throughout the character-portrait, and as wonderfully
              condensed here into one expressive name.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi> (<hi

              The modern editors have needlessly assigned this speech to Coriolanus. While
              Coriolanus speaks with Virgilia Cominius turns to </p>
            <p>Volumnia, from whom he once more returns to Menenius. Thus his deprecating
              &lsquo;O my sweet lady, pardon&rsquo; is most easily interpreted, otherwise we
              should not know wherewith to connect it. [Schmidt's interpretation strikes me as both
              awkward and undramatic. The speech palpably belongs to Coriolanus; the words
              &lsquo;And live you yet&rsquo; are addressed jocularly to the older man,
              Menenius, who has just addressed Coriolanus for the first time since his entrance. He
              then catches sight of Valeria, and turns to her, asking her pardon for neglecting her
              unwittingly. Theobald had evidently a sense of the theatre keener than that of
              Schmidt.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Gordon</hi> suggests that the words of pardon

              <hi rend="smallcap">Theobald</hi>: &lsquo;Change of honours&rsquo; is a very

                <hi rend="italic">charge,</hi> i. e., a fresh charge or commission. These words are
              frequently mistaken for each other. So, afterwards, in this play: &lsquo;And yet

              Coriolanus&mdash;esteeming his own family name an honourable title, one of

              unusual, especially as it is not plain just what <hi rend="italic">honour</hi> is

              is near an unsuspected downfall. This elaborate description would be out of place in a
              modern play, because the increased capabilities of stage-effect would allow the scene
              to be represented more effectually to the eye. But for the rudimentary condition of
              the Elizabethan theatre we should have lost some of Shakespeare's finest descriptive

              destruction as the enemy of the People, and it is just that they should do it.
              Coriolanus deserved death. The talk of Sicinius and Brutus, admirably conceived by
              Shakespeare, proves them masters of the situation. It is marked by that pitilessness
              towards the oppressing class which has characterised, in all revolutions of the
              people, the leaders of the people; and at the back of which is the long hatred of

              The influence of Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> upon Goethe is
              noteworthy. George Lewes in his novel-like biography of Goethe refers to the
              parallelism between <hi rend="italic">Egmont,</hi> V, i, and <hi rend="italic"
                >Coriolanus,</hi> II, i, 221-237, [the present passage. This is not strictly true.
              Lewes quotes a passage from <hi rend="italic">Egmont,</hi> V, i, which he translates
              as </p>
            <p>follows: &lsquo;Stay! Stay! Shrink not away at the sound of his name, to meet
              whom ye were wont to press forward so joyously! When rumour announced his approach,
              when the cry arose, &ldquo;Egmont comes! he comes from Ghent!&rdquo; then
              happy were they who dwelt in the streets through which he was to pass. And when the
              neighing of his steed was heard, did not every one throw aside his work, while a ray
              of hope and joy like a sunbeam from his countenance, stole over the toil-worn faces
              which peered from every window. Then as ye stood in doorways ye would lift up your
              children and, pointing to him, exclaim, &ldquo;See! that is Egmont! he who towers
              above the rest! 'Tis from him ye must look for better times than those your poor
              fathers have known!&rdquo;&rsquo; Lewes says in his general criticism of <hi
                rend="italic">Egmont</hi> that it &lsquo;was conceived in the period when Goethe
              was under the influence of Shakespeare; it was mainly executed in the period when he
              had taken a classical direction. It wants the stormy life of G&ouml;tz and the
              calm beauty of <hi rend="italic">Iphigenia.</hi>&rsquo; Lewes does not, however,
              compare this with the present lines in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi> The
              parallelisms between the passage in <hi rend="italic">Egmont</hi> and <hi
                rend="italic">Jul. C&aelig;s.,</hi> I, i, 42-52 is, to me, much more striking.
              Marullus there berates the Citizens for their forgetfulness of Pompey in a strain
              similar to that in <hi rend="italic">Egmont,</hi> and in a like
                situation.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's Sh.</hi>) compares this present passage
              with the above lines in <hi rend="italic">Jul. C&aelig;s.,</hi> adding:
              &lsquo;In either case the street-architecture seems that of Elizabethan London.
              Another example of Shakespeare's power of suggesting to the mind's eye some crowded,
              moving pageant is that wonderful picture (praised so by Dryden) of Bolingbroke's
              stateentry into London with King Richard in his train, <hi rend="italic">Richard
              II:</hi> V, ii, 1-40. No doubt the use of these long passages of description was due
              to the lack of scenery on the Elizabethan stage, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> of
              means to appeal to the physical eye. The classical example is the scene in <hi
                rend="italic">King Lear</hi> (IV, vi, 11-22), where the blind Gloucester wishes to
              throw himself from what he supposes to be Dover Cliff. Compare also the description of
              the cliff at Elsinore, <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> I, iv, 70-78. The same thing is
              felt in the prologues of <hi rend="italic">Henry V,</hi> especially <hi rend="italic"
                >Prol.</hi> iv. (describing the camp-scenes on the eve of Agincourt).&rsquo;

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Theobald</hi>, in a letter to Warburton dated Feb. 12, 1729-30,
              says: &lsquo;This passage, I remember, stuck with us when I read this Play in
              company. What means a baby crying <hi rend="italic">into a rapture?</hi> That, I
              suppose, can never signify crying itself into fits. We struck out this conjecture,
              which I beg leave to submit to you, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">E'en to a
              rupture</hi> lets her baby cry,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> lets it cry

                <hi rend="italic">Illust. of Lit.,</hi> vol. ii, p. 483). Warburton either forgot
              this or was unimpressed by its merit; in his edition his only note on this line is as
              follows: &lsquo;&ldquo;Rapture,&rdquo; a common term at that time used for
              a fit, simply. So, <hi rend="italic">to be rap'd,</hi> signified <hi rend="italic">to
                be in a fit.</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;S. W.: If the explanation of Bishop Warburton
              be allowed, a &lsquo;rapture&rsquo; means a <hi rend="italic">fit;</hi> but it
              does not appear from the note where the word is used in that sense. The right word is,
              in all probability, <hi rend="italic">rupture,</hi> to which children are liable </p>
            <p>from excessive fits of crying. The emendation was the property of a very ingenious
              scholar long before I had any claim to it. [These initials, S. W., stand for Stephen
              Weston, the erudite and versatile antiquary who contributed a number of notes to
              Johnson and Steevens edition, 1785; later these were privately printed and issued in
              1808 under the title: <hi rend="italic">Short Notes on Shakespeare by way of
                Supplement to Johnson, Steevens, Malone, and Douce.</hi> This small volume is now a
              very rare Shakespearian item, but the notes, as may be seen by the foregoing, are not
              of any very great value as Shakespearian commentary. The &lsquo;ingenious
              scholar&rsquo; to whom Weston refers is undoubtedly Theobald, possibly he was
              informed of this emendation by one of those present &lsquo;in company&rsquo;
              when Theobald read the play and &lsquo;stuck&rsquo; at this
                line.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Steevens</hi>: That a child will &lsquo;cry itself into fits&rsquo; is still
              a common phrase among nurses. That the words <hi rend="italic">fit</hi> and <hi
                rend="italic">rapture</hi> were once synonymous may be inferred from the following
              in <hi rend="italic">The Hospital for London's Follies,</hi> 1602, where Gossip Luce
              says, &lsquo;Your darling will weep itself into a rapture, if you take not good
              heed.&rsquo; [This very apposite illustration has been frequently repeated by
              later commentators, but thus far no one has verified it by reference to the work
              itself. This has doubtless caused the plainly voiced suspicion of E. K. Chambers that
                <hi rend="italic">The Hospital for London's Follies</hi> existed in the fertile
              imagination of Steevens. That the Puck of Commentators was not above such a prank is
              not to be gainsaid; examples of such are unfortunately quite frequent, but in no case
              with such circumstance of detail as here. That is, with full title, date, and name of
              interlocutor. The form Steevens chose was generally a vague title, without date or any
              means of identification. Thus: Old black-letter ballad of sixteenth century, the exact
              title of which he conveniently had forgotten. In the present case the work to which he
              refers is evidently a composition in prose, anonymous, and is now lost. A careful
              search through the voluminous catalogue of the library of Isaac Reed, which required
              thirty-eight days for the complete sale, and one also through the list of works
              comprising Steevens's own library, has been barren of certain results in placing this
              work to which Steevens refers. In the Reed Catalogue, No. 8349, among a mixed lot of
              plays there is one entitled <hi rend="italic">Hospital for Fools,</hi> which is given
              in Baker's <hi rend="italic">Biographia Dramatica,</hi> with the date of production at
              Drury Lane Theatre, 1739; this is, of course, so late as to throw it out of court. In
              the Steevens list item No. 914 is <hi rend="italic">The Hospital of Incurable
              Fools,</hi> 1600. These are the nearest approaches to the title given by Steevens that
              I have been able to discover. A careful search of Arber's <hi rend="italic">Transcript
                of the Stationer's Registers</hi> from 1599 to 1604 has failed to bring to light
              this very rare composition. It is not included in Halliwell's <hi rend="italic"
                >Dictionary of Old English Plays;</hi> in Hazlitt's <hi rend="italic">Manual;</hi>
              in W. W. Greg's <hi rend="italic">Lists of Plays and Masques,</hi> or in Chambers's
              exhaustive list. It is thus evidently one of those prose tracts in dialogue form which
              were so common at that period.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi

              through much crying.&rdquo; This emendation was independently proposed by two
              other critics; and it seems </p>
            <p>as good as an emendation can be; yet it has never been adopted, because it was
              conceived that the word in the text admitted of explanation and defense. Certainly
              &ldquo;rapture&rdquo; is just <hi rend="italic">seizure;</hi> cf. Chapman's

              Mr J. P. Collier (<hi rend="italic">Farther Particulars,</hi> p. 41) quotes the
              parallel passage from the novel on which Shakespeare's play was founded: the hero says
              he got to land &ldquo;with a jewell whom all the raptures of the sea could not
              bereave from his arme.&rdquo; But there seems no sufficient authority for the
              employment of &ldquo;rapture&rdquo; in the sense of <hi rend="italic">fit</hi>
              or <hi rend="italic">convulsion;</hi> and that being so, we adhere to Blackstone's
              emendation, and believe that just as <hi rend="italic">rapture</hi> in <hi

                rend="italic">rapture.</hi> At the same time we must bear in mind that Steevens
              adduced, in support of the old text a quotation which at least must give us

                rend="sup">th</hi> of that year contained an article on the Perkins Folio [Collier's
              annotated Folio of 1632.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]. The writer pretended
              to prove that the manuscript notes were a modern fabrication, on the single ground
              that, in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> II, i, in the passage &lsquo;While she
              chats him&rsquo; the Corrector had superseded &lsquo;chats&rsquo; by <hi
                rend="italic">cheers.</hi> The writer in <hi rend="italic">The Bulletin</hi> argued
              thus: &lsquo;The verb &ldquo;to cheer,&rdquo; in the amended passage, is
              used in its modern sense of hurrahing, or shouting approvingly. Now in Shakespeare's
              time, and for 150 years afterwards&mdash;we believe we might state a longer
              period&mdash;the word had no such signification, and therefore it is evident that
              the &ldquo;old corrector's&rdquo; alteration is a modern deception.&rsquo;
              . . . The first statement is &lsquo;begged.&rsquo; If &lsquo;to
              cheer&rsquo; in the passage &lsquo;While she <hi rend="italic">cheers</hi>
              him,&rsquo; be taken in the sense of <hi rend="italic">to enliven,</hi> the sense
              is perfect, and <hi rend="italic">to cheer</hi> is used in an Archaic sense. The
              second statement is utterly untrue. To <hi rend="italic">cheer</hi> in Shakespeare's
              day was used in the &lsquo;sense of hurrahing or shouting approvingly.&rsquo;
              Thus, in Phaer's translation of the <hi rend="italic">&AElig;neid,</hi> the words
              &lsquo;Excipiunt plausa pavidos&rsquo; (v, 575) is rendered, &lsquo;The
              Trojans them did chere&rsquo;; and this book was first published in 1558. [Fifteen
              years later Ingleby, in <hi rend="italic">Sh. Hermeneutics</hi> (p. 148), dismisses
              this same passage with this brief remark: &lsquo;Let us premise that
              &ldquo;him&rdquo; here means Marcius, not the baby. &ldquo;Chats
              him&rdquo; is, we think, corrupt; and many conjectures have been made, all alike
              inadmissible. Perhaps &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">claps</hi> him&rdquo; is the
              best, but the metre halts for it.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">C. &amp; M. Cowden Clarke</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi>): The word &lsquo;chats&rsquo; seems to us
              thoroughly characteristic in expressing <hi rend="italic">gossips of, talks
              about;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">of</hi> or <hi rend="italic">about</hi> being
              elliptically understood after &lsquo;chats&rsquo; gives a touch of familiar
              flippancy and slip-shod effect to the sentence which we think appropriate. The phrase
              almost anticipates the more modern commonism, or nursemaid idiom, &lsquo;while she
              chats him over.&rsquo;&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi>: That is,
              while she gossips about him. &lsquo;Chats&rsquo; is looked upon as a
              suspicious word, and &lsquo;chats <hi rend="italic">to</hi>&rsquo; or
              &lsquo;chats <hi rend="italic">of</hi>&rsquo; have been proposed. The former
              is ob</p>
            <p>viously impossible. [Not surprising; it is Seymour's proposal.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] But, after all, there is no absolute reason for change.
              Although we have no other instance of &lsquo;chat&rsquo; being use
              transitively, there is the analogous use of &lsquo;speak,&rsquo; to which <hi
                rend="smallcap">Schmidt</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Lex.</hi>) refers. See II, ii, iii,
              and <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline,</hi> I, i, 24, &lsquo;You speak him
              far.&rsquo; Again in <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII:</hi> IV, ii, 32, &lsquo;Yet
              thus far, Griffith, gives me leave to speak him. [In reference to Singer's
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">claps</hi> him&rsquo; Wright urges the same
              objection as that by the anonymous writer in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's Maga.,</hi>
              viz., that it is not explained how the nurse could hold the baby and clap her hands at
              the same time. I am loath to add another to the several conjectural changes in the
              word &lsquo;chats&rsquo;; but with great diffidence suggest that, as it is
              evident that the populace is supposed to be in expectation of the appearance of
              Coriolanus, the word here may be <hi rend="italic">waits;</hi> the close proximity of
              the two words, almost synonymous, &lsquo;prattling&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;chats,&rsquo; seems hardly in Shakespeare's manner. Thus the prattling
              nurse while waiting for Coriolanus lets her baby weep itself into a fit. In the
              handwriting of the time <hi rend="italic">waits</hi> and &lsquo;chats&rsquo;
              are not very dissimilar.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              but rather something wherein one takes pleasure, even though it be not very valuable,
              and what one regards and protects as an ornament. Thus the only admissible meaning of
              &lsquo;nicely-gawded&rsquo; here is protects with pains and with care, or, by
              means of a veil, carefully escapes the stroke of the sun. [In his <hi rend="italic"
                >Lexicon,</hi> a few years later, <hi rend="smallcap">Schmidt</hi> places these
              words, <hi rend="italic">nicely-gauded,</hi> under a separate caption </p>
            <p>with the definition, &lsquo;scrupulously treated as a precious thing, carefully
              guarded and preserved,&rsquo; with the present passage as the only example of this
              usage.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Kinnear</hi> (p. 310) refers the words
              &lsquo;nicely-gauded&rsquo; to the scarfs or veils with which the ladies
              covered their faces, on the strength of ll. 299-301: &lsquo;Matrons flong gloves,

              equally far-fetched and needless, when so simple a meaning can be given as that of
              Wright. It is to be borne in mind that Brutus is here speaking quite as contemptuously
              of the Ladies as of the Kitchen Malkin. The one he considers beneath him, the others
              he despises simply because they are aristocrats, he a representative of the common
              people. The words &lsquo;nicely gauded&rsquo; are used as a covert

              <hi rend="smallcap">Capell</hi> (vol. I, pt i, p. 86): The author's intended sense in
              these lines can be no other than that Marcius could not carry his honours temperately
              from beginning to end, but it will be hard to find from beginning to end of his works
              one that is worse express'd.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: </p>
            <p>Our author means, though he has expressed himself most licentiously, he cannot carry
              his honours temperately from where he should begin <hi rend="italic">to where he
                should end.</hi> The word &lsquo;transport&rsquo; includes the ending as
              well as the beginning. He cannot begin to carry his honors, and conclude his journey,
                <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the spot <hi rend="italic">where he should begin,
              and</hi> to the spot where he should <hi rend="italic">end.</hi> I have no doubt that
              the text is right. The reading of the old copy is supported by a passage in <hi
                rend="italic">Cymbeline,</hi> where we find exactly the same phraseology:
              &lsquo;&mdash;the gap That we shall make in time, from our hence going And our
              return, to excuse,&rsquo; [III, ii, 64]. Where the modern editors read

              will begin by claiming too much, and he will not know where to stop. &lsquo;From
              where he should begin and end&rsquo; is usually explained as, from where he should
              begin, to where he should end; and a similar expression is quoted from <hi
                rend="italic">Cymbeline.</hi> The passage in <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline</hi> admits
              of no other explanation, but here it seems better to connect &lsquo;transport . .
              . and end&rsquo;&mdash;He will not know how to advance temperately, step by
              step of honour, from a modest and wise beginning&mdash;and so temperately
                end.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi> in his ed. i. accepts without
              question Malone's interpretation; in his ed. ii. he adopts, however, a conjectural
              reading by Seymour, &lsquo;to th' end,&rsquo; acknowledging that at the time
              of receiving this into the text he was not aware that he had thus been anticipated; as
              his reason for making this change he says: &lsquo;I have tried in vain to make any
              sense out of the Folio reading; and the strained yet futile attempts which have been
              made at explaining it are, to me, strong argument of its being wrong; for by the same
              methods almost any words may be made to yield almost any sense. Another reading has
              occurred to me, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">'Tween</hi> where he should begin and
              end.&rdquo; This would give the same sense, or nearly the same, as the reading in
              my text. And as the capitals F and T are commonly written, either might easily be
              mistaken for the other; under which mistake the rest of the word would naturally be
              assimilated accordingly.&rsquo;&mdash;[That the capitals F and T are somewhat
              alike in modern script is quite true, but they did not resemble one another in the
              handwriting of Shakespeare's time. Capital F was represented by simply doubling the
              minuscule <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> while T was a crescent-shaped curve opening to the

              &lsquo;Teach&rsquo; may be explained through a logical anacoluthon, which is

              forgotten by the speaker. At the same time it is to be remembered that &lsquo;to

              to be: &lsquo;When his insolence shall teach the people their mistake, and the
              danger of putting this present hero in authority.&rsquo; His insolence is to begin

                >1 Henry VI.</hi> in its continuous exploitation of the permanent and peculiar
              architectural features of an Elizabethan playhouse. I retain the word
              &ldquo;stagery,&rdquo; which Milton used in a cognate but slightly different
              sense, because I mean much less than
              &ldquo;stage-craft&rdquo;&mdash;indeed, only that part of stage-craft
              which concerns the problems of the producer or stage manager, who has to move his
              actors and appointments about the stage like pieces on a chess-board. For that reason
              I should like to make what may seem the trivial suggestion that a comma in the First

              seems to me likely to convey &ldquo;pretending to place imaginary

              Cushions seem to have been used instead of stools when a number of players had to be

              impartially holds the scales. With this temper it is natural that the arrogance of
              success, lack of nous, and want of adaptability&mdash;which is often merely
              another form of self-will&mdash;should bring about Coriolanus's ruin; and it is

                (<hi rend="italic">Notes &amp; Queries,</hi> 7 May, 1881, p. 362): The phrase
                [<hi rend="italic">to have thern</hi>] was commonly used in the west fifty years
              ago, and is probably used still. It meant to be in, or more fully to come into, a
              certain state. If some persons who had become embarrassed had recovered their
              position, it would be said of them, &lsquo;They hau (have) themsels neaw aw
              reet,&rsquo; and sometimes, though more rarely, &lsquo;They hau them aw
              reet.&rsquo; . . . It is a genuine Teutonic idiom. The German ironical pbrase,
              &lsquo;Es hat sich wohl,&rsquo; answers to our vulgar English &lsquo;That
              is a good one.&rsquo; The meaning, I think, is that Coriolanus was not like those
              &lsquo;supple and courteous&rsquo; men, who took off their bonnets to the
              people in order to come into their estimation, and (good) report, but by his deeds had

              <hi rend="smallcap">Theobald</hi> (ed. i.): I cannot help making a remark upon this
              circumstance of our Author's conduct, whether casual or designedly. It is said, and
              the fact is true, that he has followed Plutarch very closely in this story, but he
              deviates from him in one point, by which he seems to decline a strange absurdity in
              the calculation of time. Shakespeare tells us that at sixteen years old, Coriolanus
              began his soldiership, when Tarquin made head to regain his kingdom; and that in <hi
                rend="italic">seventeen battles</hi> he distinguished himself with exemplary bravery
              and success. Plutarch likewise says that our Hero set out in arms a youth, that his
              first expedition was when Tarquin made this push, and that he signalized himself in
              war for seventeen years successively. Now it happens a little unluckily for Plutarch's
              account that this attempt of Tarquin was made A. U. C. 258, and Coriolanus was
              banished, nay, and killed within the period of eight years after his first Campaign,
              A. U. C. 266. There is something again lies cross on the other side, that if
              Coriolanus was so young when he commenced soldier, and if the interval was so short
              between that and his banishment, he was too young to have been admitted a candidate
              for the Consulship. The compli</p>
            <p>ment of that office so early to any man was a prostitution of dignity that, I think,
              was never made till the times of the Emperors, when servitude had debased the very
              spirits of the Romans. 'Tis certain there is some mistake in the computation of this
              great man's years. I should conjecture (were there any proofs to second it) that he
              started into notice as a soldier when Tarquin was expelled Rome, A. U. C. 245; and
              allowing him to be only eighteen years of age then, at the time of his own banishment
              (A. U. C. 264) we shall find him 37 years old, a period of life at which the City
              could scarcely have refused one of his extraordinary merit the Consulship. But this is
              no more than an attempt to reconcile improbabilities by guess. [<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Malone</hi> likewise calls attention to this inconsistency between the figure
              seventeen and the number of years covering the career of Coriolanus; he also
              exonerates Shakespeare since he was evidently misled by Plutarch both in the
              translation and the original. On this latter point <hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi>
              (p. 490) says: &lsquo;In Plutarch the number of years is prescribed by his
              mythical chronology, for he dates the beginning of Marcius's career from the wars with
              the Tarquins, which were supposed to have broken out in 245 A. U. C., while Corioli
              was taken in 262; but when transferred to the battles it becomes a mere survival which
              serves at most to give apparent definiteness.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              &lsquo;lurch,&rsquo; is found in this technical sense [&lsquo;to win a
              maiden set at cards&rsquo;] in most European languages, there is no proof that the
              word existed in English, nor, if it did, would it suit the context. Shakespeare
              evidently uses the English verb &lsquo;lurch&rsquo; literally, to devour
              eagerly, &lsquo;ravin up,&rsquo; gulp down, and in the secondary sense to
              seize violently upon, rob, engross, absorb. Both noun and verb were in use among the
              Elizabethan writers in the sense of seizure, rob</p>
            <p>bery, and it is the more important to illustrate this meaning, as the noun is wholly
              unknown to our lexicographers. An instance of its use occurs, however, in the poems
              prefixed to <hi rend="italic">Coryat's Crudities,</hi> where one of the author's
              friends commemorates his achievements abroad, and amongst others the robbery of a

              [lines by Richard Badley]. Again the verb is used more than once, in precisely the
              same sense, by Warner, and an example or two will sufficiently bring out its special
              meaning. In reference to the rage of the vulgar wealthy for titles and territorial
              distinction he says: &lsquo;Hence country louts land-lurch their lords, and
              courtiers prize the same,&rsquo; [<hi rend="italic">Albion's England,</hi> Bk ix,
              ch. 46, ed. 1602, p. 217.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]. And again,
              referring to the grasping ambition of Spain as the nominal champion of the Romish
              Church, &lsquo;For these elsewhere, and ever Spayne when Spayne would sceptres
              lurch,&rsquo; [<hi rend="italic">Albion's England,</hi> Bk x, ch. lx, ll. 15, 16].
              In the sense of engrossing, of seizing and carrying off with a high hand,
              &lsquo;lurch&rsquo; is also used amongst others by Bacon and Milton. To
              &lsquo;lurch all swords of the garland&rsquo; means, therefore, not only to
              rob all swords of the garland, but to carry it away from them with an easy and
              victorious swoop. [The foregoing in regard to this word &lsquo;lurch&rsquo;
              was seriously questioned, among other statements in Baynes's Review, by Bolton Corney
              in <hi rend="italic">Notes &amp; Queries,</hi> Nov. 27, 1869, and in particular
              the concluding interpretation of the present passage, which, it will be noticed, is
              substantially the same as that offered by Malone. Corney ends his review thus:
              &lsquo;I request particular attention to this matchless instance of parallelism!
              It appears that the solution of a Shakespearean problem published by an author of note
              in 1790 [Malone] may be unfairly stated, denounced as a <hi rend="italic">misinter
                pretation,</hi> and re-produced by the same critic as a discovery, and as a <hi
                rend="italic">special</hi> illustration, in 1869.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi>: If we may
              regard the passage in Ben Jonson's <hi rend="italic">Silent Woman,</hi> V, i, as a
              reminiscence of the expression in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> Shakespeare's
              play must have been written before 1609, the year in which <hi rend="italic">The
                Silent Woman</hi> appeared. Malone first called attention to the resemblance between
              the two passages, thinking that Jonson intended a sneer at Shakespeare, but he
              afterwards abandoned this view on finding a similar expression in a pamphlet by Nashe,
              and he supposed it to be a common phrase of the time. [See Gifford's Jonson, vol. iii,
              p. 495, note.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] But in Nashe there is only the
              word &lsquo;lurch,&rsquo; which is of frequent occurrence, and the combination
              of this with &lsquo;the garland&rsquo; by Ben Jonson seems to me to indicate
              that he had Shakespeare's phrase in mind, whether he intended to sneer at it or not,
              and I am inclined to attach to the coincidence more weight than Malone felt himself
              justified in doing. [Wright in his note on this line quotes the two examples of
              &lsquo;lurch&rsquo; as given by Steevens and Malone above, and adds:
              &lsquo;Cotgrave has, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Bredouille:</hi> f. A lurch at
              cards, at tables.&rdquo; Again, showing whence the word came to us, &ldquo;<hi
                rend="italic">Lourche:</hi> f. The game called Lurche; or, a Lurch in game. Il
              demeura lourche. He was left in the lurch.&rdquo; Further: &ldquo;Ourche. The
              game at Tables called Lurch. Among sites to be avoided in building Bacon (<hi
                rend="italic">Essay xlv,</hi> ed. Wright, p. 681) enumerates: &ldquo;Too farre
              off from great Cities, which may hinder Businesse; Or too neare them, which Lurcheth
              all Provisions, and maketh every Thing deare.&rdquo; Here
              &ldquo;lurch&rdquo; is used in the sense of <hi rend="italic">absorb, swallow
                up,</hi> like the Latin <hi rend="italic">lurcare,</hi> from which it is probably
              derived.&rsquo;&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Henry Irving Sh.</hi>): There are at least two words, <hi rend="italic">lurch</hi>
              (1) a verb, a form of <hi rend="italic">lurk,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">Merry
                Wives,</hi> II, ii, 26, &lsquo;I . . . am fain to shuffle, to hedge, and </p>
            <p>to lurch,&rsquo; from which sense arose that of <hi rend="italic">stealing;</hi>
              and (2) a game at cards, from the French <hi rend="italic">lourche. . . .</hi> In the
              present passage there seems to be a suggestion of these various meanings: Coriolanus
              stole the honors from his companions, yet at a fair game leaving them in the
                lurch.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Skeat</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dict.</hi> s. v.)
              differentiates three significations of &lsquo;lurch&rsquo;: (1) To lurk,
              dodge, steal, pilfer (Scand.). In illustration of these meanings he gives the passage
              from <hi rend="italic">Merry Wives</hi> quoted above by Beeching and the present
              passage. (2) The name of a game. Skeat quotes the references to Cotgrave as given by
              Wright; and since Cotgrave gives <hi rend="italic">Ourche</hi> as the name, suggests
              that &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">lourche</hi> stands for <hi rend="italic"
              >l'ourche,</hi> the initial <hi rend="italic">l</hi> being merely the definite
              article.&rsquo; (3) To devour. Under this head, in illustration, Skeat quotes the
              passage from Bacon already given by Wright, deriving it, as does Wright, from Late
              Latin <hi rend="italic">lurcare,</hi> to devour greedily.
              &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; adds Skeat, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">lurch</hi> (3)
              is really <hi rend="italic">lurch</hi> (1), to filch, the Latin verb being falsely
              mixed up with it.&rsquo; [The <hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi> likewise gives these
              same three significations besides other technical meanings. Under vb. 1, 2. To
              defraud, rob, steal, the present line is quoted.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              capricious alteration has been adopted in all the subsequent editions. In the same
              page of that copy, which has been the source of at least one-half of the corruptions
              that have been introduced in our author's works, we find <hi rend="italic">defamy</hi>
              for &lsquo;destiny,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">sir</hi> Coriolanus, for

              found admission into any of the modern editions except Mr Rowe's. <hi rend="italic"
                >Rushes</hi> falling below a vessel passing over them is an image as expressive of
              the prowess of Coriolanus as well can be conceived. A kindred image is found in <hi
                rend="italic">Tro. &amp; Cress.,</hi> &lsquo;&mdash;there the strawy
              Greeks, ripe for his edge, Fall down before him, like the mowers swath,&rsquo; [V,
              v, 24].&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Waves,</hi> the
              reading of the second Folio, I regard as no trivial evidence in favour of the copy
              from which it was printed. &lsquo;Weeds&rsquo; instead of <hi rend="italic"
                >falling below</hi> a vessel under sail cling fast about the <hi rend="italic"
              >stem</hi> of it. The justice of my remark every sailor and waterman will confirm. But
              were not this the truth, by conflict with a mean adversary, valour would be
              depreciated. The submersion of <hi rend="italic">weeds</hi> resembles a Frenchman's
              triumph over a <hi rend="italic">soupe aux herbes;</hi> but to rise above the
              threatening billow, or force a way through the watery bulwark, is a conquest worthy of
              a ship, and furnishes a comparison suitable to the exploits of Coriolanus. Thus in <hi
                rend="italic">Tro. &amp; Cress.,</hi> &lsquo;The strong-ribb'd bark through
              liquid mountains cuts, Bounding between the two moist elements, </p>
            <p>Like Perseus' horse,&rsquo; [I, iii, 41]. If Shakespeare originally wrote <hi
                rend="italic">weeds,</hi> on finding such an image less apposite and dignified than
              that of <hi rend="italic">waves,</hi> he might have introduced the correction which Mr
              Malone has excluded from his text. The <hi rend="italic">stem</hi> is that end of the
              ship which leads. From &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">stem</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                >stern</hi>&rsquo; is an expression used by Dryden in his translation of Virgil,
              &lsquo;Orontes&rsquo; bark . . . From stem to stern by waves was
              overborne,&rsquo; [Bk i, ll. 162-164].&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Boswell</hi>:
              &lsquo;Weeds&rsquo; is used to signify the comparative feebleness of
              Coriolanus's adversaries.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Knight</hi>: Of the
              correctness of the original [&lsquo;weeds&rsquo;] we think there can be no
              doubt. <hi rend="italic">Waves</hi> falling before the stem of a vessel under sail is
              an image which conveys no adequate notion of a triumph over petty obstacles; a ship
              cuts the waves as a bird the air; there is opposition to the progress, but each moves
              in its element. But take the image of weeds encumbering the progress of a vessel under
              sail, but with a favoring wind dashing them aside, and we have a distinct and
              beautiful illustration of the prowess of Coriolanus. Steevens says: &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">Weeds,</hi> instead of falling below a vessel under sail, cling fast
              about the stem of it.&rsquo; But Shakespeare was not thinking of the weed floating
              on the billow; the Avon or the Thames supplied him with the image of weeds rooted at
              the bottom.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verplanck</hi>: The <hi rend="italic"
              >weeds</hi> of the flats of the Hudson and the inlets of Long Island Sound have so
              often furnished the American editor with a practical illustration of this image, that
              he has no hesitation in adopting this as the true reading.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Delius</hi>: The reading of the Folio is here undoubtedly correct.
              As the weeds bend before the stem of the advancing ship, so do the enemies fall
              together before Coriolanus. The word &lsquo;stem,&rsquo; particularly
              applicable to a vessel, is here not so particularly applied to Coriolanus or his
              sword.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Singer</hi> (ed. ii.): I think, with Steevens,
              that a vessel <hi rend="italic">stemming the waves</hi> is an image much more suitable
              to the prowess of Coriolanus than the displacing of weeds.&mdash; <hi
                rend="smallcap">C. &amp; M. Cowden Clarke</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
              >Shakespeare</hi>): We think that the original word gives the effect of contemptible
              impediments overcome better than the substituted word, which presents the idea not of
              opposers or opposition, but of due medium, waves being the natural upbearers of a
              ship, and forming its path or course.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Lettsom</hi> (ap.
                <hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi> ii.): Read <hi rend="italic">waves</hi> with the
              Second Folio. The sense requires a circumstance that happens usually, <hi
                rend="italic">not exceptionally,</hi> to ships under sail.&mdash; <hi
                rend="smallcap">Whitelaw</hi>: The reading of the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Folio is
              more appropriate, expressing in the helplessness of the Volscians before Coriolanus
              his heroic and superhuman prowess, whereas the image of a ship stemming the waves
              would rather suggest that his courage triumphed over superior strength. Again,
              &lsquo;waves&rsquo; could hardly be said to fall under the vessel's stem. </p>

              meaning of the passage is changed by it, and changed for the worse. The crucial
              passage to elucidate this elaborate metaphor is <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> I, i,
              162: &lsquo;The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike, No fairy
              takes.&rsquo; &lsquo;Takes&rsquo; is in its good Elizabethan sense of <hi

              that the metaphor is continued to the end. </p>
            <p>Coriolanus's sword infects &lsquo;from face to foot.&rsquo; He is
              &lsquo;a thing of blood,&rsquo; not in the sense that he was covered with
              blood, but like the Avenging Angel. The &lsquo;shunless destiny&rsquo; with
              which he paints &lsquo;the mortal gate of the city&rsquo; is a reminiscence of
              the plague-mark on the door of an infected house [W. A. Wright]. And finally he
              &lsquo;struck Corioles like a planet,&rsquo; because
              &lsquo;planet-stricken&rsquo; was the name for sudden death for which the
              doctors could assign no cause. The metaphor is splendidly sustained, and it is simply
              because Tyrwhitt did not recognise that &lsquo;takes&rsquo; bore the still
              familiar sense of vaccination, &lsquo;taking,&rsquo; that he altered the

                <hi rend="italic">3 Henry VI:</hi> I, iv, 12, &lsquo;with purple falchion,
              painted to the hilt in blood,&rsquo; but here the word expresses <hi rend="italic"
                >representation</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">colour.</hi> So perhaps <hi
                rend="italic">Tro. &amp; Cress.,</hi> I, i, 93, &lsquo;Helen must needs be

            <p><hi rend="smallcap">Schmidt</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>):
              &lsquo;Which&rsquo; is here commonly related to gate, but perhaps it is to be
              related to &lsquo;city,&rsquo; and &lsquo;painted&rsquo; a word
              falsely read by the compositor, conformably <hi rend="italic">haunted.</hi>
              Shakespeare is fond of using <hi rend="italic">to haunt</hi> as applied to a

              Coriolanus set his bloody mark upon the gate, or upon the city, indicating that it was
              his by an inevitable fate, as plague-stricken houses were painted with a red
                cross.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>):
              &lsquo;Shunless destiny&rsquo; may be simply blood destined to flow, the blood

              &ldquo;shunless destiny&rdquo; of the first-born of the Egyptians.&rsquo;
              [Shakespeare was, I think, too well versed in Old Testament History to have been
              unmindful of the fact that the blood was struck upon the lintels and was to be a sign

            <p><hi rend="italic">both</hi> Consuls. And then the people, assisted by the seditious
              temper of the Tribunes, got the choice of one. But if Shakespeare makes Rome a

              into an aristocracy. But it would be unjust to attribute this entirely to his

              which, when once lighted up, made all acquired knowledge fade and disappear before it.
              For sometimes again we find him, when occasion serves, not only writing up to the
              truth of history, but fitting his sentiments to the nicest manners of his peculiar

              statement on the authority of Cato. Now Amyot in his French translation, which is the

              well persuaded, as Mr Warburton can be of the contrary, that &lsquo;this was <hi
                rend="italic">not</hi> intended as a ridicule on the Augustine&rsquo; (it should
              be the Augustinian) &lsquo;manner of defining free-will at that time in the
              schools.&rsquo; The present expression, indeed, is no other than the natural
              dictate of an honest heart, which Shakespeare felt in its full force. The sense is, We
              have indeed a power by law to do it if we think proper, but this power amounts to the
              same as no power at all, because we should offer the greatest violence to our very
              natures if we should exert it. Thus much I thought it right to say in justification of
              this sentiment, which considered as Shakespeare intended it, as a moral sentiment, is
              a very fine one, and a very serious one; not a ludicrous one, as Mr Warburton, wrapped
              up in his verbal metaphysics, would represent it. But to consider it in the
              metaphysical light in which he hath chosen to place it, I would beg leave to ask him
              one question. Doth he know what was the Augustinian definition of free will, which in
              Shakespeare's time, or at any time before, or since, obtained in the schools? I am
              persuaded he doth not, or he could never have thought the ridicule, he hath gone out
              of his way to fasten upon it, would suit it. But I believe the truth of the case is
              this, Mr Warburton had formerly read the <hi rend="italic">Provincial Letters,</hi> in
              the first of which the <hi rend="italic">pouvoir prochain</hi> of the Dominican
              Thomists . . . is very finely and very strongly ridiculed, and that in a manner which
              bears a distant resemblance to the text of our poet. This probably might give the hint
              to his confused imagination to transfer a misunderstood ridicule upon a doctrine to
              which it is no way applicable. For let me ask him another question. Had he himself the
              power while he was writing this note to throw up the sash of his study window and leap
              out of it? I suppose he will scarce deny that he had the power to do so; but that
              power being under the control of another power, which belonged to him as a moral
              agent, I suppose too he will as little deny, that, upon the result of the combination
              of those two powers, he had not, as then circumstanced, the power to exert the
              physical power. If he should deny it, the common sense of mankind will bear witness
              against him. This is the very case in our poet's text. The man had in himself the
              power to do it, but it was a power he had no power to exert. But thus it will always
              be with people who affect to know everything. They are at every turn betraying their
              ignorance of the very rudiments of what they will be talking about. </p>

              passage in North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Life of
              Romulus,</hi> p. 26, ed. 1579) may perhaps afford us some clue: &lsquo;Moreover
              other birdes are allwayes (as a man would saye) before our eyes, and doe daylie shewe
              themselves unto us: where the vulter is a very rare byrde and hardly to be seene, and
              men do not easily finde their ayeries. Which hath geven some occasion to holde a false
              opinion that the vulters are passagers, &amp;c. The prognosticators also thincke
              that such things which are not ordinarie and but rarely seene, be not natural, but
              miraculously sent by the gods </p>
            <p>to prognosticate something.&rsquo; Now we have no doubt that Coriolanus here
              wishes that his dealings with the people were as transitory and rare as the visits of
              vultures are to the gaze of the soothsayers. He never wishes to encounter them more,
              not even to hear their praises. But then how is this passage to be moulded according
              to this view? Shall we read, &lsquo;I wish they would forget me like the vultures
              Which our diviners lease by&rsquo;; or, Which our divines lose sight of? Let the

              [It is, I think, doubtful that Badham's extravagant emendation or explanation will
              appeal to any thoughtful reader. He himself would very likely have somewhat modified
              his view had he consulted the several passages wherein Shakespeare refers to the
              Vulture. In no instance is this bird taken except as the emblem of voracity, which
              honor it seems to share with the cormorant. The words &lsquo;virtues&rsquo;
              and <hi rend="italic">vultures</hi> in the handwriting of the time do not in the least

              priestly teachers of morals in a heathen land may not well be termed
              &lsquo;divines&rsquo; by an English poet without implying that he supposed
              them to be doctors of divinity of Oxford or Geneva. [As far as I know Verplanck
              himself is the first to call attention to the anachronism&mdash;his edition
              appeared in 1847&mdash;the &lsquo;dozen critics&rsquo; are all named John

              None of the commentators have informed us what were the precepts by which Coriolanus

              I should rather suppose that he borrowed his simile from the Faculty, and that we

              [The deferential tone of Spence's note somewhat precludes severe criticism, still it
              may be pointed out that &lsquo;victim&rsquo; is a word which does not occur in

              It is all very well for the candidate to turn this off with a flout, but it is the

              more sanity of judgment than Coriolanus ever possessed; that he should nevertheless
              cast his vote for such an applicant shows more generosity as well. And the generosity,
              if also the simplicity, of the electors is likewise made more pronounced than in
              Plutarch by their persevering in their course despite the scorn with which Coriolanus
              treats them; of which Plutarch, of course, knows nothing. Even that they forgive till
              the tribunes irritate the wounds and predict more fatal ones from the new weapon that

                rend="smallcap">Ibid.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Variorum 1778</hi>): Since the
              foregoing note was written I met with the following passage in <hi rend="italic">A
                Merye Jest of a Man called Howleglas,</hi> bl. l. no date, Howleglas hired himself
              to a taylor, who &lsquo;caste unto him a husbandemans gowne, and had him take a
              wolfe, and make it up, Than cut Howleglas the husbandmans gowne and made thereof a <hi

              maister, I ment that you should have made up the russet gown, for a husbandmans gowne
              is here called a wolfe.&rsquo; By a <hi rend="italic">wolvish</hi> gown, therefore
              (if <hi rend="italic">gown</hi> be the true reading), Shakespeare might have meant
              Coriolanus to compare the <hi rend="italic">dress of a Roman candidate</hi> to the <hi
                rend="italic">coarse frock of a ploughman,</hi> who exposed himself to solicit the
              votes of his fellow rustics.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Mason</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Comments,</hi> etc., p. 251): Whether we read <hi rend="italic"
              >gown</hi> or <hi rend="italic">toge</hi> is of little consequence, as they have both
              precisely the same meaning, and I should be rather inclined to read <hi rend="italic"
                >gown</hi> than <hi rend="italic">toge,</hi> merely because that is the language of
              Coriolanus in the scene preceding, where he says, &lsquo;I cannot Put on the gown,
              stand naked,&rsquo; &amp;c. The only difficulty of the passage lies in the
              word &lsquo;woolvish.&rsquo; It cannot mean, as Johnson supposes, a rough <hi
                rend="italic">hirsute</hi> gown, for Brutus calls it, a little before,
              &lsquo;The napless vesture of humility.&rsquo; The supposing that there is an
              allusion to the wolf in sheep's clothing is rather a ludicrous idea, and should be
              treated as such. Nor can I suppose that Shakespeare meant to compare the gown, which
              he calls <hi rend="italic">the napless vesture of humility,</hi> and from the </p>
            <p>whiteness of which the competitors for the consulate derived their name, to the
              coarse frock of a ploughman. I therefore suppose that the passage is corrupt, because
              it is inexplicable as it stands. Perhaps we should read <hi rend="italic">woolen</hi>
              instead of &lsquo;woolvish&rsquo;; yet that would not sufficiently distinguish
              it from any other gown, as they were probably all made of that material. I should,
              therefore, rather suppose that we ought to read <hi rend="italic">foolish,</hi> which
              agrees with what Coriolanus says in the latter part of this speech, &lsquo;Rather
              than fool it so, Let the high office and the honour go.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: So in <hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi> &lsquo;the
              toged consuls,&rsquo; [I, i, 25]. I suppose the meaning is: &lsquo;Why should
              I stand in this gown of humility, which is little expressive of my feelings towards
              the people, as far from being an emblem of my real character as the sheep's clothing
              on a wolf is expressive of his disposition.&rsquo; I believe
              &lsquo;woolvish&rsquo; was used by our author for false or deceitful, and that
              the phrase was suggested to him, as Mr Steevens seems to think, by the common
              expression &lsquo;a wolf in sheep's clothing.&rsquo; Mr Mason says that this
              is &lsquo;a ludicrous idea, and ought to be treated as such.&rsquo; I have
              paid due attention to many of the ingenious commentator's remarks in the present
              edition [1790], and therefore I am sure he will pardon me when I observe that
              speculative criticism on these plays will ever be liable to error, unless we add to it
              an intimate acquaintance with the language and writings of the predecessors and
              contemporaries of Shakespeare. If Mr Mason had read the following line in Churchyard's
                <hi rend="italic">Legend of Cardinal Wolsey, Mirror for Magistrates,</hi> 1587,
              instead of considering this as a ludicrous interpretation, he would probably have
              admitted it to be a natural and just explication of the epithet before us,
              &lsquo;O fye on wolves that march in masking clothes,&rsquo; [p. 516, ed.
              1610. See also <hi rend="italic">1 Henry VI:</hi> I, iii, 55, and <hi rend="italic">2
                Henry VI:</hi> III, i, 78.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]. The <hi
                rend="italic">woolvish</hi> (gown) or <hi rend="italic">toge</hi> is a gown of
              humility, in which Coriolanus thinks he shall appear in <hi rend="italic"
              >masquerade,</hi> and not in his real or natural character. <hi rend="italic"
              >Woolvish</hi> cannot mean <hi rend="italic">rough, hirsute,</hi> as Dr Johnson
              interprets it, because the gown Coriolanus wore has already been described as <hi
                rend="italic">napless.</hi> The old copy has &lsquo;tongue&rsquo;; which was
              a very natural error for the compositor at the press to fall into, who almost always
              substitutes a familiar English word for one derived from the Latin, which he does not
              understand. The very same mistake has happened in <hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi>
              where we find &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">tongued</hi> consuls&rsquo; for
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">toged</hi> consuls.&rsquo; The particle
              &lsquo;in&rsquo; shows that &lsquo;tongue&rsquo; cannot be right. The
              editor of the Second Folio solved the difficulty as usual by substituting <hi
                rend="italic">gown</hi> without any regard to the word in the original
                copy.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Douce</hi>: Mr Steevens has, in his note on this
              passage, cited the romance of Howleglas to show that a husbandman's gown was called a
                <hi rend="italic">wolf,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">quaere</hi> if it be called so in
              this country? It must be remembered that Howleglas is literally translated from the
              French, where the word &lsquo;loup&rsquo; certainly occurs, but I believe it
              has not the same signification in that language. The French copy also may be <hi
                rend="italic">literally</hi> rendered from the German. [Douce is probably correct in
              saying that the version from which Steevens quotes is a translation from the French,
              but the title <hi rend="italic">Howleglas</hi> is undoubtedly a translation of the

              however, clearly right in supposing the allusion to be to the &lsquo;wolf in

              wolf, but merely to say: &lsquo;Why should I stand here playing the hypocrite, and
              simulating </p>

              sheep's clothing, adding as his own contribution to the discussion a comparison of the
              passage in <hi rend="italic">All's Well,</hi> &lsquo;it will wear the surplice of
              humility over the black gown of a big heart,&rsquo; I, iii, 98.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Knight</hi>: We believe that the correction of
              &lsquo;tongue&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">gown</hi> is right. It is difficult
              to say whether &lsquo;woolvish&rsquo; means a gown made of wool, or a gown
              resembling a wolf, or <hi rend="italic">wolfish.</hi> We adopt the latter opinion; for
              it is no proper description of the gown of humility to call it woollen. By <hi
                rend="italic">wolfish</hi> Coriolanus probably meant to express something hateful.
              The notion of Steevens that the allusion was to the wolf in sheep's clothing seems
              merely fanciful.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verplanck</hi>: Steevens, I think, is
              right in interpreting &lsquo;woolvish&rsquo; as <hi rend="italic"
              >deceitful,</hi> in allusion to the familiar phrase of &lsquo;a wolf in sheep's
              clothing.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why should I make myself like the wolf, affecting a
              humility I have not?&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Delius</hi>: That
              Coriolanus here by the words &lsquo;wolvish togue&rsquo; means the despised
              gown, that he according to custom must wear to obtain the peoples voices, is clearer
              than in just what sense the word &lsquo;wolvish&rsquo; is used; whether in
              reference to the coarse, repellant exterior, wherein Coriolanus appears like a wolf,
              or in reference to the contradiction between this humble outside show and his own
              inner feeling of spite and ferocity like a wolf in sheep's clothing. The first
              elucidation is much the simpler and more natural. Perhaps, though, <hi rend="italic"
                >togue</hi> is not the word to be sought in &lsquo;tongue,&rsquo; but rather
                <hi rend="italic">throng,</hi> and by &lsquo;wolvish <hi rend="italic"
              >throng</hi>&rsquo; is meant the Plebeians who press around Coriolanus like wolves
              around their prey.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Notes
                &amp; Emendations,</hi> etc., p. 354): &lsquo;Woolvish&rsquo; is nothing
              but a lapse by the printer, who, earlier in the play, did not know what to make of
              &lsquo;napless&rsquo; and called it
              &lsquo;Naples&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;the Naples vesture of
              humility&rsquo;; here, again, he did not understand what he was putting in type,
              and therefore committed a singular, and hitherto inexplicable, blunder. A manuscript
              note in the Folio, 1632, sets all right, and offers a most acceptable
                emendation&mdash;&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">woolless</hi> togue.&rsquo; As
              the toga was &lsquo;napless,&rsquo; so it was <hi rend="italic">woolless,</hi>
              an alteration for the better, that carries conviction on the very face of it. Are we
              to impute it merely to the sagacity of the early possessor of the Folio, 1632, when
              nobody since his time has had any notion of the sort? or are we to suppose that he had
              in this instance, and in some others, a guide by which his speculations were
                assisted?&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Singer</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sh.

              &lsquo;wolvish&rsquo; there is another singular coincidence with a hint by Mr
              Collier in his edition where attention is called to the gown being <hi rend="italic"
                >napless.</hi> In regard to <hi rend="italic">woolvish</hi> toge (or gown) the idea
              is quite evident; Coriolanus says, Why should I stand here playing the hypocrite, in
              this gown of humility, like the <hi rend="italic">wolf</hi> in sheep's clothing?
              Whether the gown had a <hi rend="italic">nap</hi> on it or no would hardly enter here
              into the mind of the poet or of Coriolanus. It is sufficient that it was <hi
                rend="italic">simulating</hi> humility not in his nature to bring to mind the fable
              of the <hi rend="italic">wolf.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Anon.</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Blackwood's Maga.,</hi> Sep., 1853, p. 322): In this instance we side
              most cordially with the margins and Mr Collier against Mr Singer and the ordinary
              text. The haughty Coriolanus, who is a candidate for the consulship, says,
              &lsquo;Why in this wolvish gown should I stand here?&rsquo; Now Shakespeare,
              in a previous part of the play, has described the candidate's toga as &lsquo;the
                <hi rend="italic">napless</hi> vesture of humility&rsquo;; and it is well-known
              that this toga was of a </p>
            <p>different texture from that usually worn. Is it not probable, therefore&mdash;nay
              certain&mdash;that Coriolanus should speak of it as <hi rend="italic"
              >woolless,</hi> the word &lsquo;wolvish&rsquo; being altogether
              unintelligible? Mr Singer, defending the old reading, says it is sufficient that his
              investiture in this gown &lsquo;was <hi rend="italic">simulating</hi> humility not
              in his nature to bring to mind the fable of the <hi rend="italic"
              >wolf.</hi>&rsquo; Oh, Mr Singer! but must not the epithet in that case have been
                <hi rend="italic">sheepish?</hi> Surely, if Coriolanus had felt himself to be a wolf
              in sheep's clothing, he never would have said that he was a sheep in wolves' clothing!
              [Foot-note to above passage: &lsquo;The German translators, Tieck and Schlegel,
              adopt the reading of the First Folio and translate: &ldquo;Warum soll hier mit
              Wolfsgehuel ich stehen.&rdquo; Dr Delius concurs with his countrymen, and remarks
              that the boldness of Shakespeare's constructions readily admits of our connecting the
              words &ldquo;in this wolfish tongue&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;to
              beg.&rdquo; Now, admirable as we believe Dr Delius' English scholarship to be, he
              must permit us to say that this is a point which can be determined only by a native of
              this country, and that the construction which he proposes is not consistent with the
              idiom of our language. Even the German idiom requires <hi rend="italic">with</hi>
              (mit), and not <hi rend="italic">in,</hi> a wolf's cry. We cannot recommend him to
              introduce <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> into his text of our
              poet.&rsquo;&mdash;The Anonymous Critic has, I think, somewhat misunderstood
              Delius, who does not justify the Schlegel-Tieck translation entirely, but says:
              &lsquo;The endeavors to retain the readings of the Folio at all costs frequently
              cause our German critics to set at defiance all rules of English grammar, even in the
              case of this passage, and to attribute the anomaly thus produced to the peculiarity of
              the Shakespearian usage of language&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">Die Tieck'sche

                rend="smallcap">Tycho Mommsen</hi> (p. 175): &lsquo;Wolvish tongue&rsquo; is
              unintelligible, and neither by auditor nor reader can be connected with &lsquo;to

              preceding passage, where instead of the somewhat unusual word
              &lsquo;hire&rsquo; he wrote the unintelligible stupid word <hi rend="italic"

              &lsquo;toged consuls.&rsquo; The wolfish dress may be either the coarse skin
              of the wolf, or the dress of the wolf in sheep's clothing; the former (though good and
              formative in itself) requires that we lay greatest stress upon <hi rend="italic"

                >gown</hi> be read. And this word, so thoroughly appropriate, is not supplied by the
              original text. Thus we are constrained to decide in favor of the MS. Corrector, since
                <hi rend="italic">woolless</hi> corresponds most closely with the poet's idea of the
              classic dress of the candidate. The copyist and reader were most wofully at fault not
              only with the two words &lsquo;hire&rsquo; and &lsquo;toge,&rsquo; but
              also with a third, <hi rend="italic">woolless,</hi> since they did not understand <hi
                rend="italic">togue</hi> and took it for <hi rend="italic">tongue,</hi> thus
              &lsquo;woolvish tongue&rsquo; seemed to them a much better sense than
              &lsquo;woolless tongue&rsquo;; thus they tinkered with the (oldest) texts.
              Perhaps also the handwriting here was somewhat illegible.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">R. G. White</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sh. Scholar,</hi> p. 360): Where
              is the propriety, especially the poetic propriety, of calling the sheep-skin
              &lsquo;wolf's clothing&rsquo; merely because the wolf wore it? The moment it
              became wolf's clothing, that moment it ceased to be a disguise, and lost all
              significance; and besides, &lsquo;wolfish&rsquo; means not
              &lsquo;belonging to a wolf,&rsquo; but &lsquo;like a wolf.&rsquo;
              Unquestionably, Shakespeare would never have called a woollen toga
              &lsquo;woolless&rsquo;; and the new reading [of Collier's MS. </p>
            <p>Corrector] cannot be accepted. But since neither &lsquo;wolfish&rsquo; nor
                <hi rend="italic">woolless</hi> give a consistent meaning, let us look at the
              original line, the context, and the other passages of the play, which have a bearing
              upon this one. The word in the corrupted text seems to have misled all the
              commentators upon the passage. They evidently regard Coriolanus when standing for the
              consulship as feeling what our border-men call &lsquo;wolfish about the head and
              shoulders.&rsquo; But the text affords no support for this opinion. Coriolanus
              feels contempt for the people; he derides the custom, and thinks that it belittles him
              to conform to it. What Brutus says of him shows no ireful feeling on his part, but
              merely that he thought the ceremony very small business, [II, i, 250-255]. Coriolanus
              himself says on a previous occasion: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;I'd rather have one
                scratch my head in the sun,<lb/> When the alarum were struck, than idly sit<lb/> To
                hear my nothings monstered,&rsquo; II, ii, 82-84.<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>It makes him shame-faced to go through this foolery. When told that he must,
              according to precedent, speak to the people, he replies: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;I
                do beseech you,<lb rend="RIGHT"/> Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot<lb/> Put
                on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,<lb/> For my wounds' sake, to give their
                suffrage: please you<lb/> That I may pass this doing&rsquo;, II, ii,
                148-152.<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> It is a part<lb/> That I
                shall blush in acting, and might well<lb/> Be taken from the people.<lb/>
                <hi rend="italic">Bru.</hi> Mark you that?<lb/>
                <hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;<lb/> Show them
                the unaching scars which I should hide,<lb/> As if I had received them for the
                hire<lb/> Of their breath only!&rsquo; Ibid., 159-165.<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing of a wolf in sheep's clothing or a sheep in wolf's clothing in all
              this. He regards the custom as contemptible, foolish. The same feeling appears when he
              stands in the Forum; and there he says to a Citizen, with a sneer, &lsquo;I have
              here the customary gown.&rsquo; So again, when he has received the &lsquo;most
              sweet voices&rsquo; of the people and is told by the Tribunes and Menenius to go
              to the Senatehouse to be invested, he asks: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;<hi
                  rend="italic">Cor.</hi> May I change these garments?<lb/>
                <hi rend="italic">Sic.</hi> You may, sir.<lb/>
                <hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,<lb/>
                Repair to the senate-house&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">supra</hi> 150-154).<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>He looks upon the ceremony as a preposterous piece of folly, and thinks that the
              vesture of humility makes a patrician appear ridiculous.
              &lsquo;Wolfish,&rsquo; we have seen, is inadmissible; <hi rend="italic"
                >woolless</hi> is equally so, because the toga which Coriolanus wore was made of
              wool. Is it not plain then that, merely continuing his ridicule, he said,
              &lsquo;Why in this <hi rend="italic">foolish</hi> togue should I stand
              here?&rsquo; Yes, unquestionably, </p>
            <p>for in this very speech, after only five lines which impeach the binding force of
              custom, he says, &lsquo;Rather than <hi rend="italic">fool it</hi> so Let the high
              office and the honor go.&rsquo; The word in the original is
              &lsquo;wooluish&rsquo;; and that it is a typographical error for <hi
                rend="italic">foolish</hi> is confirmed by the fact that in not one of the fifty
              instances in which Shakespeare uses &lsquo;wolf,&rsquo;
              &lsquo;wolvish,&rsquo; or &lsquo;wolves,&rsquo; does he spell those
              words or are they spelled with two <hi rend="italic">o's.</hi>&mdash;<hi

              unconscious of having been anticipated by Mason (whose conjecture is not mentioned in

                <hi rend="italic">foolish</hi> is the genuine reading.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              &lsquo;the napless vesture,&rsquo; etc. That &lsquo;Tongue&rsquo; of
              the Folio is a mistake for <hi rend="italic">toge</hi> we might have been sure, even
              if a similar error were not found in <hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi> I, i,
                [&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Tongued Consuls</hi>&rsquo;]. [In his Notes on
              this play, which appeared about five years after the foregoing remarks, White
              completely changed his view; he there says: &lsquo;&ldquo;Why in this wolvish
                <hi rend="italic">gown</hi>&rdquo;&mdash;i. e., in this gown, in which, to
              attain my own ends, I assume a virtue&mdash; humility&mdash;which I have not,
              like the wolf in sheep's clothing. The First Folio has &ldquo;woolvish
              tongue,&rdquo; which has been almost universally regarded by modern editors as a
              misprint for &ldquo;this woolvish <hi rend="italic">toge.</hi>&rdquo; But with
              this opinion I cannot agree. For nowhere else does Shakespeare use
              &ldquo;toge&rdquo; or even &ldquo;toga,&rdquo; or any word formed from
              it, often as there was opportunity, almost occasion, in his classical plays. And
              besides, in the passage of North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> which he was here
              dramatising, we have &ldquo;a poore gowne&rdquo; and &ldquo;a simple
              gowne,&rdquo; but no mention of a toga; and Shakespeare, we know, stuck closely to
              his authority in such cases&mdash; even to its words when they were names of
              things. The misprint of &ldquo;tongue&rdquo; for &ldquo;gowne&rdquo;
              is not so extravagant but that it might occur even nowadays; and for these reasons,
              therefore, it seems most probable that the editor of the Second Folio was right in
              reading &ldquo;this wolvish gowne.&rdquo; We might read: &ldquo;Why, in
              this wolvish tongue, should I stand here To beg,&rdquo; &amp;c., <hi
                rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> &ldquo;Why should I stand here to beg in this
              deceitful tongue&rdquo;; but the speaker's reply to his own question,
              &ldquo;Custom wills me to't,&rdquo; forbids. Custom enjoined upon him only the
              napless vesture of humility and the solicitation. Of the various conjectural readings
              proposed for this passage, no others appear worthy of
                mention.&rsquo;]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Staunton</hi>: Possibly, after
              all that has been written about it, the term &lsquo;woolvish&rsquo; may have
              been intended to apply to the mob, and not the vestment, and the genuine reading be
              &lsquo;wolfish <hi rend="italic">throng.</hi>&rsquo; [See Note by Delius, <hi

              clothing. Not by any means that the poet meant to make Coriolanus call himself a wolf;
              but he regards the figure in question merely as a general image of one trying to seem
              what he is not; and so makes the speaker apply it to himself simply as one who stands
              there clad in &lsquo;the napless vesture of humility,&rsquo; while his heart
              is full of pride and disdain towards the part he is acting, and towards those whose
              suffrage he is asking. Brutus expresses the same thing afterwards: &lsquo;With a
              proud heart he wore his humble weeds.&rsquo; [In his ed. ii. Hudson's note is

            <p>believe &lsquo;woolvish&rsquo; is correct, and that it refers to some
              well-known article of dress; for a wolf-gown is referred to in an inventory dated
                1559.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">C. &amp; M. Cowden Clarke</hi> (<hi

              misprint for some other word, we think, is nearly as manifest. But inasmuch as we feel
              none of the proposed substitutions to be the probable emendation, we allow
              &lsquo;woolvish&rsquo; to remain in the text. It is from this desire to leave
              the original unaltered, if possible, that we refrain from inserting the word here

                >slavish</hi> exactly suit the context of this speech, but <hi rend="italic"
              >slavish</hi> perfectly accords with the epithets used both by Plutarch and by
              Shakespeare when mentioning the garment that Coriolanus wears on the present occasion.
              In <hi rend="italic">Timon,</hi> IV, iii, 205, we find the expression &lsquo;This
              slave-like habit,&rsquo; which testifies Shakespeare's employment of a similar
              expression with regard to coarse and common raiment. While suffering
              &lsquo;woolvish&rsquo; to occupy its place in the text, we must explain that
              it is usually supposed to mean <hi rend="italic">wolf-like,</hi> but, judging from
              another passage in this play (III, ii, 12), we should rather take it to mean
              &lsquo;woollenish,&rsquo; &lsquo;wooll'nish&rsquo; or
              &lsquo;wool'nish,&rsquo; which last elisionally abbreviated form of the word
              brings us almost precisely to the Folio spelling and printing. [See Note by the
              Clarkes on III, ii, 12.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Whitelaw</hi>: If &lsquo;woolvish&rsquo; can mean <hi

              the poor gown,&rsquo; it may perhaps be explained by comparison with <hi

              woolward for penance.&rsquo; Perhaps Shakespeare wrote <hi rend="italic"
              >woollish</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">woolish</hi>)&mdash;the strangeness of the

              plebeians are spoken of as &lsquo;woollen vassals.&rsquo; The toge or gown was
              thus one &lsquo;made of coarse woolen stuff or frieze, too coarse to have any <hi

              garment worn <hi rend="italic">threadbare</hi> by a plebeian, and none other could
              wear it.&rsquo; [Kinnear also quotes from a sumptuary law (Elizabeth 13) which
              enjoined the wearing of woolen caps for all but the nobility; this seems, however, but
              little to the purpose, as the law does not make any mention of other articles of

              the poet has chosen evidently in reference to the saying, Who keeps company with
              wolves will learn to howl. Why should I, asks Coriolanus, submit to this wretched
              situation and howl with wolves?&rsquo; After reviewing the various attempts at
              amending the passage, Schmidt concludes his note with a special objection to
              Steevens's <hi rend="italic">toge</hi> or <hi rend="italic">togue,</hi> characterising
              it as the most inadmissible which the poet could have used.&mdash;<hi

              considers that the passage in <hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi> so often cited in this

              is generally explained as an inverted reference to the wolf in sheep's </p>
            <p>clothing, but though Menenius called Coriolanus a sheep (II, i, 10), he would hardly
              call himself one. A more likely explanation would be: Why <hi rend="italic">like the
                wolf</hi> should I be thus masquerading? Or can it refer to the Roman wolf, <hi
                rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> the Roman people?&mdash;Miss <hi rend="smallcap"
                >Porter</hi> (<hi rend="italic">First Folio Sh.</hi>): Malone might have added in
              support of his change, <hi rend="italic">toge,</hi> that the were-superstition, or the
              changing of men into wolves, was a commonplace of the superstition of Shakespeare's
              day, and that one of the characteristics of the were-wolf was that he could turn his
              skin inside out when he wanted to masquerade in a &lsquo;napless gown,&rsquo;
              hence the pertinence of the phrase. Steevens is not altogether happy in the form of
              his explanation. That Coriolanus should desire to indulge in his &lsquo;usual
              ferocity&rsquo; seems to convict him of the wolfishness he here abhors. The best
              comment on the text, as it stands, is the character of Coriolanus, as drawn by
              Shakespeare, and his peculiar dislike to howls in public over deeds he accounts
              incumbent upon nobility to accomplish for the love of virtue, as a matter of course,
              and in silence. He refuses at first (ii, 163) &lsquo;To brag unto them, thus I
              did, and thus&rsquo;; later (iii, 49-53), &lsquo;What must I say . . . ?
              Plague upon't, I cannot bring my tongue to such a pace.&rsquo; When Menenius begs
              him &lsquo;speak to 'em in wholesome manner,&rsquo; he even then tells the
              Citizens that he never yet desired &lsquo;to trouble the poor with
              begging&rsquo; (iii, 75, 76); finally he bursts out against standing <hi

              reason whatsoever for any other word here than <hi rend="italic">tongue.</hi> He
              objects consistently to howling with the wolves, yelling with the pack, the common
              &lsquo;cry of curs,&rsquo; as he says later.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              expected in this place, and if it were quite certain that <hi rend="italic">toged</hi>

              Urquart's <hi rend="italic">Rabelais.</hi> The force of &lsquo;woolvish&rsquo;
              presents an equal difficulty. It is supposed that the material of the woollen gown is

              clothing.&rsquo; Coriolanus with pride and hate in his heart wears the gown of

              of the Cambridge and Globe editors, which is substantially that of Steevens,

                rend="italic">wolvish</hi> toge,&rsquo; and are thus constrained to adopt
              Steevens's interpretation, that there is here an allusion to the fable of the wolf in
              sheep's clothing. With this view I am disposed to agree, notwithstanding the cogent
              objection made to it by the Anonymous contributor to <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's
                Magazine,</hi> that if there be meant such a reference it should be
              &lsquo;sheepish&rsquo; dress, not <hi rend="italic">wolfish;</hi> but it is
              quite plain that had this latter word been the one employed </p>
            <p>there would scarcely have been any reader or auditor who would apply it in the sense
              intended; Coriolanus would have been compared to a lamb led to the slaughter; and then
              no one, since the time of its first mention until 1853, had noticed the discrepancy.
              As a very slight contribution to this long note, and in equally small corroboration of
              the Folio reading, I offer the following: In Gascoigne's translation of the Italian
              comedy <hi rend="italic">Gli Suppositi,</hi> entitled <hi rend="italic">Supposes,</hi>
              occurs the following line, &lsquo;T&omacr;gues? I pray you what did my
              t&omacr;gue ever hurt you?&rsquo; I, iii. (p. 196, ed. Cunliffe). Here, as is
              often the case, the letter <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is represented by a mark placed
              over the &otilde;. Possibly the word <hi rend="italic">togue</hi> in the present
              line was the one occurring in the MS., and the compositor, not understanding, thought
              that the mark over the <hi rend="italic">o</hi> was simply omitted, as a man might
              omit to dot an i or cross a t; it may be noticed also that in the text the word
              directly above &lsquo;Tongue&rsquo; is &lsquo;which&rsquo;; the long
              descending turn of the second letter, <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> might have seemed to

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Joseph Hunter</hi> (ii, 118): We can never sufficiently appreciate
              the depth of the wisdom in this wonderful man. He seems to be acquainted with every
              political or moral maxim, and to know what is to be said in favor of it or against it.
              His views are also often pre</p>
            <p>sented, as in this instance, with inimitable felicity, so simply, so easily, so
              gracefully, the metaphor so beautifully kept up to the end, and the meaning so clearly
              and vividly brought out. There is more of his political wisdom in this play, in <hi
                rend="italic">Timon,</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> than in
              any other of the plays.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Kreyssig</hi> (i, 491): The
              train of thought in this speech shows Coriolanus already to have abandoned the single
              indispensable rule of life of the conservative aristocracy. His own subjective
              consciousness he turns against sacred custom. He forgets that every prerogative
              becomes, and must become, a bond for him who enjoys it; that unconditional personal
              freedom leads to isolation, and is incompatible with the struggle for power. And thus
              he is driven to his fate before the wind of passion. In this scene the drama easily
              displays its highest skill.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Snider</hi> (ii, 229):
              Coriolanus cannot submit to an institution&mdash;his individual will is supreme.
              This first discipline of office&mdash;the suppression of his personal caprice and
              the submission to the established custom&mdash;cannot be endured by him. Hence on
              this side he is as revolutionary as the plebeians. The two parties thus reach the same
              point&mdash; the destruction of the institutions which restrain their tendencies.
              The patricians, however, as the true conservative element of society seek to
              conciliate both sides and to retain the ancient laws and customs of the
                nation.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">J. C. Collins</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Studies
                in Sh.,</hi> p. 82): A sentiment peculiarly characteristic of the Greeks was their
              superstitious reverence for what was popularly accepted and become custom. This
              continually finds expression in the Greek dramas, and is, indeed, woven into the very
              fabric of their ethics. We need go no further than a line in Sophocles, as it is
              typical of innumerable other passages, &lsquo;what custom establishes outmasters
              truth,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Frag.</hi> 84, and Euripides, <hi rend="italic"
                >Bacch&aelig;,</hi> 894, &lsquo;What has long been custom, is
              divine.&rsquo; This is exactly Shakespeare's philosophy, [the present line
              quoted], &lsquo;Our virtues Lie in the interpretation of the time&rsquo; (IV,
              vii, 51, 52), but illustration would be endless.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Brandes</hi> (ii, 253): Coriolanus is utterly unaware that this speech of his strikes
              at the very root of that ultra-conservatism which he affects. The very thing he has
              refused to understand is, that if we invariably follow custom the follies of the past
              would never be swept away, nor the rocks which hinder our progress be burst asunder.
              To Coriolanus, what is customary is right, and he never realises that his disdain for
              the Tribunes and people has led him into a politically untenable position. We are by
              no means sure that Shakespeare's perceptions in this case were any keener than his
              hero's, but, consciously or unconsciously, it is this very inconsistency in
              Coriolanus's character which makes it so vividly lifelike.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 601): It is characteristic of this spirit [of
              self-centred confidence and egotism] which really makes a man a law unto himself and
              the measure of all things, that though by all his training and prejudices inclined to
              the traditional and conservative in politics, yet, if use-and-wont presses hard
              against his own pride, he shows himself an innovator of the most uncompromising kind.
              Coriolanus objects once and again to the prescriptive forms of election. [In this and
              the following lines] he blossoms out as the reddest of radicals, though a radical of
              the Napoleonic type. </p>

              ashamed of his apparent boasting, and adds, therefore, the qualifying words,

              quizzing the people by affected magniloquence, from which he occasionally lapses into
              irony. The effect on the people would be to puzzle them, which would be partly
              Coriolanus's intention. It is perhaps allowable to call attention to the excellent
              development of this scene. At first Coriolanus is simply cross and speaks shrewishly
              to the citizens; then he recovers his good temper and is chiefly bored by them; then
              when they refer to his wounds he becomes angry again and almost resolves to give up
              the consulship; finally he reflects that as the ceremony is half over he may as well
              finish it, and for the remainder of the time throws himself into the part with

              <hi rend="smallcap">Warburton</hi>: This was a strange inattention. The Romans at this

              custom&rsquo; that Coriolanus should say, the custom which requires the consul to

              elected, unless by the voice of the people that rule should be broken through. This
              would meet with the objection made in note on &lsquo;teach,&rsquo; II, i, 279;
              but I doubt much whether Shakespeare knew the precise consular age </p>
            <p>even in Tully's time, and therefore think it more probable that the words
              &lsquo;aged custom&rsquo; were used by our author in their ordinary sense,
              however inconsistent with the recent establishment of consular government at Rome.
              Plutarch had led him into an error concerning this &lsquo;aged custom.&rsquo;

              was not yet twenty years old, but Shakespeare was not thinking of dates when he wrote
              this. [An inattention on the part of Shakespeare more interesting, I think, than the
              question of date is to be found in the fact of his giving to the <hi rend="italic">3

              his soliloquy, which the Citizens could not have heard, as they were not present. The
              only reference to Custom made by Coriolanus is contained in his remark in regard to
              &lsquo;the customary gown.&rsquo; Shakespeare's audience had heard Coriolanus
              inveigh against custom and that was all-sufficient.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              course of these notes, of many anachronisms knowingly committed by our Author. I
              cannot help observing that he is guilty of more than one here through an inadvertence
              and desire of copying Plutarch at all hazards. This passage, as Mr Pope rightly
              informs us, is directly translated from that Greek biographer; but I'll tell Mr Pope a
              piece of history, which, I dare say, he was no more aware of than our Author was.
              Plutarch, in the entrance of Coriolanus's life, tracing the origin of the Marcian
              family, blends his account not only with ancestors but the descendants of that great
              man; and Shakespeare in his haste (or perhaps his inacquaintance) with this particular
              point not attending to Plutarch's drift; but, taking all the persons named to be
              Coriolanus's ancestors, has strangely tripped in time, and made his Tribune talk of
              persons and things not then in being. For instance, he is made to talk of Censors. Now
              Coriolanus was killed in the year 266, A. U. C., but no Censors were ever created at
              Rome till 46 years after that period, in the year 312. Again, here is mention not only
              of a Censor, but of Censorinus. Now Caius Marcius Rutulus, when he came a second time
              to that office, on account of the known law propounded by him, was dignified with that
              additional name, in the year 487. But this was not until 220 years after the death of
              Coriolanus. And then again here is mention of the Marcian waters being brought into
              Rome. But we have the positive testimony of Julius Frontinus that they had no
              Aqueducts at Rome till the year 441, and that the Marcian water was not introduced
              till the year 613, so that the Tribunes are made to talk of a fact 347 years later in
              time than the period of Coriolanus. I would not be supposed to found any merit on this
              discovery, much less to be desirous of convicting my Author of such mistakes, but I
              thought it proper to decline a charge of ignorance that might have been laid at my
              door had I passed this affair over in silence. Mr Pope, 'tis plain, tho' he took the
              pains to add the conjectural line about Censorinus, was not aware of this confusion in
              point of chronology, or of our Author's innocent trespass. <hi rend="italic">Non omnia

              and to the confusion between the ancestry and posterity of Coriolanus; he adds:
              &lsquo;Another instance of Shakespeare's inadvertency, from the same cause, we
              have in <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV,</hi> where an account is given of the prisoners
              took on the plains of Holmedon, &ldquo;Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son To
              beaten Douglas,&rdquo; [I, i, 71]. But the Earl of Fife was not son to Douglas,
              but to Robert, Duke of Albany, governor of Scotland. He took his account from
              Holinshed, whose words are: &ldquo;And of prisoners among others were these,
              Mordack, Earl of Fife, son to the governor Arkimbald Earl Douglas,&rdquo; etc. And
              he imagined that the governor and Earl Douglas were one and the same
              person.&rsquo; [This note Warburton did not repeat, or make reference to this
              appearance of it, in his notes on <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV.</hi>&mdash;<hi

              p. 89): Here, indeed, are anachronisms with a witness; for Censorinus and Quintus and
              Publius were descendants, not ancestors, of Coriolanus, and that many generations
              beneath. The source of this mistake of the poet's sprung from too hasty a transcript
              of a passage in his Plutarch. As a drama his play is not much the worse for it; and
              yet it strikes the editor's fancy that he saw the fault while 'twas in making, and
              meant to have mended it; and </p>
            <p>that the gap was a gap in his own copy caus'd by this intention, and not a slip of
              the printer's, as usual.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi> gives the passage
              from Plutarch which was the cause of this confusion; and, without reference to
              Theobald's note, gives the dates of the first Censorship and the introduction of the
              Marcian waters. He thus concludes his note: &lsquo;Can it be supposed that he who
              would disregard such anachronisms, or rather he to whom they were not known, should
              have changed Cato, which he found in his Plutarch, to Calves, from a regard to
              chronology?&rsquo; See I, iv, 82.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verplanck</hi>:
              Shakespeare misunderstood the biographer, and supposed that he meant to give the
              genealogy of his hero, when he intended merely to speak of the illustrious men who had
              at different times sprung from the Marcian family, some before Coriolanus, and the
              last named long after him. Yet it is a singular circumstance, which shows the little
              real value of such minute criticism, that Niebuhr and the modern school of critical
              Roman historians, while they allow the story of Coriolanus to be substantially true,
              yet maintain that he must have lived much later than the date assigned to him by the
              popular histories. If they are correct in this theory, the Poet is accidentally much
              nearer to the chronological truth than many of the learned critics who have been so
              precise in marking the number of years he has gone astray.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Delius</hi>: The &lsquo;darling of the people&rsquo; of
              Pope's addition has but little of the true Shakespearian ring; it is, moreover, not to
              be found in Plutarch, whom Shakespeare is here somewhat closely following, without
              noticing that Plutarch is mentioning not alone ancestors but descendants of
                Coriolanus.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 487, foot-note): The
              addition by Delius seems preferable to the reading of the Cambridge Editors. In the
              first place, it is closer to North, and agrees with Shakespeare's usual practice of
              keeping to North's words so far as possible. In the second place, it is closer to the
              Folio text, involving only the displacement of a comma. In the third place, it is
              simpler to suppose that a whole single line has been missed out than that parts of two
              have been amputated, and the remainders run together.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Collier</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Notes &amp; Emendations,</hi> etc., p. 354):
              Pope's line respecting Censorinus was not wanted, inasmuch as this portion of the
              speech of Brutus was struck out by the old Corrector, possibly, because he saw the
              defect, and was not in a condition to remedy it. Nevertheless, something was at one
              time written in the margin, but it is so erased as not now to be
                legible.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Lettsom</hi> (Walker's <hi rend="italic"
                >Shakespeare's Versification; Preface,</hi> p. xxi.): It is worth observing that
              though Collier's old Corrector has inserted nearly a dozen lines in the text, while
              Walker has pointed out several places where lines appear to be missing, and in some
              instances has attempted to supply the deficiencies, their opinions in this respect
              never coincide. On the passage in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> where Pope has
              inserted the line, &lsquo;And Censorinus darling of the people,&rsquo; they
              are both silent. This is the more to be regretted, as scarcely any supplementary verse
              could be less satisfactory than Pope's. However the lost verse may have begun, it must
              have ended with the words &lsquo;nam'd Censorinus,&rsquo; as is clear from
              what immediately follows.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Singer</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Sh. Vindicated,</hi> etc., p. 216), in reference to the foregoing comment on the
              omission by the MS. Corrector, exclaims: &lsquo;A pretty argument truly! What then
              becomes of his &ldquo;authorities,&rdquo; which we are led to believe he
              consulted on other occasions? I undertake to say that Pope's line is a much more
              judicious addition to the text, as evidently necessary and warranted by the passage in
              Plutarch, than any of the uncalled for interpolations of the correctors so
              triumphantly dwelt upon by Mr </p>

                rend="italic">Der Perkins Folio,</hi> p. 437), on this same head, asks: If the MS.
              Corrector, being aware of this anachronism, struck out this passage, why did he make
              the correction &lsquo;Cato's&rsquo; for <hi rend="italic">Calves,</hi> which
              quite as evidently was an anachronism, or why did he let stand the lines in regard to
              the introduction of the Marcian water?&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">R. G. White</hi>:
              I am responsible for the addition of <hi rend="italic">chosen</hi> to line 260; and in

              presence of the word in the above passage from Plutarch. [Singer, ed. ii., has herein

              &lsquo;by the people.&rsquo; A stain or rent in the copy might have rendered

              443): Perhaps with no other passage in Shakespeare has conjectural emendation taken
              greater liberties; while, as I shall demonstrate, the wholesale emendation is
              altogether unnecessary, emendation is needed, but it consists only of the correction
              of a common misprint and the addition of a single word, the omission of which can be
              easily accounted for. The misprint is &lsquo;so&rsquo; for <hi rend="italic"
                >as.</hi> This &lsquo;so,&rsquo; if I mistake not, was what put Pope and
              others on the wrong scent, backwards instead of forwards. Had they observed the
              punctuation in the Folio (the comma between &lsquo;nam'd&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;so&rsquo;), the misprint would have become self-evident. The word <hi
                rend="italic">Censor</hi> has been omitted from a cause which is often a source of
              mistake&mdash;inattention on the part of the printer to the consecutive repetition
              of the same word. Again the punctuation of the Folio (the comma at the end of the
              line) might have guided the critics aright. As indubitably the true reading I give
              with confidence: And nobly nam'd, <hi rend="italic">as</hi> twice being censor, <hi
                rend="italic">Censor</hi> Was his great ancestor. First we have censor, the official
              title, and then Censor, the abbreviated English form of Censorinus, the honorable name
              conferred on C. Marcius Rutilus, in recognition of the fact that he had held the
              censorship twice. As to the scanning of the line now restored, it is a regular line of
              five accents with an additional syllable. [The title at the head of this paragraph
              runs, &lsquo;The Solution of the Long-standing Crux in
              &ldquo;Coriolanus.&rdquo;&rsquo; Whether this be the author's own, or one
              supplied by the Editor of <hi rend="italic">N. &amp; Q.,</hi> it is, I think, in
              either case injudicious. Modest or deferential introduction of a purely conjectural
              emendation inspires acquiescence, whereas assertion is apt to beget hostility. In
              proof of this it may be said that but two of the subsequent editors or commentators
              (Cholmeley and E. K. Chambers) have shared Spence's &lsquo;confidence&rsquo;
              in this &lsquo;indubitable&rsquo; addition, or have even taken any notice of

              latter show him to be the constant enemy to the people. With reference to I, i, 40, we

              <hi rend="smallcap">E. K. Chambers</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Warwick Sh.</hi>): Act I.
              showed us Coriolanus in his nobility, Act II. in his inherent and fatal weakness. The
              present Act leads him on inevitably to his ruin. At the beginning of it he is the
              champion of Rome, and, as he and the Patricians think, her chosen Consul; at the end
              he is a disgraced exile. His better and his worse qualities have combined to bring
              about this result. If he had had that sympathy with the people which alone can make </p>
            <p>a true leader, or if he had been willing, like the rest of the Senators, to affect a
              sympathy which he did not feel, the crisis of his fate would have been averted. As it
              is, he falls, and we can scarcely pity him. The action of the Act is spread over three
              scenes, dealing respectively with Coriolanus's first defeat by the Tribunes, his
              partial recovery of his position, and his final banishment. This arrangement is
              dramatically effective: it holds the issue in suspense, and thus retains our
                interest.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's
              Sh.</hi>): The Tullus Aufidius element of the tragedy has to be kept &lsquo;in
              being,&rsquo; so that the instrument of the catastrophe may be forthcoming, and
              forthcoming <hi rend="italic">naturally,</hi> when the time comes. It is a sort of
              thread that runs through the play as a parallel but subsidiary interest to the
              Coriolanus element, and the tense irony here (ll. 17-28) is meant to keep the
              connection vividly before us.&mdash;Miss <hi rend="smallcap">C. Porter</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">First Folio Sh.</hi>): Theobald first inserted the stagedirection,
              placing the opening of Act III. in a street. From &lsquo;Passe no
              further&rsquo; (l. 34) it comes out that the Patricians, with Coriolanus, are in
              the act of proceeding toward the <hi rend="italic">Market place</hi> (l. 42). This was
              perhaps the forward part of the fore-stage, and they were at one side of the
              fore-stage, fronting thither, when Brutus and Sicinius from the opposite side enter to
              stop them. As the mutiny grows against Coriolanus he is urged &lsquo;home to thy
              House&rsquo; (l. 287), and thither he goes (at l. 310), passing into the
              rear-stage, now imagined to be his house. Scene ii. follows in the rear-stage, where
              Coriolanus takes his mother's advice and says he is &lsquo;going to the Market
              place&rsquo; (l. 159), and there in the fore-stage scene iii. is placed. With the
              call &lsquo;Go see him out at Gates&rsquo; (iii, 171) the Act ends, all making
              their <hi rend="italic">Exeunt</hi> together in a tumult through the central exit.
              [This reconstruction of the stage-business is certainly plausible, yet it is, I think,
              open to several objections. In the first place, account is not taken of the
              disposition of the stage at the close of Act II. The scene of Coriolanus's ordeal,
              since it requires but little space for the few actors taking part, was doubtless
              played on the fore-stage, the curtains being drawn between the columns, thus cutting
              off the middle and inner stage. Another reason for the use of this fore-stage may be
              found in the fact that both scenes i. and ii. of Act II. are scenes requiring the use
              of the full stage (the triumphal return of Coriolanus and the Senate House). At the
              opening of this Act the curtains between the columns are drawn aside and the full
              stage is made available for the crowded scene of the tumult and mutiny; when
              Coriolanus returns to his house it is more natural for him to make his exit by the
              same door through which he entered instead of through the doorway to the small inner
              stage. At the end of this scene the curtains between the columns are closed after the
              departure of all the participants, and the scene at Coriolanus's house is then played
              on the forestage. The use of the small inner stage for this important scene is hardly
              practical on account of the number of actors taking part. For scene iii, the market
              place again, the curtains are drawn aside and the full stage is used for the final
              scene of the banishment.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              the immediate impression of Coriolanus's having attained his new dignity: that dignity
              striven for in the last Act, assumed and recognised at the commencement of the present
              Act, and forfeited before the conclusion of its first scene. This is just one of the
              poet's touches of dramatic art; with apparent carelessness, but really nicest
              forethought, marking a point which, as the action progresses, is essential to be well

              admits it. Cominius, then, in saying that he had not deserved the rub, could not
              consistently mean to deny the charge which constituted it and to urge that it was

            <p>unsuccessful candidature has, except as it adds to his private irritation, no
              immediate result; and only some time later does his banishment follow on quite another
              occasion. Corn had come from Sicily, and in the dearth it was proposed to distribute
              it gratis; but Marcius inveighed against such a course and urged that the time was
              opportune for the abolition of the Tribunate in a speech which, in the play, he
              &lsquo;speaks again&rsquo; when his election is challenged. But the <hi
                rend="italic">Life</hi> reports it only as delivered in the Senate; and the
              Tribunes, who are present, at once leave and raise a tumult, attempt to arrest him,
              and are resisted. The Senators, to allay the commotion, resolve to sell the corn
              cheap, and thus end the discontent against themselves, but the Tribunes persist in
              their attack on the ringleader, hoping, as we have seen, that he will prove refractory
              and give a handle against himself. When he does this and the death-sentence is
              pronounced, there is still so much feeling of fairness that a legal trial is demanded,
              which the Tribunes consent to grant him, and to which he consents to submit on the
              stipulation that he shall be charged only on the one count of aspiring to make himself
              king. But when the assembly is held the Tribunes break their promise and accuse him of
              seeking to withhold the corn and abolish the Tribunate, and of distributing the spoils
              of the Antiates only among his own followers. . . . So the unexpectedness of this last
              indictment throws him out. Now there are several things to notice in Shakespeare's
              very different version. The first is the tact with which he compresses a great many
              remotely connected incidents into one. He antedates the affair about the corn with
              Marcius's speech against the distribution and the Tribunate, and only brings it in as
              a supplementary circumstance in the prosecution. The real centre of the situation is
              Coriolanus's behaviour when a candidate, and round this all else is grouped; and this
              behaviour, it will be remembered, is altogether a fabrication on Shakespeare's part.

              disease, however, is clearly implied. According to Creighton, a word
              &lsquo;meseles&rsquo; is used in the poem <hi rend="italic">Piers
              Plowman,</hi> meaning <hi rend="italic">lepers,</hi> but John of Gaddesden uses the
              word &lsquo;mesles&rsquo; in his description of &lsquo;morbilli&rsquo;
              (or our presentday measles). Again, &lsquo;Ye Maysilles&rsquo; is given in
              Levins' <hi rend="italic">Manipulus Vocabulorum</hi> as meaning
              &lsquo;Variol&aelig;&rsquo; (our present-day smallpox), and in Baret's

              with manie reddish spottes or speckles in the face and bodie, much like freckles in
              colour.&rsquo; It must be remembered that the confusion was one not merely of
              words and names, but that smallpox (variola) and measles (morbilli) were constantly
              confused, and their distinction was due to the Arabian physician and made known in
              England by John of Gaddesden. We may fairly suppose that &lsquo;meazels&rsquo;

                <hi rend="italic">Love's Labour's,</hi> I, i, 250: &lsquo;there did I see that

              between Triton and Tribune. [Possibly also between &lsquo;Triton of the

              Amphitrite, and Neptune, and the minnows, which are very small fish, is apparent; and
              although it may be truly said that Triton, as a deity of the sea, would rule over the
              minnows with his &lsquo;absolute&rsquo; or peremptory
              &lsquo;shall,&rsquo; which Coriolanus calls &lsquo;the horn and noise of
              the monster,&rsquo; yet, when it is remembered that Triton used to announce the
              approach of Neptune by blowing his horn, which was a large conch or sea-shell, it may
              be considered probable that Shakespeare plays upon the word
              &lsquo;shall&rsquo; in this passage, using it in a double sense; for the words
              &lsquo;shall&rsquo; and <hi rend="italic">shell</hi> do not differ more from
              each other in sound than the words &lsquo;sheep&rsquo; and

              Gentlemen,</hi> I, i, 72, 73; and it may also be considered probable that Shakespeare,
              further on in this passage [ll. 130, 131], plays upon the word
              &lsquo;shall,&rsquo; using it again in a double sense. For the reader will
              perceive that Coriolanus speaks of &lsquo;such a one as he, who puts his <hi

              Greece&rsquo;; and Shakespeare, using the word in a double sense, may refer to the
              practice in ancient Greece of banishing persons considered dangerous to the state by
              ostracism, where the votes were given by shells, each man marking upon his <hi

              <hi rend="smallcap">R. G. White</hi>: The recognition of the compulsory sense of
              &lsquo;shall,&rsquo; and the difference of signification between that
              auxiliary and &lsquo;will&rsquo; could not be more strongly marked than it is
              in the outbreak of the newly chosen Consul against the Tribune's use of the former
              instead of the latter. But upon this point there can hardly be any misunderstanding,
              and need be no remark. No one who is acquainted with our early literature will dispute
              for a moment that very long before the Elizabethan period &lsquo;shall&rsquo;
              emphatically applied by a speaker to a second or third person expressed obligation, or
              that &lsquo;will&rsquo; was used in the same manner, or, again, that
              &lsquo;shall,&rsquo; used with regard to a coming event, had a prophetic
              force, and implied either the ability to bring it about, or the well assured belief
              that it would happen. It is the restriction of &lsquo;shall,&rsquo; in the
              first person, to the expression of simple futurity, and of &lsquo;will&rsquo;
              to that of &lsquo;volition,&rsquo; which is a mark </p>
            <p>of a more modern stage of the language. True, many passages may be produced from
              Shakespeare's own works in which these two auxiliaries are used in exact conformity to
              the modern idiom; but many others occur in which the distinction, now so well
              established, is disregarded. [See also <hi rend="smallcap">Abbott</hi>, &sect;

              power of putting a stop to every proceeding; and, accordingly, Coriolanus, instead of

              calculated to assuage Coriolanus's violence, and the meaning of
              &lsquo;canon&rsquo; in all other places is &lsquo;Divine Law,&rsquo;
              the language of the Ten Commandments. The imperious &lsquo;shall&rsquo;
              Coriolanus might naturally declare belonged to a law with heavenly sanction, not to

              immediate line. As the addition of a single letter restores us this beauty, I make no

              that double antithesis in this and the next line, which Mr Theobald thinks was
              intended, and admires as a beauty, appears, on the contrary, to me to be too studied
              to be the language of passion, which is expressed with much greater spirit by the

              I have given abundant proofs of my attention to it by restoring and establishing many
              ancient readings in every one of these plays, which had been displaced for modern
              innovations; and if in the passage before us the ancient copy had afforded sense I
              should have been very unwilling to disturb it. But it does not; for it reads, not
              &ldquo;O <hi rend="italic">Gods!</hi>&rdquo; as Mr Steevens supposed, but
              &ldquo;O God!&rdquo; an adjuration surely not proper in the mouth of a
              heathen. Add to this that the word &ldquo;but&rdquo; is printed with a small
              initial letter in the only authentic copy; and the words &ldquo;good but
              unwise&rdquo; here appear to be the counterpart of &ldquo;grave and
              reckless&rdquo; in the subsequent line. On a reconsideration of this passage,
              therefore, I am confident that even my learned predecessor will approve of the

              order, which cannot be said of the old one; nor can any good reason be given why one
              Tribune only should be mentioned in the first member of this rhetorical period, and
              both in the last; a further argument in favour of both changes. Transpositions are
              frequent in printing; and the reader will see very signal ones pointed out to him in

                >bounty</hi> for &ldquo;lenity,&rdquo; it is to be observed that Coriolanus
              is here speaking not against the Senate's bounty in letting the people have corn <hi

                rend="italic">lenity,</hi> in letting them have Tribunes as their own special
              magistrates.&rsquo;&mdash;[In his ed. ii. Hudson remarks: &lsquo;I adopt
              Hanmer's reading as the simplest and most satisfactory way of setting both the logic
              and the language in order. Collier's Folio substitutes <hi rend="italic"
              >impotence</hi> for &ldquo;ignorance,&rdquo; and thus gets a fitting
              antithesis to <hi rend="italic">power;</hi> but does nothing towards redressing the
              other difficulties of the passage. &ldquo;Awake your dangerous lenity,&rdquo;
              it seems to me, cannot be made to yield any consistent sense.&rsquo; This last
              statement, in view of Hudson's usual perspicacity, is somewhat surprising. The figure
              is a little involved, but depends upon the meaning of &lsquo;lenity,&rsquo;
              which here is stretched to mean <hi rend="italic">torpor, slothfulness.</hi> It is, in
              fact, practically the same figure as used by Buckingham in his simulated address to
              Richard urging him to take upon himself the royal seat; he says:
              &lsquo;&mdash;the mildness of your sleepy thoughts Which here we waken to our
              country's good&rsquo; (III, vii, 123). In effect Coriolanus says: &lsquo;If
              this officer have no power then arouse your dangerous torpor, and let what was
              inactive become active.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              of your opinions are blended together; that is, are put upon an equal footing, the
              opinions of the Tribunes shall be most relished by the multitude.&rsquo; He calls

              is, the plebeians are no less than senators, when the voices of the senate and the
              people being blended together, the predominant taste of the compound smacks more of
              the populace than the senate.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Whitelaw</hi>:
              &lsquo;The prevailing flavour of the whole smacks rather of their voice (their

              mouth) this dualized government of compromise gives expression to the popular, rather
              than to the patrician, will; the tribunicial nay is stronger than the consular yea.

                Plays,</hi> i, 123): It is with reluctance that I have allowed this passage to stand
              in the text. There can, I suppose, be no doubt as to what the writer meant [Wordsworth
              accepts Wright's explanation]; but surely Horace's Quintilius would have said to such
              a clause, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Corrige, sodes,</hi>&rsquo; and would have
              ordered it to be </p>
            <p>returned to the anvil.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Arden Sh.</hi>): In Malone's explanation &lsquo;palates&rsquo; = savours of
              (of which meaning no other instance has been brought forward), and
              &lsquo;theirs&rsquo; refers to &lsquo;taste&rsquo; and not to
              &lsquo;voices.&rsquo; If &lsquo;palates&rsquo; means <hi rend="italic"
                >relishes,</hi> and &lsquo;theirs&rsquo; refers to
              &lsquo;voices,&rsquo; the sense may be, and they are no less than senators if,
              when they and you mix voices in coming to a decision, the taste of the majority
              prefers your view. In the fact that the metaphor involving taste seems to begin in
              &lsquo;blended,&rsquo; there is an inducement to accept Malone's view,
              although in the only other instances of &lsquo;palate,&rsquo; the verb, in
              Shakespeare (<hi rend="italic">Ant. &amp; Cleo.,</hi> V, ii, 7; <hi rend="italic"
                >Tro. &amp; Cress.,</hi> IV, i, 59) the meanings come under those given in the
                <hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi> (&lsquo;To perceive or try with the palate, to
              taste; to gratify the palate with, to enjoy the taste of, relish&rsquo;), which
              does not give the sense &lsquo;savour of&rsquo; or quote the present passage.
              [This, it will be noted, is substantially the interpretation of Mason; while it is
              doubtless grammatically correct, that of Malone is more in accord with the general
              drift of Coriolanus's fierce invective.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              with their Consuls on the one hand, and the plebeians with their tribunes on the
              other. The Senate, originally merely a consulting body, gradually superseded both. It
              is not hard to see how, when magistracies were annual, knowledge of affairs, and so
              responsibility, and so power, came to lie with a permanent body. And to this both
              patricians and plebeians were eligible by serving certain magistracies. </p>

              that we must understand the word &lsquo;native&rsquo; to denote the native

            <p>quotation from <hi rend="italic">Henry V.</hi> is nothing to the purpose, as in that

              corrections when the source of these is unknown; among the many communicated in
              Collier's first announcement of his discovery &lsquo;there was,&rsquo; says
              Halliwell, &lsquo;scarcely a single example which indicated it was derived from an
              authentic source, but many, on the other hand, which could be well believed to be mere
              guess-work; and it was rather alarming to see the readiness with which they were
              received, threatening the loss of Shakespeare's genuine text. A ray of light, however,
              at length appears in the new reading in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> [the present
              passage]. This, more than any other, gives hopes of important results; and it does
              more than this, it opens a reasonable expectation that the MS. Corrector had, in some
              cases, recollection of the passages as they were delivered in representation. Once

              seems to me to be clearly one of those alterations that no conjectural ingenuity could
              have suggested. The volume has evidently been used for stage purposes; and it may be
              taken as almost beyond a doubt that that particular correction was made on
                authority.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">A. E. Brae</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Notes &amp; Queries,</hi> 10 July, 1852, p. 26): I cannot perceive
              anything in the proposed alteration [<hi rend="italic">bisson multitude</hi>] to exalt
              it above the common herd of conjectural guesses; on the contrary, with the example of
              &lsquo;bisson conspectuities&rsquo; in the same play, nothing appears <hi
                rend="italic">more obvious</hi> than the extension of the same correction to any
              other suspected place to which it might seem applicable. Dealing with it, therefore,
              merely as conjectural, I reject it: (1) Because the apologue of &lsquo;the belly
              and the members,&rsquo; in the first scene, gives its tone to the prevailing
              metaphor throughout the whole play. Hence the frequent recurrence of such images as
              &lsquo;the many-headed multitude,&rsquo; &lsquo;the beast with many
              heads,&rsquo; &lsquo;the horn and noise of the monster,&rsquo;
              &lsquo;the <hi rend="italic">tongues</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">common
              mouth,</hi>&rsquo; &amp;c.; and hence the strong probability that in any given
              place the same metaphor will prevail. (2) Because in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>
              there are three several expressions having a remarkable resemblance in common, viz.,
              &lsquo;multiplying spawn,&rsquo; &lsquo;multitudinous tongue,&rsquo;
              &lsquo;bosom multiplied,&rsquo; and the concurrence of these three is strongly
              presumptive of the authenticity of any one of them. (3) Because in the speech wherein
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">bosom multiplied</hi>&rsquo; occurs&mdash;the
              matter in discussion being the policy of having given corn to the people <hi
                rend="italic">gratis</hi>&mdash;when Coriolanus exclaims, &lsquo;Whoever
              gave that counsel, <hi rend="italic">nourished</hi> disobedience, <hi rend="italic"
                >fed</hi> the ruin of the state&rsquo;; these two words, of themselves, seem
              intended to be metaphorical to the subject; but when he goes on to enquire,
              &lsquo;how shall this bosom multiplied <hi rend="italic">digest</hi> the senate's
              courtesy,&rsquo; it becomes manifest that &lsquo;digest&rsquo; continues
              the metaphor which &lsquo;nourished&rsquo; and &lsquo;fed&rsquo; had
              begun, and if, in addition, it can be shown that &lsquo;bosom&rsquo; was
              commonly used as <hi rend="italic">the seat of digestion,</hi> then the inference
              appears to be irresistible that &lsquo;bosom multiplied&rsquo; is a phrase
              expressly introduced <hi rend="italic">to complete the metaphor.</hi> Now, that <hi
                rend="italic">bosom</hi> was so used, and by Shakespeare, is easily proved. Here is
              one example from <hi rend="italic">2 Henry IV:</hi> &lsquo;Thou beastly feeder . .
              . disgorge thy glutton bosom,&rsquo; I, iii, 98. But I shall go still further: I
              assert that Shakespeare has nowhere used <hi rend="italic">digest</hi> in the purely
              mental sense; that is, without some reference real or figurative, to the animal
              function of the stomach. . . . (4) Because, since digest is thus invariably used by
              Shakespeare, &lsquo;bosom multiplied,&rsquo; having close relation with that
              function, is in strict analogy with the prevailing metaphor of the play; while, on the
              other hand, <hi rend="italic">bisson multitude</hi> has no relation with it at all;
              and therefore, had the latter been the genuine expression, it would have been
              associated not with &lsquo;digest,&rsquo; but with some verb bearing more
              reference to the function of sight than to that of deglutition or concoction. (5)
              Because I cannot perceive why there should be any greater difficulty in the
              metaphorical allusion to <hi rend="italic">the bosom multiplied digesting the senate's
                courtesy</hi> than to <hi rend="italic">the multitudinous tongue licking the sweet
                which is their poison.</hi> There is, in fact, such a close metaphorical allusion
              between the two expressions that one can scarcely be doubted as long as the other is
              received as genuine.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Singer</hi> (<hi rend="italic"

              objection offers itself: the context requires a plural noun to be in accord with

              &ldquo;this bosome multiplied&rdquo; cannot be right; for dare we say the poet

              believe it possible that Mr Singer could have overlooked the parallel metaphor to
              which I directed attention in the fifth clause of my original argument; and yet in
              that metaphor the very same peculiarity of expression (which Mr Singer is pleased to
              call <hi rend="italic">error</hi>) is much more prominent, viz.: &lsquo;At once
              pluck out The multitudinous tongue, let <hi rend="italic">them</hi> not lick The sweet
              which is their poison.&rsquo; This passage is, I presume, of undoubted
              genuineness; and yet in it <hi rend="italic">them</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
              >their</hi> are in much closer apparent connection with the singular noun than in the
              clause objected to; consequently, with such a palpable example within a few lines of a
              repetition of the very difficulty he was animadverting upon, I cannot conceive how Mr
              Singer could indulge in the vein he has respecting it. But the truth is that no real
              difficulty exists at all; because it is quite plain that the <hi rend="italic"
                >dominant antecedent</hi> throughout the whole speech to such words as <hi

              Collier's volume with a large number of the MS. corrections appeared in the following

              hesitation <hi rend="italic">bisson multitude,</hi> the reading of Collier's Folio. By
              &lsquo;bosom-multiplied&rsquo; the poet means the union or complex of the
              bosoms, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> the hearts, affections, of the people. In his
              next speech Coriolanus uses in a similar manner &lsquo;multitudinous

              some justification. With [&lsquo;bosom multiplied,&rsquo; meaning <hi
                rend="italic">bosom of the people,</hi>] may be compared <hi rend="italic"
              >Lear,</hi> V, iii, 49. And still better, as preserving the figure made use of here,
              to which the word &lsquo;digest&rsquo; points, <hi rend="italic">2 Henry

              &lsquo;Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the

                >Falcon Sh.</hi>), in defence of the Folio reading, and in reference to the passage
              from <hi rend="italic">2 Henry IV:</hi> I, iii, remarks that &lsquo;if a bosom
              could disgorge, it could digest.&rsquo;&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap"
              >Perring</hi> (p. 298): The critics convert &lsquo;this bosom
              multiplied&rsquo;&mdash;by what process I know not&mdash;to
              &lsquo;this bissom multitude!&rsquo; The latter being the harsher expression,
              is thought perhaps to accord better with Coriolanus's temper. As a matter of fact,
              however, for this particular passage the other phrase bears off the palm. It is not
              the blindness of the multitude which is here glanced at, but the dangerous knowledge
              bosomed up by them and sure in time to be thoroughly digested, that they had wrung
              gratuities and concessions from a reluctant oligarchy. Multiply the bosom, and you
              augment the danger. <hi rend="italic">Bissom multitude</hi> is just the phrase that an
              unwary critic would catch at; and how triumphantly might he point to &lsquo;bissom
              conspectuities&rsquo; in another part of the play! But &lsquo;bosom
              multiplied&rsquo; is the phrase for the place, original, unique, and strikingly
              apposite, bearing the stamp of discerning judgment and originating genius. It may be
              matched with the &lsquo;multitudinous tongue&rsquo; which occurs a little
              further down; only there <hi rend="italic">speech,</hi> here <hi rend="italic"
                >thought,</hi> is the dominant idea. By all means read, therefore, &lsquo;How
              shall this bosom multiplied digest The Senate's courtesy.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">G. S. Gordon</hi>: There is no reason to change &lsquo;bosom
              multiplied&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">bisson multitude.</hi> It is a poor
              argument for <hi rend="italic">bisson</hi> (purblind) that it has already occurred in
              II, i, 59. And we do not digest with our eyes. But can a bosom digest? No; but it is
              the bosom which first feels the load of repletion and indigestion. Had Shakespeare's
              idea been simply digestion he would have used <hi rend="italic">belly.</hi> It is
              because the courtesy-crammed multitude <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> digest, can
              indeed do nothing more than gorge what the senate gives it, that he uses
              &lsquo;bosom.&rsquo; This is confirmed by the only other passages in
              Shakespeare where &lsquo;bosom&rsquo; occurs in this connexion. They are <hi
                rend="italic">2 Henry IV:</hi> I, iii, 95-98, and <hi rend="italic">Macbeth,</hi> V,
              iii, 44. In both of these passages, as in ours, the bosom suffers from repletion, and
              is the seat not of digestion, but of indigestion. The first is a striking parallel in
              more than language; that &lsquo;beastly feeder,&rsquo; the insatiate
              multitude, is precisely the subject of Coriolanus's thoughts. The second is a
              description of ordinary dyspepsia. Editors have been accustomed to defend </p>
            <p>&lsquo;bosom&rsquo; in our passage by saying that a bosom which disgorges (as
              in <hi rend="italic">2 Henry IV.</hi>) must be able to digest. This is smart and
              lawyer-like, nothing more.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Arden Sh.</hi>) retains the reading of the Folio, accepting Malone's interpretation
              and quoting in support of the text <hi rend="italic">Lear,</hi> V, iii, 49, and l. 185
              below, and in conclusion says: &lsquo;But though some editors read
              &ldquo;bisson <hi rend="italic">multitude,</hi>&rdquo; such a violent change
              is out of the question in view of the sense yielded by the old reading and the support
              it receives from the above references, and the many uses of
              &ldquo;bosom&rdquo; by Shakespeare.&rsquo; On the meaning of
              &lsquo;digest,&rsquo; as here used, Case remarks: &lsquo;That is, <hi
                rend="italic">interpret, understand.</hi> Beeching's argument is fallacious, for, in
              reality, there is no <hi rend="italic">if</hi> about it; rejected food must pass
              through the breast, which can, therefore, disgorge, but not digest. Figuratively,
              however, the bosom, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> the heart or mind, can digest in the
              sense of thinking out, reaching understanding by a slow process resembling digestion,
              and &ldquo;understand&rdquo; is the ultimate sense required here. The same
              would follow from G. S. Gordon's different reasoning. . . . But it may be doubted
              whether Shakespeare distinguished as carefully as the commentator.&rsquo; </p>

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Warburton</hi>: This is so like Polonius's eloquence, and so much
              unlike the rest of Coriolanus's language, that I am apt to think it
                spurious.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Heath</hi> (p. 420): &lsquo;Purpose so
              barr'd&rsquo; is only the same thing, recapitulated in three words, which had been
              before expressed more at large in ll. 173-175. Wherever this is done, Coriolanus
              concludes, nothing is done to purpose. If Mr Warburton had given himself the leisure
              to understand this, I suppose he would scarce have disgraced this passage,
              notwithstanding a play on the words not unusual to Shakespeare, by comparing it to
              Polonius his eloquence, or rejected it as spurious.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Badham</hi> (p. 7): The sense and metre in this passage alike indicate that it is
              corrupt; for to what does senatorial wisdom have recourse when its wiser purposes are
              barred their execution by popular ignorance? not slightness&mdash;though
              slightness will certainly be the quality of whatever fabric they rear, but <hi

              there can be no successful policy; all is from hand to mouth and unsatisfactory. There
              is, I think, a personal note in this passage which suggests that it expresses
              Shakespeare's own indictment of democracy. Want of continuity of policy has ever been
              the characteristic weakness of popular government. </p>

            <p>preservation of those, you overlook the danger the constitution incurs by strictly
              adhering to them. This the speaker, in vindication of his conduct, artfully represents
              to be his case; yet this pertinent observation the Oxford Editor [Hanmer], with one
              happy dash of his pen, in amending &lsquo;doubt&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic"
                >do,</hi> entirely abolishes.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Heath</hi> (p. 420):
              That is, You whose love for the fundamental part of the state (or, which in the
              language and sentiments of Coriolanus amounts to the same thing, the supreme authority
              of the Senate) is not overpowered by your apprehensions, that the steps necessary to
              support it may possibly hazard the change of it. That this is the sense of the passage
              is evident from what immediately precedes and follows it (l. 179 and ll. 181-184). All
              which lines express the very same sentiment under various illustrations. Instead of
              this, Mr Warburton hath given us a sense which the words do by no means express, and
              which counteracts the very scope and intention of the speaker; a sense which
              insinuates that it is more prudent to yield in points of form than hazard the safety
              of the constitution. Whereas the advice of Coriolanus is, That it is better to put the
              whole to the hazard at once than to temporize, while the authority of the Senate is
              thus gradually subverted.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Johnson</hi>: To
              &lsquo;doubt&rsquo; is to <hi rend="italic">fear.</hi> The meaning is:
              &lsquo;You whose zeal predominates over your terrors; you who do not fear so much
              the danger of violent measures, as wish the good to which they are necessary, the
              preservation of the original constitution of our government.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi

              &lsquo;The fundamental part of state&rsquo; is, in the speaker's estimation,
              that government which subsisted before the people had any great share in it, and
              especially before the institution of tribunes; whom he would have them set aside and
              fear no consequences, reverting to a rule by themselves; assigning for cause of his
              advice their present <hi rend="italic">dishonourable</hi> dependence, which hinder'd
              them from doing anything rightly, or the state any service, while the tribunes had a
                <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> in everything. This short gloss conveys a true idea of
              the tendency of all this long speech, some part of which is wrapped up in a purposed
              obscurity, the speaker being more set on fire; in his next he is more
                open.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi> takes objection to the first part of
              Johnson's paraphrase on the ground that &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">zeal</hi> is not
                <hi rend="italic">discretion.</hi>&rsquo; He thus interprets: &lsquo;You
              that will show less fear than prudence (or foresight), <hi rend="italic">or</hi> that
              will rather be prudent (or foreseeing) than afraid.&rsquo; And continues:
              &lsquo;&ldquo;Violent measures,&rdquo; as advocated in lines 183 <hi
                rend="italic">et seq.,</hi> may affect &ldquo;the state,&rdquo; as
              Coriolanus wishes, by their success, or &ldquo;the fundamental part of
              state,&rdquo; as he does not wish, by their failure. In the one case, change is
              the action of the senators (and = changing) and &ldquo;on't&rdquo; refers to
              &ldquo;state&rdquo; only; in the other, change is the result of the failure of
              that action and &ldquo;on't&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;the fundamental part
              of state.&rdquo; The two senses (which, after all, are involved in Johnson's
              expression, &ldquo;the danger of violent measures&rdquo;) could be put in this
              way: (a) You that fear not to change the constitution in order to preserve its
              foundations; (b) You that so love the fundamental part of state that you will risk it
              to make it sure. The fundamental part of the state is affected in Coriolanus's eyes
              already, but there is room for greater loss, so that this cannot be urged against (b),
              which has also a correspondence with the alternatives that follow in ll.

              to <hi rend="italic">jolt,</hi> to give a rude concussion to anything. &lsquo;To
              jump a body&rsquo; may, therefore, mean &lsquo;to put it into a violent
              agitation or commotion.&rsquo; Thus Lucretius, III, 452&mdash; <hi
                rend="italic">quassatum est corpus.</hi> [This assertion by Steevens, without any
              example to support it, is not borne out by fact. The <hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi>
              does not give any such transitive meaning to the verb <hi rend="italic">jump;</hi> his
              quotation from Lucretius is nothing to the purpose; <hi rend="italic">quassatum</hi>
              is used tropically for <hi rend="italic">enfeebled, weakened.</hi>&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] So in Phil. Holland's translation of Pliny's <hi

                rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> restore or increase its power. This term from falconry was
              familiar to the poet.&mdash;[In his <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare Vindicated</hi>
              (published a year later) Singer repeats this emendation, remarking of the word
              &lsquo;jump&rsquo; that &lsquo;all attempts to give it a reasonable
              meaning have failed&rsquo; and &lsquo;nothing can be made of it.&rsquo; In
              illustration of Shakespeare's use of the word <hi rend="italic">imp</hi> as a term of
              falconry, used metaphorically, Singer quotes, &lsquo;Impe out our country's broken
              wing,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Richard II:</hi> II, i, 292, and thus concludes:
              &lsquo;The word originally signified to insert, and, in falconry, to insert a
              feather into an injured or deficient wing of a hawk; but its general meaning is to
              mend by artificial means; this is the sense required here&mdash;to patch
              up.&rsquo; Thus, in <hi rend="italic">The Pilgrim,</hi> Beaumont and Fletcher, I,
              i, &lsquo;None of your pieced companions, pined gallants That fly to flitters,
              with every flaw of weather; None of your imped
              bravadoes.&rsquo;&mdash;Singer's statement, that the general meaning of <hi
                rend="italic">imp</hi> &lsquo;is to mend by artificial means&rsquo; and
              hence &lsquo;to patch up,&rsquo; is only partly correct. The original meaning
              is <hi rend="italic">to engraft,</hi> from the Greek <hi rend="italic">emphenein,</hi>
              to implant; Shakespeare was undoubtedly familiar with the term in falconry, and
              certainly understood it sufficiently to preclude his using it in connection with a
              dose of physic. Medicine is not used to patch up a sickened body; but may often be
              used, as Malone says, even at the risk, or hazard, of a cure. The Anonymous writer in
                <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</hi> (Sep., 1853, p. 322), who reviews
              Collier's MS. Corrections, turns aside for a moment to speak with special commendation
              of this emendation by Singer; but, misled by him, also asserts that &lsquo;there
              is an old word <hi rend="italic">imp,</hi> which signifies to patch,&rsquo; and,
              since no sense can be made of the words &lsquo;to jump a body,&rsquo; <hi
                rend="italic">imp</hi> &lsquo;is the word which ought to stand in the

                rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi> (ed. i.): Malone's explanation of this rank corruption

                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">va</hi>&rsquo; was more likely to have been

              &lsquo;Jump&rsquo; was quite surely used of old substantively in the sense of

              so singular in itself, and so infelicitous in the present passage, that I more than
              suspect corruption. Yet I cannot accept either Mr Singer's &lsquo;To <hi

              but consulted the <hi rend="italic">Variorum</hi> of 1821 he would there have seen
              that &lsquo;jump&rsquo; used as a verb transitively was not as singular as he
              thought; also that <hi rend="italic">vamp</hi> is not Dyce's emendation, but due to an
              earlier editor.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Hudson</hi> (ed. i.) quotes the passages given by Steevens and Malone in support of
              the Folio text meaning <hi rend="italic">to risk</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
              >hazard.</hi> He admits that he was at first inclined to adopt Singer's emendation,
              and of that editor's remark that nothing can be made of the original reading Hudson
              says: &lsquo;Mr Singer is entitled to more respect than he sometimes shows towards
              others who are not less worthy of it than himself. As explained and confirmed by our
              quotations, to <hi rend="italic">jump</hi> a body is just the very thing that would
              needs be done by using <hi rend="italic">dangerous physic;</hi> nor is anything more
              natural or more common than to use such physic in cases where the patient is
              &ldquo;sure of death without it.&rdquo; In other words, the sense of risk
              agrees much better with the context here than that of <hi rend="italic"
                >mend.</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">C. &amp; M. Cowden
              Clarke</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi>): The original word
              &lsquo;jump&rsquo; is used elsewhere by Shakespeare to express the precise
              meaning demanded here&mdash; &lsquo;risk,&rsquo;
              &lsquo;hazard,&rsquo; &lsquo;jeopardise.&rsquo; [The passages from <hi

                rend="italic">Pliny</hi> are given.] The argument throughout the passage, as well as
              the sentence in immediate juxtaposition, require that the original word, signifying
              &lsquo;risk,&rsquo; should be retained, and not altered to one that means
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">patch up by attempted
                cure.</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Bailey</hi> (i, 164): If we
              discard &lsquo;jump&rsquo; we want a word in its place which will help to
              express this, and not differ from it too much in point of sound. Of all the terms I
              can think of, <hi rend="italic">tempt</hi> is the one that accomplishes the desired
              end the best: &lsquo;To tempt a body,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> to
              try a body, to make an experiment upon it. So <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII:</hi> I,

              [l. 55].&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Leo</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>):
              Neither &lsquo;vamp&rsquo; nor &lsquo;imp&rsquo; express what
              Coriolanus means; he will treat the body with a dangerous physic, and hopes to
              &lsquo;cure,&rsquo; not to &lsquo;vamp&rsquo; it, and since the
              treatment is dangerous, he <hi rend="italic">jumps,</hi> i. e., he risks the
                body.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi>: That is, to run the risk of
              applying a dangerous remedy to a body. There is no actually parallel instance in
              Shakespeare of &lsquo;jump&rsquo; in this sense, but the following may be
              compared: <hi rend="italic">Macbeth,</hi> I, vii, 7, and <hi rend="italic"
              >Cymbeline,</hi> V, iv, 188. The difference is, of course, that in these cases the
              object of the verb is not that which is put in peril. [Wright quotes the passage from
              Holland's <hi rend="italic">Pliny</hi> as &lsquo;very much to the purpose, but

              argue with the people about the prudence of their conduct. The editors continue this
              change in the persons to whom the speeches are assigned, without the slightest regard,
              as it appears to us, to the exquisite characterisation of the poet. Amidst all this

              &lsquo;No, I'll die here.&rsquo; He again continues silent; but the modern
              editors must have him talking; and so they put in his mouth the calculating sentence,

              characteristic talking of Menenius, &lsquo;I would they were

              speech is not at all characteristic of Coriolanus; and the observation of the Tribune
              refers to what he had previously spoken, &lsquo;Marcius would have all from

              modern editors, Menenius, the peacemaker, is made to call his countrymen barbarians,
              and after abusing them, to tell Coriolanus, who has been perfectly <hi rend="italic"
                >silent,</hi> &lsquo;not to put his worthy rage into his tongue,&rsquo; to
              offer to fight the Tribunes (which clearly belongs, as well as what follows, to
              Cominius), and, in pleading for his friend, to admit that he is a mortified limb

              error; but that is not sufficient reason for modern editors to give ll. 292-294 to
              Coriolanus instead of Menenius as in the Folio. There the speech of Menenius continues
              down to &lsquo;another,&rsquo; l. 296, but evidently with the words
              &lsquo;Begone,&rsquo; etc., another interlocutor is introduced, who can be no
              other than Cominius. The admonition thus appropriately applies to Menenius, who is

              themselves of so able a champion. Mr Theobald objects, that hereby the climax, which
              seems evidently designed, is destroyed. I can see no climax even in his emendation,

              &lsquo;To banish him from hence were but to encounter one danger; and to allow him
              to remain in Rome would be to encounter another&mdash;the certain destruction of
              our offices as tribunes.&rsquo; We think the word <hi rend="italic">another</hi>
              is ellipitically understood after &lsquo;here,&rsquo; as thus: &lsquo;To

              be the true reading, it must mean one all-pervading constant source of

              we must accept the Cowden Clarkes' explanation. Perhaps it would be better to read
              (with Theobald) &lsquo;our danger.&rsquo; The Cambridge Edd. conjecture
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">moe</hi> danger&rsquo;; but <hi rend="italic"
              >moe</hi> (as one of these editors has himself elsewhere noted) is used only with a
              plural or a collective noun.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">T. Page</hi>: That is,
              Would be nothing but one all-absorbing cause of danger. Compare <hi rend="italic"
                >Macbeth,</hi> II, ii, 63. Theobald's conjecture of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> for
              &lsquo;one&rsquo; is highly probable.&mdash;[The majority of commentators
              are in favor of the interpretation of &lsquo;one&rsquo; here in the sense <hi
                rend="italic">constant, perpetual,</hi> though just how the expulsion of Coriolanus
              would be a continual danger is not made evident. This interpretation, moreover,
              renders the rest of Sicinius's remarks meaningless, or without the needed antithesis.
              I am therefore inclined to think the explanation by the Cowden Clarkes is the more
              rational: To expel this traitor is only one danger; to let him remain is a double
              danger&mdash;our destruction. The one danger being, as Heath interprets, the loss
              of such a champion. The adversitive &lsquo;but&rsquo; is also against the
              meaning <hi rend="italic">constant.</hi> Sicinius would hardly say, The expulsion of
              this traitor is only a continuous danger, as an antithesis to the destruction of the
              Tribunate. One is almost as </p>
            <p>bad as the other. I agree with Heath; Theobald's emendation is quite

              p. 91): This, at first blush, appears no proper speech for Menenius; and accordingly
              the two latter editors have proceeded to take it away from him, and give it to
              Sicinius; not reflecting that this seemingly opposite topic with which he sets out
              might be so winded about by Menenius that the argument might turn out for his purpose,
              was he suffer'd to finish it; the topic is the same he had us'd in the speech before
              this, ll. 363, 364; and his intention seems to have been to enforce it again in this,
              and set it in a different light, and in one that was stronger. [W. A. Wright gives
              substantially the same reason for rejecting Warburton's change of speakers as that by
              Capell. That this speech belongs to one on the side of Coriolanus is shown by the next
              words of Brutus, &lsquo;We'll hear no more,&rsquo; etc., which would hardly be
              addressed to his fellow Tribune.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: You allege, says Menenius, that being diseased he must
              be cut away. According then to your </p>
            <p>argument the foot, being once gangrened, is not to be respected for what it was
              before it was gangrened.&mdash;&lsquo;Is this just?&rsquo; Menenius would
              have added, if the Tribune had not interrupted him; and indeed, without any such
              addition, from his state of the argument these words are understood.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Lettsom</hi> (ap. <hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi>, ii.): This speech
              is part of the preceding one of Brutus. The next speech (&lsquo;We'll hear no
              more,&rsquo; &amp;c.) I should say belongs to Sicinius.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">C. &amp; M. Cowden Clarke</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
              >Shakespeare</hi>): Warburton assigned this speech to Sicinius, but it is a following
              up of Menenius's previous speech and argument. By adopting Steevens's interrogation
              point placed at its conclusion the consecution is not only rendered obvious, but the
              same interrogatory form is kept up as in the line, &lsquo;What has he done to Rome
              that's worthy death?&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi> (ed. ii.):
              Here Menenius is probably to be understood as urging the logical consequences of the
              Tribune's position by way of refuting it . . . I can hardly think the Poet would have
              put into the mouth of either Tribune an argument so palpably unjust.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's Sh.</hi>): Grammatically
              the verb &lsquo;is&rsquo; has no subject, for the sense prevents
              &lsquo;service&rsquo; being so taken, but it is easily supplied from
              &lsquo;foot&rsquo; in l. 375. The simplest change is Theobald's proposal,
              viz., to read <hi rend="italic">is't</hi> and treat the remark as a sarcastic
              question. The speakers are, however, all somewhat stirred, and a touch of verbal
              irregularity seems to fit the context.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>): Ellipse confuses the grammar and the precise sense,
              but whether it is the foot or the service of the foot that is no longer regarded when
              the disease of the one terminates the other, signifies little. Either [Warburton's or
              Lettson's] change is possible, for Brutus in effect says: when he loved his country it
              honoured him, not now; and he or Sicinius would continue: when the foot serves it is
              regarded, not when mortification has set in, inferring that it must then be cut away,
              as Sicinius said in l. 362. In Menenius's mouth the speech is bitterly ironical and
              recurs to l. 363, but there is this inconsistency in the metaphor, that &lsquo;a
              limb that has but a disease; Mortal to cut it off,&rsquo; is now a limb that has a
              disease; mortal not to cut it off. </p>

              398 is well worth attention, as showing those faults which transposition alone
              remedies. The most natural, I should almost say, the only way of accounting for such a
              blunder is to suppose that the person who dictated the passage to a transcriber,
              having reached the end of one line, skipt the next, and proceeded with the third, and
              then, upon discovering his mistake, went back to the omitted line, and continued to
              dictate without ordering an erasure. Afterwards it would often happen that when the
              redundancy was discovered by a careless or unlearned person the erasure would be made
              in the wrong place. It is to this cause of transcribing from dictation that we must
              also attribute the endless confusions of metre by the ignorant divisions of the lines,
              which some of our modern editors have so religiously restored. Anyone who makes such a
              remark must prepare himself for the taunt that he counts the verses upon his fingers.
              As Shakespeare wrote in numbers, and as numbers are intended to be counted, it
              certainly seems wiser, in case of a deficient ear, to count upon our fingers than not
              to count at all. I am very far from approving of Sir Thomas Hanmer's or Steevens's
              practice, of making emendations to suit the metre; but there is surely a wise middle
              course to be observed between retaining what amends itself, or defending what is
              incurable, and attempting to reproduce that of which there are no vestiges to guide
              us. [My own complete agreement with the concluding portion of the

              out one point of difference between the characters of Volumnia and Coriolanus: her
              specious argument evokes no response, and she is reduced to the sheer personal appeal,
              edged with reproach and the hint of her own sufferings. By the close she has played on
              every note.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Falcon

              unwillingness on Coriolanus's part to defend himself. Such unwillingness is, however,
              dramatically consistent with Shakespeare's conception of the character. </p>

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi> has, on this line, contributed a long note to the
              effect that neither of these punishments was known at Rome, following this with
              speculations as to how Shakespeare might have become acquainted with the latter form
              of death for traitors. On the question of its being known to the Romans Malone quotes
              from Virgil, <hi rend="italic">&AElig;neid,</hi> viii, 642-645, a reference to the
              death of Mettius Suffetius, and from Livy, I, ch. xxviii, where the same incident is
              recorded with details as to the rending apart of Mettius by horses harnessed to
              chariots. As Malone remarks, since Shakespeare mentions death on the wheel, which was
              certainly unknown to the Romans, it is highly improbable that he knew anything about
              the fate of Mettius; he suggests, however, that: &lsquo;Shakespeare had probably
              read or heard in his youth that Balthazar Gerard, who assassinated William Prince of
              Orange in 1584, was torn to pieces by wild horses; as Nicholas de Salvedo had been not
              long before, for conspiring to take away the life of that prince.&rsquo; Malone
              also refers to the infliction of this same punishment upon John Chastel in 1594 for
              his attempt on the life of <hi rend="italic">Henri IV.</hi>&mdash; <hi

              as violating historic accuracy, say: &lsquo;With almost as much justice might it
              be gravely objected that to &ldquo;pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock&rdquo;
              was never known to be done in Rome as a means of punishing by death. For poetic and
              dramatic purpose Shakespeare putting these words into Coriolanus's mouth has a truth
              of appropriateness far beyond that demanded by the accuracies of chronological

              apply equally well or better to the different punishment inflicted, for example, upon
              Brunhault (or Brunhilda) in 613, under Clotaire II, who was put to death by being
              dragged at the heels of a wild horse. See Beard, <hi rend="italic">The Theatre of

              so to bee left to his mercy to bee drawen miserably to her destruction; which was no
              sooner executed, but her miserable carkasse (the instrument of so many mischiefes) was
              with mens feet spurned, bruised, trampled, and wounded after a most strange fashion;
              and this was the wofull end of miserable <hi rend="italic">Brunchild.</hi>&rsquo;

              room is left for doubt that we have here the main source of Shakespeare's reference.
              Either of the quotations from Beard's volume are, to my mind, much more likely sources

              Can any critic produce a passage from Shakespeare to justify such an expression as
              this? or if he could, shall we believe that the Patrician is intended to encourage him
              in his contumacy? If so, why does Coriolanus bring in the mention of his mother, and
              justify himself, as he is here made to do, by her example? And then what a gross
              contradiction to the general economy of the play, that Coriolanus whose respect for
              his mother is stronger than his ambition or his revenge,&mdash;who is to him the
              single object of his deepest passion, family pride,&mdash;should talk <hi

            <p>and a pretty character he gives of her. She, a high born, calls the plebeians by the
              vilest names; as if the coarseness, which political animosity barely excuses in a man,
              was becoming in a Roman matron. And then observe how the ingenious editors distort the
              plain meaning of words. &lsquo;I muse&rsquo; is <hi rend="italic">I
              think,</hi> but here, forsooth, it <hi rend="italic">must mean</hi> I wonder. The
              truth is, Volumnia does not enter until the words &lsquo;I talk of you,&rsquo;
              as the very words declare; for had she been on the scene that information would have
              been superfluous. But Volumnia's name was there, no doubt, and the nearest
              approximation to the original passage which we have to offer is this: <hi rend="bq">
                &lsquo;Yet will I still<lb rend="RIGHT"/> Be thus to them.<lb/>

            <p>[Ten years later Badham, in his Essay on the <hi rend="italic">Text of
              Shakespeare</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Cambridge Essays,</hi> p. 278), returns to this
              passage, not having, in the meantime, discovered any satisfactory explanation of the
              line &lsquo;You do the nobler.&rsquo; He remarks: &lsquo;I am very sure
              that Shakespeare himself would not have understood it; but, even supposing that it
              means something, it cannot mean anything which can suggest to Coriolanus's mind the
              reflection about his mother.&rsquo;&mdash;Since the issuance of Badham's
              earlier work Collier's publication of his MS. annotator's notes had appeared, wherein
              was a corroboration of Badham's conjecture as to the proper placing of the entrance of
              Volumnia. Badham makes, however, no reference to his having been thus anticipated, but
              cites the MS. correction as a proof of her later entrance, and thus continues:
              &lsquo;If the appearance of Volumnia did not first bring her to Coriolanus's mind,
              something else must have done so, as it is plainly repugnant to all dramatic propriety
              that such a subject should be introduced by an abrupt reminiscence. Now the only thing
              that could have suggested the thought of his mother must be the previous mention of
              her name in the speech of the Patrician. When this was corrupted, the word Volumnia
              remained as if it had been a stagedirection, and the rest was omitted.&rsquo;
              Badham's conjectural restoration of the whole passage as it must have stood before
              corruption is, with but slight change, similar to that given in his earlier work;
              instead of &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">wrong in this</hi>&rsquo; he substitutes
                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">wrong herein</hi>&rsquo;<hi rend="italic">;</hi>
              and, commendably, omits any mention of Coriolanus's <hi rend="italic">father</hi> in

              (ed. ii.): Dr Badham thinks that there is a considerable hiatus here&mdash;which I
              doubt. The Patrician is commending Coriolanus's obstinate determination to stand out
              against the plebs. </p>

              here shows Shakespeare's intention to convey the circumstance that the garment worn by

              &lsquo;woolvish&rsquo; as given in our note on II, iii, 115. At the same time
              the epithet &lsquo;vassals&rsquo; affords confirmation to our surmise that <hi

              judges, a matter of suspicion. I will freely confess that the line of eight syllables
              occurs so often in Shakespeare that in any less corrupt text it would be ridiculous to
              retain the least misgiving about it; but to my ear, at least, it sounds as
              unrhythmically abrupt as the dramatic Alexandrine is abrupt and yet rhythmical, or as
              the six-syllable line is well suited to an harmonious pause; but in the passage before
              us, if there is any meaning, it is at least very obscurely expressed; I venture,

              had you but shown yourself less like yourself, and like the man you played, if, etc.
              This is intelligible, and yet editors have conjectured about the passage, and almost
              unanimously adopted Theobald's correction. The plural
              &lsquo;dispositions&rsquo; is favorable (if not quite conclusive) for the
              Folio reading, besides the fact that &lsquo;them&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;they&rsquo; according to the new reading have no expressed connection.
              Furthermore, the tone of the speech, which through the remark that the despised
              Plebeians, the things, could equally extol their manhood, retains its pointed
                character.&mdash;[<hi rend="smallcap">Leo</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Jahrbuch,</hi>
              xv, 1880, p. 52), in a review of Schmidt's edition of this play, singles out the
              foregoing note for special notice. He refuses to accept the three passages cited by
              Schmidt as proof that the word &lsquo;things&rsquo; is necessarily used by
              Shakespeare in a technical sense for the Plebeians. These passages are: &lsquo;a
              thing of blood,&rsquo; where Cominius thus speaks of Coriolanus; &lsquo;hence
              rotten thing,&rsquo; where Coriolanus thus addresses Sicinius; and
              &lsquo;woolen vassals, things created,&rsquo; etc. In these two latter
              examples Leo points out that &lsquo;things&rsquo; is not a contemptuous
              epithet, so much as a term equivalent to <hi rend="italic">creature.</hi> Leo, in
              fact, does not agree to any one of Schmidt's arguments in favor of the intelligibility
              of the Folio reading. As this is, however, but an interpretation of another's
              interpretation and not an elucidation of Shakespeare's text I have refrained from a
              more detailed transcribing of Leo's remarks. He concludes with a question for
              consideration as to whether with the word <hi rend="italic">thwartings</hi> the
              adjective &lsquo;lesser&rsquo; is not the more appropriate, while with

              The line in Italics is written in a blank space, and a mark made to where it ought to

              the ends of the two lines, and carelessly omitted the first. From whence, if not from

              altogether inadmissible. For admitting, which we are not guilty of, the antiquity
              claimed by Mr Collier for the marginal annotations of his copy of the Second Folio, we
              agree with Mr R. G. White (<hi rend="italic">Shakespeare's Scholar,</hi> p. 76) that
              &lsquo;the interpolation of an entire line by one man in 1662 is as little
              justifiable as the entire interpolation of an entire scene by another man in 1762 or
              1853.&rsquo; That there is a difficulty in the construction of the speech as it
              stands in the ancient text nobody can deny. But it is surely one susceptible of a
              solution less perilous and arbitrary than the insertion of a new line. Our own
              impression, long before the Perkins Folio came to light, was that the transcriber or
              compositor had slightly erred in the words &lsquo;as little,&rsquo; and that
              the poet probably wrote, <hi rend="italic">of mettle,</hi> i. e., of temper,
              &amp;c.&mdash;&lsquo;I have a heart <hi rend="italic">of mettle</hi> apt
              as yours,&rsquo; which naturally enough led to &lsquo;But yet a
              brain,&rsquo; &amp;c.&mdash;[The reading &lsquo;reproof&rsquo;
              instead of &lsquo;control&rsquo; in the interpolated line, to which Staunton
              calls attention, appears in the text of Collier's ed. ii.; it is, I think, due to
              inadvertence on Collier's part, as it is not thus printed in his subsequent lists; and
              in the text of his ed. iii, 1878, the error&mdash;if such it be&mdash;is
              corrected without remark. See also <hi rend="italic">Appendix:</hi>

                >Johnson Richardson</hi> (R. of Brunne, Chaucer, Gower, Holland, Plinie), and
              Coleridge's <hi rend="italic">Glossarial Index</hi> (R. of Gloucester), and even in

              heart is <hi rend="italic">rapt</hi> in joy; but it might as easily be <hi
                rend="italic">rapt</hi> in anger. But without the violence of interpolating a line
              for which no evidence can be brought due significance may be given to the passage by
              substituting a single word. Let &lsquo;apt&rsquo; be replaced by

              either an aposiopesis at the end of this line, or a line is lost, as Volumnia is
              speaking quite calmly; or, <hi rend="italic">to stoop, to yield,</hi> or something of
              that sort is omitted.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Schmidt</hi> (<hi rend="italic"

              and apt,&rsquo; [I, i, 132]. The numerous attempts by editors at emendation here
              bear witness to their lack of </p>
            <p>knowledge of the language of Shakespeare. [The presumptuousness of the concluding
              sentence is somewhat mitigated by the valid claim to a wide knowledge of Shakespearian
              language resulting from Schmidt's compilation of the <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare
                Lexicon.</hi> This does not, however, seem to have been a sufficient justification,
              since his own countryman, Leo (<hi rend="italic">Jahrbuch,</hi> xv, p. 53), thinks it
              necessary that he &lsquo;take a lance in defence of the Editors,&rsquo;
              remarking that their lack of knowledge of the language of Shakespeare should be shown
              by definite examples, without which such a charge is either unjust or at least
              unsupported. Leo objects to Schmidt's examples in illustration of
              &lsquo;apt&rsquo; in the sense <hi rend="italic">impressible,</hi> because in
              that from <hi rend="italic">Ven. &amp; Ad.</hi> the word is there used
              &lsquo;adverbially and thus stands in grammatical relation to what precedes and
              follows.&rsquo; The example from <hi rend="italic">Timon</hi> is unfortunately
              chosen since the sentence is uncompleted, and therefore might raise the question with
              many editors as to whether a part of the passage had been lost. Suppose the rest of
              the sentence had been, for example, &lsquo;She is young and apt to yield to new
              impressions?&rsquo; How then?&mdash;Leo, for his part, thinks the only
              rational explanation of the passage to be that &lsquo;the words &ldquo;that
              leads my use of anger To better vantage&rdquo; depend equally upon
              &ldquo;heart&rdquo; and &ldquo;brain,&rdquo; and if this indeed is not
              verbally correct, I am led to think,&rsquo; he continues, &lsquo;that we have
              here one of those cases where it is necessary to call upon the language of
              Shakespeare, and especially that peculiarly characteristic rapidity of thought which
              caused him to make verbal leaps, which so irritate the scrupulosity of grammarians.
              His thought may have been as follows: &ldquo;I have a heart as little apt as yours
              to lead, etc., but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better
              vantage.&rdquo; And that he has clothed this in a verbal unprecise form. Such an
              interpretation is quite allowable to almost any editor, even the possibility of
              another emendation, and so I do not in the least regret that in my edition of <hi
                rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> I proposed the reading <hi rend="italic">lightly
              rapt,</hi> and that I there supported it with examples.&rsquo; This must, indeed,
              have caused Schmidt to smile grimly at the wincing of at least one galled jade,
              smarting under the accusation of a lack of acquaintance with the language of
                Shakespeare.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              partly due to P. A. Daniel, which he credits, however, wholly to Daniel [see <hi

              sensitive; as apt to explode if stirred, or to fire up if touched with provocation.

              amendments; and it does not commend itself to our acceptance by any peculiar felicity.
              Far from being happy, the new line is indeed intrinsically feeble, while it causes an
              awkward repetition of the phrase &lsquo;use of anger,&rsquo; and, if I mistake
              not, involves the necessity of putting a different construction on the repeated phrase
              in each line,&mdash; </p>
            <p>confounds, in fact, two different meanings. In the interpolated line <hi

              anger;</hi> in the next line it means <hi rend="italic">proneness</hi> to
              anger&mdash; the custom or habit of growing angry. [As another mode of dealing
              with the Folio text Bailey suggests the reading, &lsquo;I have a heart to kindle
              apt as yours.&rsquo; &lsquo;The transition,&rsquo; he concludes,
              &lsquo;is not easy to imagine, and the suggested reading consequently is not
              entitled to more than to be held in doubt with the rest of the conjectures I have

              her goodness not to do more than she is requested.&rsquo; Volumnia has as little
              apt a disposition (heart) as Coriolanus. The use of <hi rend="italic">apt</hi> is
              essentially the same in both plays, and the context in <hi rend="italic"
              >Coriolanus</hi> makes its meaning as plain within certain limits as if Volumnia had
              proceeded to define it extensively. We may take it as <hi rend="italic"
              >impressible,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">flexible</hi> (&lsquo;as little

                rend="italic">ready, willing</hi> (to return and mend a roughness, or eat humble
              pie). Shakespeare uses the word many times for receptive, teachable, prone, either
              alone (<hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> I, v, 31, &lsquo;I find thee apt; And duller
              shouldst thou be,&rsquo; etc.) or with extension (<hi rend="italic">Lear,</hi> II,
              iv, 309, &lsquo;And what they incense him to, being apt To have his ear
              abused,&rsquo; etc.). No commentator has objected to the word in <hi rend="italic"
                >Othello,</hi> but the text has been tampered with here. Mr Craig seems to have felt
              a difficulty in interpreting &lsquo;apt,&rsquo; and believing that
              &lsquo;anger,&rsquo; l. 39, pointed to Staunton's <hi rend="italic"
              >mettle,</hi> intended to suggest &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">to</hi> mettle apt as
              yours,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> as prone to anger as yours. [This last
              refers to the notes prepared by W. J. Craig for the edition of this play in the <hi
                rend="italic">Arden Sh.,</hi> and left unfinished by his untimely death. Case
              undertook the task of arranging and completing the work. It is noteworthy, I think,
              that up to the time of the unnecessary interpolation by the MS. Corrector neither
              editors nor commentators had been conscious of any corruption or difficulty in this
              passage. The meaning of the word &lsquo;apt&rsquo; was perfectly understood
              apparently. It is not included in the <hi rend="italic">Glossaries</hi> of either
              Hanmer or Capell. Neither Collier nor Singer suggest a change; but with the appearance
              of the MS. interpolation the whole pack is at once in full cry. Singer is the one who,
              unconsciously perhaps, metaphorically drew a herring across the trail and started them
              all on a false scent, hunting a substitute for the word &lsquo;apt,&rsquo; a
              word which Shakespeare uses in many other places, and which, as Case says, has not
              been elsewhere suspected. The latter's excellent note is a fitting finish to the
                discussion.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

                Clarke</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi>): Out of the four passages where
              &lsquo;rote&rsquo; occurs in Shakespeare's plays, the Folio twice spells it,
              as here, &lsquo;roate.&rsquo; We are thus particular in stating this point,
              because Johnson and others change &lsquo;roted&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic"
                >rooted</hi> here. &lsquo;Such words that are but roted in your

              rote in your tongue&rsquo;; mere words acquired by rote and held ready for
              conventional utterance. Shakespeare uses the expression &lsquo;by rote&rsquo;
              to convey the idea of &lsquo;without real meaning,&rsquo; as well as
              &lsquo;by a routine process of memory,&rsquo; in the passage, &lsquo;Oh

              observing, &lsquo;He rather saith it by rote himself, as that he would have, than
              that he can thoroughly believe it, or be persuaded of it.&rsquo; We think that to
              throw out a word like &lsquo;roted&rsquo; merely because there has been no
              instance of its use prior to Shakespeare's is to reject the advantage afforded by
              having such a genius to create expressive words for the language.&mdash;<hi

                >Rooted</hi> gets rid of any difficulty about the preposition, and gives the sense
              that the words suggested go no deeper than the tongue. Reading
              &lsquo;roted&rsquo; we must interpret memorized, learnt by rote, and
              (recollecting also the freer use of prepositions in Shakespeare's time) explain
              &lsquo;in&rsquo; as due to preoccupation with place, the thought of words

              Johnson's edition and Capell's are so nearly synchronous that it is hardly likely that
              Johnson was aware of any of Capell's readings until some time after his own were
              published; and, of course, neither Johnson nor Capell knew of Thirlby's suggestion.
              Capell's <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> did not, however, appear until 1779, and for
              that reason Johnson's note is here given priority.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              &lsquo;Allowance&rsquo; is certainly right. So in <hi rend="italic"

              II, i, 48. Dr Johnson's amendment is, however, countenanced by an expression in the
                <hi rend="italic">Tam. of Shrew,</hi> where Petruchio's stirrups are said to be
              &lsquo;of no kindred,&rsquo; [III, ii, 50].&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

            <p>no allowance, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> approbation to your bosom's
              truth,&rsquo; appeared to me unintelligible. But &lsquo;allowance&rsquo;
              has no connection with the subsequent words, &lsquo;to your bosom's truth. The
              construction is, though but bastards to your bosom's truth, <hi rend="italic">not the
                lawful issue of your heart.</hi> The words, &lsquo;and syllables of no
              allowance,&rsquo; are put in opposition with &lsquo;bastards,&rsquo; and
              are, as it were, parenthetical.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Mason</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Comments,</hi> etc., p. 255): The word <hi rend="italic">alliance</hi>
              differs so little from &lsquo;allowance,&rsquo; it makes the meaning of the
              sentence so clear, and corresponds so well with the word
              &lsquo;bastards,&rsquo; in the line preceding, that I should not hesitate in
              adopting this amendment of Johnson's. Steevens very roundly asserts that
              &lsquo;allowance&rsquo; is the right reading, but he offers nothing in support
              of that assertion except a line from <hi rend="italic">Othello,</hi> which is nothing
              to the purpose. &lsquo;A pilot of very expert and approved allowance&rsquo;
              means only a <hi rend="italic">pilot,</hi> acknowledged and approved to be an expert
              one; and I don't see how the word &lsquo;allowance,&rsquo; in this sense, will
              apply to the present passage. There can be no doubt that
              &lsquo;allowance&rsquo; was used in Shakespeare's time in the sense of <hi
                rend="italic">approbation.</hi> So Lear says, &lsquo;O Heavens! If you do love
              old men, if your sweet sway Allow obedience,&rsquo; [II, iv, 194]. And Johnson, I
              believe, is right in asserting that it means legal right, established rank, or settled
              authority; but none of these words would make sense of the present passage if
              substituted in the place of &lsquo;allowance&rsquo; unless we alter it by
              reading &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">from</hi> your bosom's truth&rsquo; instead
              of <hi rend="italic">to;</hi> and if the passage is to be amended, the most natural
              amendment is to read <hi rend="italic">alliance.</hi>&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap"
                >W. A. Wright</hi>: Though they (the syllables) are not acknowledged as the

              Lord alloweth the righteous.&rsquo; Also in many other places of the English

              and put it on By your allowance.&rsquo; The best explanation of the passage in the
              text that I have met with is furnished me by Mr Joseph Crosby: &lsquo;Truth sits
              enthroned on your bosom, to sanction your thoughts and language; but in the present
              case your words will be but illegitimate offspring, not born of your heart, having no
              approval or justification from that truth, but merely roted in your <hi rend="italic"

                rote.</hi>&rsquo; A verse from <hi rend="italic">Psalm</hi> cxxxix. is not
              irrelevant here, &lsquo;There is not a <hi rend="italic">word in my tongue,</hi>
              but Thou, O Lord, knowest it altogether.&rsquo; I was once led to favour <hi
                rend="italic">alliance,</hi> but am now thoroughly satisfied that
              &lsquo;allowance&rsquo; is right.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi>
                (<hi rend="italic">Student's Sh.</hi>): That is, utterly disavowed by the real

              That is, of no acceptance to your heart's truth, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> to your
              real feelings. &lsquo;Allowance&rsquo; is used with various shades of meaning
              by Shakespeare, such as acknowledgment, approbation, etc., but <hi rend="italic"
                >acceptance</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">Isaiah,</hi> lx, 7, &lsquo;they shall
              come up with acceptance on mine altar&rsquo;) best accounts for the use of the
              preposition &lsquo;to,&rsquo; in which a difficulty is sometimes found. </p>

              This phrase varies in meaning according to circumstances. Here it approximately means,
              get at them this way. [In the passage quoted by Staunton] the stage-direction does not
              determine the sense there, which is: For thus I got at him, got on his weak side.
              Brome also uses the phrase in <hi rend="italic">The Sparagus Garden,</hi> I, i. (ed.
              Pearson, p. 119): &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Gil.</hi> And the cause or ground of

              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the meaning is more or less defined by what precedes, <hi rend="italic"
              >viz.,</hi> &lsquo;never spake a word,&rsquo; and, that was his way with me,
                <hi rend="italic">or</hi> that's how he had me. Shakespeare also uses the phrase, or
              a similar one, in <hi rend="italic">Lear,</hi> IV, vi, 149, in <hi rend="italic">As
                You Like It,</hi> V, ii, 32, and in <hi rend="italic">Winter's Tale,</hi> I, ii,
              217, similarly with slightly varaible meanings, but always indicating that the
              speaker, as the case may be, is conscious of making a good move against another, or of
              being taken, or sought to be taken, at a slight disadvantage.&mdash; [Case's
              admirable summing up of the question and his conclusion that the phrase bears variable
              meanings leaves little to be desired. That here it means, Treat them thus, is to the
              purpose much more than Staunton's paraphrase, suit the action to the word, which
              hardly bears out the forceful character of Volumnia's remarks.&mdash;<hi

              <hi rend="smallcap">Warburton</hi>: But do any of the ancient or modern masters of

              action? Or how does the waving the head correct the stoutness of the heart, or
              evidence humility? Or, lastly, where is the sense or grammar of these words,
              &lsquo;Which often thus,&rsquo; &amp;c.? These questions are sufficient to
              show that the lines are corrupt. I would read, therefore, &lsquo;&mdash;waving

              strike upon thy breast, and by that action show the people thou hast corrected thy
              stout heart. All here is fine and proper.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Johnson</hi>:
              The correction is ingenious, yet I think it not right. <hi rend="italic">Head</hi> or

              The word <hi rend="italic">wave</hi> suits better to the hand, but in considering the

                <hi rend="italic">Which,</hi> &amp;c., is the absolute case, and is to be

            </p>
            <p>[II, i, 571]. In the former of these passages, &lsquo;whom heavens

                possint, praeter nomen virginis, possidentibus.</hi> This mode of speech, though not
              such as we should now use, having been used by Shakespeare, any emendation of this
              contested passage becomes unnecessary. Mason says that there is no verb in the
              sentence, and therefore it must be corrupt. The verb is <hi rend="italic">go,</hi> and
              the sentence not more abrupt than many in these plays. Go to the people, says
              Volumnia, and appear before them in a supplicating attitude,&mdash;with thy bonnet
              in thy hand, thy knees on the ground (for in such cases action is eloquence,
              &amp;c.), waving thy head; <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> by its frequent bendings
              (such as those that I now make), subduing thy stout heart, which now should be as
              humble as the ripest mulberry; or, if these silent gestures of supplication do not
              move them, add words, and say to them, &amp;c. Whoever has seen a player
              supplicating to be heard by the audience when a tumult, for whatever cause, has arisen
              in a theatre will perfectly feel the force of the words &lsquo;waving thy
              head.&rsquo; No emendation whatever appears to me to be necessary in these
                lines.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: All I shall observe respecting
              the validity of the instances adduced by Mr Malone in support of his position is that
              as ancient press-work seldom received any correction, the errors of one printer may
              frequently serve to countenance those of another without affording any legitimate
              decision in matters of phraseology.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Knight</hi>: This
              passage has been a stumbling-block to the commentators; and they want to know how the
              waving of the head corrects the stout heart. They have forgotten the maxim which
              Volumnia has just uttered, &lsquo;Action is eloquence.&rsquo; She is
              explaining her meaning by her action: waving thy head, which often
              wave&mdash;thus&mdash;(and she then waves her head several times). She adds,
              &lsquo;correcting thy stout heart,&rsquo; be &lsquo;humble as the ripest
              mulberry.&rsquo; We owe this interpretation to a pamphlet printed at Edinburgh in
              1814: &lsquo;Explanations and Emendations of Some Passages in the Text of

              &lsquo;here stoop as low as they&rsquo; [for the expression, &lsquo;here

              any harmony at all we must transpose the tonic accent, as it is called, from the
              former to the latter syllable of the word &lsquo;bussing,&rsquo; and so make
              the trochee into an iambus. We propose to read the whole passage thus: <hi rend="bq">

            <p>It is to be remarked that, except in the parenthesis [l. 93], the sense and
              construction of the sentence are kept suspended by participles until the word

              &ldquo;Which often thus,&rdquo;&mdash;having perplexed the printer, he

              emotion. The latter interpretation is, however, not very appropriate to a masterful,
              self-contained character like Volumnia. It seems more likely that some corruption of
              the text has occurred in l. 98 or after. None of the emendations is satisfactory. A
              simple word like &lsquo;Which&rsquo; at the beginning of a line could not be

              <hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 609): That is just the point; and one wonders
              how anyone who knew Coriolanus could expect of him so impossible a feat. There remains
              the expedient of absence, which Cominius, from the third place he assigns to it,
              himself seems to prefer. And in the circumstances it is obviously the best. If only
              the accused had withdrawn for a time, he would soon have been recalled. It is
              inconceivable that when the new expedition of the Volscians, which he alone foresaw,
              broke into Roman territory, the state would not at once have had recourse to the great
              commander. Nor would there have been much difficulty in doing so, since he would
              merely have betaken himself to voluntary retirement; and even had he been exiled in
              default, the mutual exasperation on both sides, which the last collision was to
              produce, </p>
            <p>would have been avoided. But again it is Volumnia's overbearing self-will that
              imposes on him the pernicious choice. And though, as I have said, this proposal is
              ideally the best, for in such cases management and compromise are legitimate enough
              and may be laudable, it is not only the worst in the present instance, but she gives
              it a turn that must have made it peculiarly revolting to her son. In her covetousness
              for the consular dignity she recommends such hypocrisy, trickery, and base cringing as
              the self-respect of no honest man, much less of a Coriolanus, could tolerate. </p>

              &lsquo;barbe&rsquo; is used in this sense. He also remarks that &lsquo;to

              &lsquo;But would that appearance have been particular at Rome in the time of
              Coriolanus?&rsquo; The Puck of Commentators was for once caught napping; he
              answered that &lsquo;Every one but the Dean understands that Shakespeare gives to
              all countries the fashions of his own,&rsquo; apparently forgetting that he had
              begun his note with the remark that this custom was peculiar to Rome. He concludes his
              note with a grudging admission that the signification given by Hawkins may be,
              perhaps, correct. All of which seems to justify the comment of W. A. Wright that
              &lsquo;it is doubtful whether Steevens is serious in this
              interpretation&rsquo; of &lsquo;unbarbed&rsquo; as <hi rend="italic"
                >untrimmed.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;Professor <hi
                rend="smallcap">T. S. Baynes</hi>, in an article in the Edinburgh Review for
              October, 1872 (p. 369), gives so clear an exposition of the matter in dispute as
              between these two interpretations that I gratefully avail myself of his remarks:
              &lsquo;Curiously enough, of the two explanations [of unbarbed], that by Hawkins,
              the more correct, has been almost unanimously rejected by modern editors and critics.
              Thus Mr Dyce explains unbarbed, &ldquo;unshorn, untrimmed,&rdquo; [<hi
                rend="italic">Glossary, s. v.</hi>]; the Cambridge Editors give the same meaning in
              the Globe Edition; while Todd in his edition of Johnson, Richardson in his Dictionary,
              and Nares in his Glossary give &ldquo;unbarbed&rdquo; as unshorn, each quoting
              this passage in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> as the example. Mr Staunton, it is
              true, adopts Hawkins' more correct interpretation, but he does this without a word of
              explanation or defence. Now, with an erroneous rendering in almost undisputed
              possession of the ground, this is hardly sufficient. It is necessary to indicate at
              least the reasons that make the one interpretation right, and the other wrong. It may
              be stated at the outset that the words &ldquo;barbed&rdquo; and </p>
            <p>&ldquo;unbarbed&rdquo; are used both literally and figuratively for shaven
              and unshorn. But in this speech of Coriolanus the term cannot be interpreted in this
              sense, as it would then have no real meauing or relevancy at all. So far as mere
              personal appearance is concerned, Coriolanus had just presented himself in the most
              public and official manner, both in the Capitol and the Forum before the senate and
              the citizens, with the confidence of a proud nature, and the indifference to mere
              pouncet-boxes and curling-irons proper to a soldier and a hero. There could thus be no
              possible reason against his returning, on the ground of mere personal appearance. If
              he really were somewhat rough and unkempt, he would surely, under the circumstances,
              be the better pleased. Least of all would he think of calling in the barber before
              presenting himself to the greasy multitude. The speech obviously refers not to mere
              personal appearance, but to the accredited signs of deference, humility, and respect.
              One of these&mdash;and that the most eloquently submissive&mdash;was
              uncovering, standing bareheaded, and bowing in a lowly manner to the assembled
              citizens. This the proud spirit of Coriolanus could not stomach, and he had the
              greatest difficulty in forcing his stubborn will into even momentary and simulated
              acquiescence. This was the bitterest element in the partial and mocking ceremony he
              had just gone through. When urged by his friends to speak to the citizens and ask
              their suffrages, according to established usage, he replies, <hi rend="bq">
                &ldquo;I cannot<lb rend="RIGHT"/> Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat
                them.&rdquo;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here &ldquo;stand naked&rdquo; cannot, of course, be taken literally, though
              it might be supposed to refer indirectly to showing his wounds. This, however,
              Coriolanus did not do, and the phrase must be understood as referring primarily to the
              fact that he was obliged to stand uncovered, bare-headed, before the &ldquo;bisson
              multitude.&rdquo; But his gall so rises at the degradation, that while going
              through the form he cannot help flouting the citizens to their face, &ldquo;since
              the wisdom of their choice is rather <hi rend="italic">to have my hat</hi> than my
              heart, I will practise the insinuating nod.&rdquo; Again, Volumnia, well knowing
              what the chief difficulty was, addresses herself most earnestly to this point,
              detailing to her son in eager gestures the submissive actions by which he must at once
              seek to regain the popular favour. In her excited and intensely dramatic address [ll.
              91-105] we see Volumnia pointing to her son's bonnet, and showing by her own action
              the way in which he should use it in addressing the citizens. At last, in reply to the
              reiterated and united entreaties of mother and friends, Coriolanus impatiently
              exclaims, &ldquo;Must I go show them my unbarb'd sconce?&rdquo; It may be
              easily shown that &ldquo;unbarbed&rdquo; has the meaning which the context
              thus requires. A war-horse protected by head- and chest-pieces of defensive armour was
              technically said to be <hi rend="italic">barbed, barded,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                >bard,</hi> these being all different forms of the same word derived from the French
                <hi rend="italic">bard&eacute;,</hi> which Cotgrave renders, &ldquo;barbed
              or trapped as a great horse.&rdquo; . . . To show an unbarbed sconce is thus to
              show an uncovered, unprotected sconce; in other words, to appear bareheaded. That the
              word in this connection cannot possibly refer to shaving is evident from the fact that
                <hi rend="italic">sconce</hi> means head, and is never applied to the face by
              Shakespeare or his contemporaries.&rsquo; [This article appears also in Baynes's
              volume, <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare Studies, and Other Essays,</hi> p. 301. Since
              this exposition by Baynes modern editors uniformly adopt this explanation of the word
              &lsquo;unbarbed&rsquo;; Steevens's explanation, though frequently mentioned,
              has been discarded.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              <hi rend="smallcap">F. C. Sharp</hi> (p. 70): In the entire range of Shakespeare's
              plays there is but a single record of a genuine conflict between the impulse to speak
              the truth, at whatever cost, and the desire to dissemble for what, apart from the
              deception, would be recognised as a worthy purpose. Coriolanus, having ruined his
              cause with the people by his plainness of speech, is urged by his friends to return to
              the Forum and disown his insulting epithets. At first he cannot bring himself to
              consent. But the ground of his refusal is no more an objection to deceit as such than
              it is a regard for social veracity. It is solely the aversion of the proud patrician
              to the humiliation of bending his uncovered head before the despised mob, of admitting
              to himself and to them that he dare not say what he pleases. His mother understands
              him perfectly. Determined that he shall yield, her last move is to appeal to his love
              for her, the appeal that had never failed. Coriolanus has within him the spirit of the
              Spartan prisoners who, rather than bear the name of slaves, took their lives. Like the
              medi&aelig;val knight, the lie was disgraceful in his eyes primarily, if not
              solely, because the sign of a cowardly spirit. </p>

                >Perring</hi> (p. 302): Let it be observed that almost in the same breath that
              Volumnia avows a feeling of pride of some sort, <hi rend="italic">she disavows the
                pride which stiffened Coriolanus</hi> (l. 157), as not derived from her, nor
              appertaining to her, <hi rend="italic">but of his own begetting.</hi> And secondly, it
              is evident that Coriolanus felt that his mother had <hi rend="italic">chidden
              him,</hi> and had not come round to his view of her own free will, but rather because
              she felt that she could not do otherwise. Her surrender to her son, then, was not a
              cheerful and spontaneous, but a half-hearted and compulsory one. Thus much generally;
              and now to come to particulars: in what terms does Volumnia describe her own feelings?
              Certainly not as one who <hi rend="italic">feared</hi> the consequences; for (to use
              her own words) she mocked at death with as big a heart as Coriolanus did. How then? As
              one who felt pride, but not exactly the pride which Coriolanus felt; but a rational
              pride akin to what we sometimes call self-respect&mdash;a feeling that she had
              gone as far in entreating her son as a mother, or at least as Coriolanus' mother,
              should. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> would be too proud to be continually suing, and
              continually denied; well then&mdash;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> pride of his she
              too felt; she let it be as he willed; she passively permitted it, albeit it was
              contrary to her wish, her counsel, her best and highest judgment. I can almost fancy
              that Shakespeare had in his mind here that famous chapter in Israelitish history, when
              Jehovah, finding his people were determined to have a visible and temporal king like
              all the nations around them, let them have their will; allowing it rather than
              approving of it, conceding what was, in reality, repugnant to his commands and his
                counsel.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's

              apparently, <hi rend="italic">experience</hi> the worst <hi rend="italic">in one's own

                rend="italic">Warwick Sh.</hi>): Volumnia gives up her cause, and resigns herself to
              the sympathy with Coriolanus's pride, which has throughout been competing with her

              note, says: &lsquo;But his pride is just what she cannot sympathise with, and
              disowns in him&mdash;&ldquo;owe thy pride thyself.&rdquo; Johnson's
              interpretation, though accepted by recent editors, assumes too much, and practically
              identifies &ldquo;pride&rdquo; with &ldquo;stoutness,&rdquo; which
              more nearly corresponds with &ldquo;valiantness.&rdquo; The fact seems to be
              that Volumnia, in her resentment, exhorts herself, not Coriolanus, saying in effect,
              &ldquo;now let the sense of thy pride rather concern thy mother than fear of
              danger of thy valiant obstinacy.&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 511): The accusations brought against
              Coriolanus in Shakespeare are substantially just. He may not seek to wind himself into
              a power tyrannical if we take <hi rend="italic">tyrant,</hi> as Plutarch certainly did
              but as Shakespeare probably did not, in the strict classical sense of <hi
                rend="italic">tyrannus,</hi> but with his disregard of aged custom and his avowed
              opinions of the people, there can be no doubt that he would have wielded the consular
              powers tyrannically, in the ordinary acceptation of the word. For there can be as
              little doubt about his ill-will to the masses and his abhorrence of the tribunitian
              system. And it is on these that he is condemned. It is very noticeable that the
              division of the Antiate spoil, which in Plutarch is the most decisive and
              unwarrantable allegation against him, is mentioned by Shakespeare only in advance as a
              subordinate point that may be brought forward, but, as a matter of fact, it is never
              urged. Shakespeare makes no further use of a circumstance to which Plutarch attaches
              so great importance that he dwells on it twice over and gives it the prominent place
              in the narrative of the trial. This piece of sharp practice becomes quite negligible
              in the play, and the only chicanery of which the tribunes are guilty in the whole
              transaction is that, as in the <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> but more explicitly, they
              goad Coriolanus to a fit of rage in which he avows his real sentiments&mdash;a
              tactical expedient that many politicians would consider perfectly permissible.
              Shakespeare, as has often been pointed out, in some ways shows even less appreciation
              than Plutarch of the merits of the people; so it is all the more significant that, at
              the crisis of the play, he softens down and obliterates the worst traits in their
              proceedings against their enemy. And the second thing we observe is that by all this
              Shakespeare emphasises the insolence and truculence of the hero. It is Coriolanus's
              pride that turns his candidature, which begins under the happiest auspices, to a
              snare. It is still his pride that plays into the Tribunes' hands and makes him repeat
              in mere defiance his offensive speech. It is again his pride, not any calumny about
              his misapplying the profits of his raid, that gives the signal for the adverse
              sentence. Just as in this respect the plebs is represented as, on the whole, less
              ignoble than Plutarch makes it, so Coriolanus's conduct is portrayed as more
              insensate. And this two-fold tendency, to palliate the guilt of Rome and to stress the
              violence that provoked it, appears in the more conspicuous of Shakespeare's subsequent
              deviations from his authority. [Both Verity and Gordon call attention to the
              unfairness in bringing forward this question of the spoils of the
                Antiates.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] </p>

              of this arrangement is lost upon the reader unacquainted with the passage in North's
                <hi rend="italic">Plutarch,</hi> on which it is based: &lsquo;The Tribunes would
              in any case (whatsoeuer came of it) that the people should proceed to giue their
              voyces <hi rend="italic">by Tribes</hi> and not by hundreds; for by this means the

            <p>be of greater force (<hi rend="italic">because their voyces were numbered by the
                polle</hi>) then the noble honest citizens whose persons and purse did dutifully
              serue the common wealth in their warres' (p. 231). The sentence &lsquo;because . .
              . polle&rsquo; is not in the Greek, and it is not a correct explanation of the
              Tribunes' preference for voting by tribes. In the case of both <hi rend="italic"
                >centuries</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tribes</hi> voting was by poll, till the vote
              of a century or tribe was arrived at, and then the vote of century or tribe was given
              as a single one. Without going into questions of Roman constitutional history, it will
              be sufficient to say that in the assembly by centuries (<hi rend="italic">comitia
                centuriata</hi>) the preponderance was given to property. It is more important to
              notice how carefully Shakespeare follows North, taking from him any details which may
              give life to the narrative.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">E. K. Chambers</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Warwick Sh.</hi>) likewise notes that the sentence in regard to voting
              by the poll is an addition of the translator from the Greek. He gives substantially
              the same explanation of the methods of voting by tribes and by centuries as that by
              Beeching, and concludes his note thus: &lsquo;Probably Shakespeare has not quite
              understood the point, even if North did.&rsquo; [The parenthetical explanation is
              perhaps due to Amyot and not North, who translated the French of Amyot, not the
              original Greek. Langhorne's translation of this incident is: &lsquo;But the first
              thing they did, after the people were assembled, was to compel them to give their
              voices by tribes, and not by centuries; thus contriving that the meanest and most
              seditious part of the populace, and those who had no regard to justice or honour,
              might out-vote such as had borne arms, or were of some fortune and
              character.&rsquo; A foot-note adds: &lsquo;From the reign of Servius Tullius
              the voices had been always gathered by centuries. The Consuls were for keeping up the
              ancient custom, being well apprised, that they could save Coriolanus if the voices
              were reckoned by centuries, of which the knights and the wealthiest of the citizens
              made up the majority, being pretty sure of ninety-eight out of a hundred and
              seventy-three. But the artful tribunes, alleging that, in an affair relating to the
              rights of the people, every citizen's vote ought to have its due weight, they would
              not by any means consent to let the voices be collected otherwise than by

              Mr Collier's presumption that these correctors had access to better authority than we

              Singer's two exclamation points, he has, I think, been more lenient than is his wont.
              &lsquo;To have his mouth of contradiction&rsquo; is an ill phrase, a vile
              phrase; how can it, moreover, be made to yield the meaning Collier gives it? It should
              be: To be given his mouth, if it refer to horsemanship. If it mean anything at all it
              must be as we speak of a face of woe, an eye of pity, and thus, a mouth full of

                Wright</hi>: His full quota or proportion as Malone explains it. Coriolanus in
              opposition has always been accustomed to get the best of the bargain. [As regards
              Schmidt's interpretation] the point is not that Coriolanus has acquired this
              character, but that he has always had his own way and cannot brook
                opposition.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Bulloch</hi> (p. 184):

              a very expressive term for one so given as Coriolanus was to the various qualities of

              and &lsquo;cankered&rsquo; occur in Shakespeare above a score of times as noun
              and adjective; in the passage before us it would seem to be a verb. At all events it

              whereas Brutus means the exact opposite. [Malone's interpretation, since it does not

              one. [Sicinius is not here referring directly to the office of the Tribunes, but
              rather to the office which the people held in the government; this it was which
              Coriolanus had always opposed. The words &lsquo;all season'd office&rsquo;
              shows this, I think; had he meant the office of the Tribunes, he would more likely
              have said &lsquo;a season'd office.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              Johnson's explanation to Schmidt's. It is true that, although certain popular rights,
              such as a say in the choice of consul, were of old standing, yet the tribunate was
              quite an innovation. But the tribunes themselves were the last people to make this

              mature&rsquo; (the metaphor of fruit), as in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> III,
              iii, 86. One of the main notions of <hi rend="italic">season</hi> as defined in the
                <hi rend="italic">Century Dictionary</hi> is &lsquo;to fit for any use by time
              or habit; habituate; accustom; mature; inure; acclimatise.&rsquo; No doubt
              Sicinius refers primarily to Coriolanus's attitude towards the tribuneship, and it
              seems in keeping with the Tribune's conceit that he should audaciously apply such a
              term to his recently-created office. Some take <hi rend="italic">season'd</hi> =
              &lsquo;qualified, tempered&rsquo;; the force of which I do not see, unless it
              means that Coriolanus grudges any delegation, however moderate, of the patricians'
              power to the representatives of the people.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi>
                (<hi rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>): The fact that the office of Tribune was not <hi
                rend="italic">season'd</hi> [in the sense given by Johnson] would not hinder
              Sicinius from so describing it; it is true that by far the majority of the cases in
              which the </p>
            <p>verb <hi rend="italic">season</hi> occurs arise unmistakably from the idea of
              flavouring and the related ideas of preserving and of qualifying or tempering [as
              given by Schmidt], while the few which are usually put down under
              &lsquo;mature,&rsquo; &lsquo;ripen&rsquo; may quite well have the same
              origin. The strongest case for &lsquo;mature,&rsquo;
              &lsquo;ripen&rsquo; is <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> I, iii, 81, where
              Polonius says, &lsquo;my blessing season this in thee!&rsquo; but even here it
              is possible to regard the blessing as the preservative, or as the ingredient making
              all palatable. In the same play, III, ii, 219, as ripening or preparing takes time,
              &lsquo;And who in want a hollow friend doth try Directly seasons him his
              enemy,&rsquo; is better explained by <hi rend="italic">flavours, qualifies;</hi>
              and similarly in III, iii, 86, &lsquo;When he is fit and season'd for his
              passage,&rsquo; there can be no question of maturing and ripening, but only of
              being tempered and qualified at a particular time by the seasoning of repentance. In
                <hi rend="italic">Timon,</hi> IV, iii, 85, the context, with salt and tubs, the
              concomitants of pickling, not of ripening, surely fix the metaphor. The <hi
                rend="italic">N. E. D.,</hi> however, places the present passage under the
              figurative use of <hi rend="italic">seasoned</hi> in sense, &lsquo;fitted for use,

              Gifford, in a note on this latter expression (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> p. 519),
              says: &lsquo;Steevens, with his customary disregard of truth in everything which

              evidently caused Jonson to hold this particular word up to ridicule. Steevens thought
              it might not be generally understood, since in his own edition, 1793, he defines the

              &lsquo;courage,&rsquo; and adds: &lsquo;On the other hand, in Beaumont and
              Fletcher's <hi rend="italic">Island Princess,</hi> II, vii. (ed. Dyce, vii, 448), the
              opposite error found its way into the text, and has never been removed; it is where
              the Governor of Ternata speaks of <hi rend="bq"> &ldquo;A coward past recovery, a
                confirm'd coward,<lb/> One without courage, or common sense.&rdquo;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, strange as it may seem considering the context, <hi rend="italic">carriage</hi>
              has always kept possession of the place where &ldquo;courage&rdquo; ought to
              have stood.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Strictures,</hi> etc., p. 157): The MS. Corrector, whose knowledge of the meaning
              of words seems to have been as limited as that of Mr Collier, corrupts this passage in
                <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> just as he has previously corrupted the passage in
                <hi rend="italic">3 Henry VI:</hi> II, ii. In both places the old lection is the
              true one; here &lsquo;my courage&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;my <hi

              &lsquo;this soft courage&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;this <hi
                rend="italic">soft spirit,</hi> this <hi rend="italic"
              >soft-heartedness.</hi>&rsquo; Besides, here the substitution of <hi rend="italic"
                >carriage</hi> for &lsquo;courage&rsquo; introduces an impropriety of
              expression; for, though a man may talk of &lsquo;checking his courage,&rsquo;
              he would hardly talk of &lsquo;checking his carriage&rsquo; (unless, perhaps,
              he were speaking of some &lsquo;vehicular conveyance&rsquo; which he was rich
              enough to keep). As the MS. Corrector has corrupted the passage of <hi rend="italic"
                >Coriolanus</hi> and the passage of <hi rend="italic">Henry VI.</hi> by changing
              &lsquo;courage&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">carriage,</hi> so Mr Collier
              corrupts the passage of <hi rend="italic">The Island Princess</hi> by changing
              &lsquo;carriage&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">courage:</hi>
              <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;Count me a heavy sleepy fool, a coward,<lb/> A coward past
                recovery, a confirm'd coward,<lb/> One without carriage or common
                sense.&rsquo;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would the Governor of Ternata, after <hi rend="italic">three times</hi> proclaiming
              himself <hi rend="italic">a coward,</hi> immediately add that he was one without <hi
                rend="italic">courage?</hi> Nobody, I believe, except Mr Collier would suppose so,
              or would fail to see that &lsquo;one without <hi rend="italic"
              >carriage</hi>&rsquo; means &lsquo;one without <hi rend="italic">conduct,
                management.</hi>&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi> (ed. i.):
              There is no apparent reason why Coriolanus should speak of his <hi rend="italic"

              against him by the people. We therefore accept the correction found in Mr Collier's
              second folio. [Hudson, in his ed. ii, influenced by Dyce, returns to the original
              text, explaining &lsquo;courage&rsquo; here as meaning <hi rend="italic"
                >spirit</hi> or <hi rend="italic">resolution,</hi> but adding that the MS.
              correction &lsquo;seems not unlikely to be the true

                rend="smallcap">Rolfe</hi>: From the context &lsquo;courage&rsquo; here
              seems to be = fearless utterance. Collier considers it &lsquo;inconsistent with

                >courage,</hi>&rsquo; but he simply says &lsquo;I will not restrain my

              sole reason for resuscitating Becket is, that to him rightfully belongs, through
              priority, the credit for this change. In 1856 <hi rend="smallcap">Badham</hi>, in his
              article <hi rend="italic">The Text of Shakespeare,</hi> p. 289, says: &lsquo;For
                <hi rend="italic">envyed against</hi> read <hi rend="italic">enveyed against,</hi>
              or, as Holinshed writes it (I have unfortunately mislaid the reference), <hi
                rend="italic">invaied,</hi> which in our modern orthography would be
              &ldquo;inveigh'd.&rdquo; To envy against a person or thing is foreign to the
              language, and there was nothing to induce Shakespeare to adopt such a license of
              construction. Lyly plays upon the resemblance of the two words (<hi rend="italic"
                >Euphues,</hi> p. 47): &ldquo;Although I have been bolde to invay against many,
              yet am I not so brutish as to envy them all.&rdquo;&rsquo; As will be seen,
              Badham has no doubts as to the originality of his conjectural reading.&mdash; <hi
                rend="smallcap">Staunton</hi> in 1860, likewise with no hint as to having been
              anticipated, notes: &lsquo;&ldquo;Envied&rdquo; here is, perhaps, only a

                it.&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Bailey</hi>, writing in
              1866, is perhaps the most culpable as regards a lack of research in the matter; he
              says: &lsquo;There is an expression in this tragedy that I do not find has struck
              any critic as corrupt,&rsquo; and then quotes this present line, adding (ii, 60):
              &lsquo;Surely we ought to read <hi rend="italic">inveigh'd</hi> &ldquo;against
              the people.&rdquo; The verb <hi rend="italic">inveigh,</hi> it is true, does not
              occur elsewhere in these plays, although the noun <hi rend="italic">invective</hi> is
              found once. But the verb seems to have been familiarly employed by several writers of
              the age, such as Drayton and Holland, and the objection of its non-appearance in
              Shakespeare's writings may be equally adduced against the actual reading. I cannot, in
              any of them, discover the phrase &ldquo;envied against,&rdquo; which, even if
              it were genuine, must be deemed harsh and unusual, if not unprecedented.&rsquo;

                &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">As</hi> is apparently used redundantly with definitions
              of time (as <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> is used in Greek with respect to
              motion). It is said by Halliwell to be an Eastern Counties phrase: <hi rend="bq">
                &ldquo;This is my birthday, as this very day<lb/> Was Cassius born,&rdquo;
                  <hi rend="italic">Jul. C&aelig;s.,</hi> V, i, 72.<lb/> &ldquo;One Lucio as

            </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">as</hi> in the first example may be intended to qualify the
              statement that Cassius was born &ldquo;on this very day,&rdquo; which is not
              literally true, <hi rend="italic">as</hi> meaning &ldquo;as I may say.&rdquo;
              Here, and in our Collect for Christmas Day, &ldquo;as at this time to be

                >anniversary.</hi> In the second example the meaning of &ldquo;as
              then&rdquo; is not so clear; perhaps it means &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">as far
                as regards</hi> that occasion.&rdquo; Compare: <hi rend="bq"> &ldquo;Yet God

            <p>where &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">as</hi> then&rdquo; seems to mean

                &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">als</hi> dann&rdquo; means
              &ldquo;then,&rdquo; and &ldquo;als&rdquo; is applied to other temporal

                >MacCallum</hi> (p. 605): To Volumnia, despite all her maternal preference and
              patrician prejudice, Rome is the grand consideration, as her deeds unequivocally
              prove. Nor is she singular; she is only the most conspicuous example among others of
              her caste. Cominius, too, postpones the family to the state. And this is more or less
              the attitude of the rest. But Coriolanus reverses the sequence, and gives his chief
              homage precisely to the most restricted and elementary, the most primitive and
              instinctive principle of the three [family, State, nobility]. He loves Rome, indeed,
              fights for her, grieves for her shames, and glories in her triumphs; but he loves the
              nobility more, and would by wholesale massacre secure their supremacy. He loves the
              nobility indeed, but when they, no doubt for the common good, suffer him to be
              expelled from Rome, they become to him the &lsquo;dastard nobles&rsquo;; and
              he makes hardly any account of his old henchman and intimate, Menenius, and none at
              all of his old comrade and general, Cominius. But he loves his family as himself, and
              though he strives to root out its claims from his heart, the attempt is vain. </p>

              purport of the speech; which is, to show that the folly of the people was such as was

              reservation, <hi rend="italic">not only others, but even themselves,</hi> and to
              subjugate them as abated captives to some hostile nation. If, according to the old
              copy, the people have the prudence to make reservation of themselves, while they are
              destroying their country, they cannot with any propriety be said to be in that respect
              &lsquo;still their own foes.&rsquo; These words therefore decisively support

              that the people <hi rend="italic">banished themselves</hi> after having banished their

              intended meaning of the passage, which is: &lsquo;Have the power still to banish

              as most subdued captives, to </p>
            <p>some nation that shall have won you without striking a blow.&rsquo; By thus
              telling them that in banishing their defenders and keeping only themselves unbanished
              they do but the more securely provide for their own ultimate departure from Rome as
              miserable captives, we think that Coriolanus's sneer at their
              &lsquo;ignorance&rsquo; is made extra pointed.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Whitelaw</hi>: Banishing your defenders, the nobles, one by one, till you

              &lsquo;Reservation&rsquo; with Shakespeare always has the meaning of
              preserving, holding for one's self, in contradistinction to releasing or setting free.

              suited very well had it followed &lsquo;To banish your defenders&rsquo;; but
              Coriolanus goes on with &lsquo;till at length&rsquo; to describe the final
              catastrophe in which the people would be involved when their ignorance, after making
              them defenceless, could not keep them, but handed them over to the

              enemies. The Folio's reading has been retained by some editors and variously
              explained. . . . Each interpretation seems to me forced and inconsistent with the
              general tenour of the passage and the particular description that follows. [Verity

              the point is, not that they do not spare themselves and no others, and being left to
              themselves, fall a prey to the first attack. Here is the whole force of
              &lsquo;Still your own foes,&rsquo; that they are so without knowing it. They
              think in their ignorance that when they have saved themselves they have saved
              everything. If <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be read all this is lost, and
              &lsquo;Still your own foes&rsquo; becomes superfluous. If they do not spare
              even themselves, it is idle repetition to add that they are their own foes.&mdash;
                <hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>): Retaining
              &lsquo;but&rsquo; the sense of the whole passage is: keep the power to banish
              those who would defend you, until your ignorant policy (which never perceives
              consequences till it undergoes them), reserving only yourselves from banishment, and
              in so doing making you still your own enemies, hand you over, etc. Malone argues
              inconsistency with the purport of the speech, &lsquo;which is to show that the
              folly of the people was such as was likely to destroy the whole of the republic
              without <hi rend="italic">any</hi> reservation, <hi rend="italic">not only others, but
                themselves.</hi>&rsquo; But the reservation in this case is from banishment, not
              from destruction, a distinction which also puts out of court his further argument.
              This being so, the Folio text is here retained, but if Capell's reading had been
              substituted, it must have appealed for support not to Malone's argument, but to its
              giving a sense supposed simplest and most readily perceptible, <hi rend="italic"

              the least reason for substituting <hi rend="italic">not</hi> for

              and the Tribunes. They and the people are the victors. And we may fairly conclude that
              Shakespeare did not despise the cause of the people or its leaders when we find that
              the leaders are represented throughout as men who have kept their heads; cool,
              temperate, prudent, but resolute to attain their end; and using steadily and
              ruthlessly the best means for this end. Having won, they are quite sober and quiet.
              They indulge in no boasting, but go about their business, congratulating themselves on
              the quiet of Rome. Their just mastership of </p>
            <p>the stormy elements of the people keeps down the anger of the partisans of
              Coriolanus. Every day of quiet makes Coriolanus less missed by his friends, who
              &lsquo;blush that without him the world goes well.&rsquo; Menenius has grown
              kind to the Tribunes, and talks to them as if they were nobles. He even criticises
              Coriolanus. Shakespeare has taken pains to lift the struggle of the people into our

              Coriolanus's career in Rome has ended in disaster; but he is not a man to put up with
              disaster contentedly. Already a vague scheme, soon to take dreadful shape, has
              suggested itself to him, whereby he may re-establish himself in his own eyes, and once
              more play a brave part in new scenes and under new conditions. The attempt to carry
              out this scheme forms the subject of the Fourth Act; the Fifth is concerned with its
              ultimate failure. In the first three scenes, however, Coriolanus's designs are not
              directly revealed. For a time our sympathies are allowed to turn towards him in his
              misfortune. His departure is touched with pathos, though beneath there is the tragic
              undertone of an austere and terrible intention. Shakespeare adds a dramatic touch in
              making Coriolanus depart alone, and not &lsquo;with three or four of his
              friends,&rsquo; [as in North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi>]. </p>

              Porter</hi> (<hi rend="italic">First Folio Sh.</hi>): Shakespeare's way to represent
              this on his stage was presumably to represent the group as entering from one of the
              side doors, and bringing Coriolanus out the double doors in the rear stage. These
              could be made to look enough like the gates in a city-wall to be so supposed, as
              already they had been supposed (I, iv, v, vii.), to be the fortified gates of Corioli.

              <hi rend="smallcap">R&ouml;tscher</hi> (p. 23): In this parting from mother and
              wife the nobility of Coriolanus's character is strongly manifested. The tones of his
              heart, which does not want that its innermost quivering be visible, and yet cannot
              conceal the pain of separation, presage wonderfully the hero's catastrophe in the
              Fifth Act. We see the heroic self-command of a great character which knows its full
              worth no less than the loss which he suffers. Such scenes as this are ever most
              difficult in their sensualisation, because they demand at one and the same time the
              full expression of contradictory emotion. Since we wish to see the collectedness and
              self-abnegation of an heroic nature shaken to the depths by a powerful sorrow, the
              sorrow should appear without sentimentality, the pride without stubbornness. The
              broken voice should tremble through this manifestation of nobility, and thus convey to
              us the feeling of inner woe. With this tragic turning of fate the r&ocirc;le of
              Coriolanus ends in the Third Act. </p>

              merely an accidental coincidence with a similar epithet of Horace, or was suggested by
              the Roman satirist's sneer at the Roman populace, Bellua est multorum capitum, which
              Pope has imitated thus: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;Well, if a king's a monster, at the

            <p>[I cannot say whether this comparison was original with Verplanck. It looks, however,

              Verplanck makes the same slip. Verity also calls attention to the similarity of phrase

              has employed the plural here; what ground, therefore, have we for changing a word that
              affords perfect good sense, and is found in the only ancient authentic copy. It is
              decisively confirmed and supported not only by that copy, but by another place in this
              very play, where we meet with exactly the same phraseology, III, ii, 52-54: <hi

              after &lsquo;chances&rsquo; [l. 8] into a comma; still there is something in
              the way Coriolanus employs &lsquo;extremities&rsquo; here that, taken together
              with the capitalization of the word, suggests a collective used here in an abstract
              sense, a condition of things at the extreme. Notice below &lsquo;Fortunes blowes .

              The Second Folio needlessly changed the text to <hi rend="italic">extremity,</hi> a
              reading which some editors adopt; but Malone properly insisted on the correctness of

              editors (not to speak of the Second Folio) were correct in printing the
              singular&mdash;Shakespeare's spelling, if he wrote the singular, being, of course,

              Further, there are nearly thirty examples of the singular
              &lsquo;Extremity&rsquo; in the plays, but only some three or four of the
              plural. &lsquo;Extreme&rsquo; and &lsquo;Extremity&rsquo; are
              favourite words with Shakespeare, and occur many times in the plays. It would seem, on
              the whole, that the balance is in favour of the singular form here. </p>

              It is good to be sure of our author's words before we go to explain their meaning. The
              sense is: &lsquo;When Fortune strikes her hardest blows, to be wounded, and yet
              continue calm, requires a generous policy.&rsquo; He calls this calmness <hi

              Perhaps the first emotions of nature are nearly uniform, and one man differs from

              This line quoted by Johnson, without either title or author, is not given in any of

              as the misprint was easy, are strong reasons for thinking it right. That is,

            <p>The verb &lsquo;craves&rsquo; is singular through attraction to the

                >Times Literary Supplement,</hi> 27 July, 1922, p. 482): Apart from the intolerably
              awkward syntax, the use of &lsquo;gentle&rsquo; is unparalleled; and, after
              the straightforward lines that precede, the sudden tangle brings us up with an
              unpleasant jar. When Shakespeare overrides syntax he usually makes his sense quite
              clear. Moreover, Coriolanus is quoting his mother's proverbs; this one is a riddle. We
              cannot believe that Shakespeare wrote the lines as they stand. The natural sense in
              the context is, &lsquo;Fortune's blows when most struck home, being . . . crave a
              noble cunning.&rsquo; The three words beginning with &lsquo;being&rsquo;
              represent a phrase in apposition to, and explanatory of, &lsquo;Fortune's blows
              when most struck home.&rsquo; We suggest, diffidently, that behind the meaningless
              &lsquo;gentle&rsquo; is concealed the adjective &lsquo;tentles&rsquo;
              (tentless, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> impossible to probe) and that the line
              originally read, &lsquo;When most struck, being tentless wounds, do crave A noble
              cunning.&rsquo; They are wounds beyond the skill of the ordinary surgeon.
              Shakespeare in this martial play was particularly fond of using the word &lsquo;to
              tent&rsquo; metaphorically, see I, ix, 40, and in particular, III, i, 285,
              &lsquo;'Tis a sore upon us you cannot tent yourself.&rsquo; [In a letter to

              and unexceptionable; and it will be observed that the trace and number of the letters
              (viz., 19) in the above italicized words exactly correspond with those of the
              &ldquo;gentle wounded, craves&rdquo; in the Folio reading. This is a matter of
              the utmost importance in the criticism of a doubtful word or passage in the
              Folio.&rsquo; Four years later Cunningham returns to this same passage in a
              communication to <hi rend="italic">Notes &amp; Queries</hi> (October 16, </p>
            <p>1926, p. 274), where he repeats this suggestion of <hi rend="italic">tender</hi> for
              &lsquo;gentle,&rsquo; with substantially the same argument for its acceptance.
              In conclusion he says: &lsquo;But I think there is an even more pertinent
              attribute to be found for &ldquo;wound(e)s,&rdquo; viz., <hi rend="italic"
                >tentless</hi>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) or <hi rend="italic">tentless</hi> or <hi
                rend="italic">tentles,</hi> however it may have appeared in Shakespeare's MS., or
              however the word may have been apprehended by the printers; in any case it is
              remarkably close in point of the <hi rend="italic">ductus literarum</hi> to the word
              &ldquo;gentle.&rdquo; Suppose, therefore, we read,
              &ldquo;&mdash;fortune's blows When most strooke home, being tentlesse wounds,
              do crave A noble cunning,&rdquo; we have sense and syntax equally admirable. But
              why, if &ldquo;tentless&rdquo; is Shakespeare's word, should he have chosen
              such an epithet? Surely he meant that Fortune's blows, not being merely <hi
                rend="italic">physical,</hi> would require a nobler philosophy for their endurance,
              since they could not be &ldquo;tented&rdquo; after the fashion of mere
              physical wounds. Finally, what reason may we assign for the corruption of the text? A
              glance at the Folio may show. I think it was owing to the attempt of the printers to
              get the necessarily excessive amount of type into the line without carrying over into
              the next. They seldom or never carried the words of a line of MS. on to the next, as
              modern printers commonly do. Hence if Shakespeare's MS. had the line in the following
              form, <hi rend="bq"> &ldquo;When most strooke home, being tentlesse woundes, do
                crave,&rdquo;<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>the inference may be justly drawn that the Folio printers found it impossible to get
              his words into the regular lineal space, and (possibly not understanding Shakespeare's
              meaning or his contractions) corrupted the text as we find it in the Folio.
              &ldquo;Tent&rdquo; as a substantive, of course, means lint or other substances
              used to search and cleanse a wound; and, as a verb, to probe it, or apply the
              &ldquo;tent.&rdquo; See I, ix, 40, and III, i, 285 <hi rend="italic"
              >ante;</hi> also <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline,</hi> III, iv, 118, &ldquo;And mine
              ear Therein false struck, can take no greater wound Nor tent to bottom
              that.&rdquo; This last is especially worthy of notice, since
              &ldquo;struck,&rdquo; &ldquo;tent,&rdquo; and
              &ldquo;wound&rdquo; are found in close collocation. Be it noted also that <hi

              removed from each other in point of date.&rsquo; [At first sight it would seem
              that Cunningham, himself, was the author of the Anonymous article in the <hi
                rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement,</hi> and that he is here but amplifying the
              suggestion contained therein. It will, however, be seen that in his letter he speaks
              in high praise of the writer and yet objects to this same suggestion, &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">tentless,</hi>&rsquo; which later he adopts. Two facts which
              militate against Cunningham's being the writer of the original article.&mdash;<hi

              <hi rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Falcon Sh.</hi>): Coriolanus had
              probably not yet resolved upon his revenge. But the words have a dramatic irony,
              inasmuch as that revenge was a legitimate birth of character.&mdash; <hi
                rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 611): It is sometimes said that defeat and the
              desire for vengeance teach him the lessons which his mother had inculcated in vain,
              and that henceforth he shows himself a master of dissimulation, flattery, and
              deception. In proof of this it is usual to cite, in the first place, the farewell
              scene, when he breathes no word to Cominius, Menenius, Virgilia, or Volumnia of his
              intention to join the Volscians and return to overthrow Rome. But was any such
              intention as yet in his mind? In Plutarch he has adopted no definite plan before he
              sets out. . . . If we turn to the parting scene in the tragedy, and let it make its
              own impression, without reading into it suggestions from subsequent occurrences, I
              think we feel that he is not so much undecided as that the idea has not entered into
              his head. We seem to hear the very accent of sincerity in his repetition of the maxims
              that erewhile he learned from his mother's own lips. He seems to hint at seeking out
              new adventures and a new career in new regions beyond the reach of Rome. It was not
              cautelous baits and practice that he would have to fear, but the open violence of
              Aufidius if he already thought of going to Antium, and the simile of the lonely dragon
              more talked of than seen would be abundantly inappropriate if it referred to his
              re-appearance at the head of the Volscian forces; but the expression would be quite
              apt if he meant to make his name redoubtable by his single prowess in strange places
              amidst the risks of an errant life. It is in professed anticipation of this that he
              rejects the companionship which Cominius offers. Are these utterances mere pretence?
              And have not his last farewells the genuine note of cordiality and good-will? If we
              could imagine that he would bring himself to address those whom he afterwards called
              the &lsquo;dastard nobles&rsquo; as &lsquo;my friends of noble
              touch,&rsquo; it would still be impossible to believe him guilty of cold-hearted
              deceit to Virgilia and Volumnia. It would not be like the former champion of Rome to
              return as its assailant; but we may take it that at this moment he is expecting to
              carve his way to glory in a different world and perhaps eventually be recalled to his
              country, but in any case to proceed merely on the old lines insofar as that is
              possible, and meanwhile to be reported of, as Menenius </p>

                rend="smallcap">Case</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>): There is possibly a
              twofold contrast here of the natures of man (in Volumnia) and fox (in Sicinius,
              implying baseness and ingratitude as well as cunning), and of the fool and fox in
              Sicinius. [I am inclined to think that &AElig;sop is largely responsible for
              endowing the fox with the vice of ingratitude. As a character in the Fables he appears
              more often than any other of the animals or personages. In every case it is by some
              subtle trick that he outwits the others, and, in many cases, benefits himself at their
              expense. In the fable of the Countryman and the Fox, where the former deceives the
              huntsmen in regard to the fox's hiding-place, and thus aids him to escape, the fox
              departs without a word of thanks, and is rebuked for his ingratitude. In justification
              of this he replies that the countryman pointed at his place of concealment while he
              said that he had not seen the fox. Topsell, in his enumeration of the epithets applied
              to the fox, does not give &lsquo;ungrateful&rsquo; as one of them. In the many
              exploits and adventures of <hi rend="italic">Reynard the Fox,</hi> subtlety and craft
              are the main characteristics of his behaviour; of the many accusations made against

              Sicinius. Schmidt also thus takes it, without referring, however, to

              >Page</hi>: This speech is by some modern editors given to Volumnia on the ground that
              it is not in keeping with the gentle nature of Virgilia. But very strong feeling
              sometimes forces strong language even from gentle natures. [Compare, &lsquo;And
              doves will peck in safeguard of their brood,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">3 Henry
              VI:</hi> II, ii, 18; also Ibid., I, iv, 41, &lsquo;So doves do peck the falcon's

                rend="smallcap">C. Porter</hi> (<hi rend="italic">First Folio Sh.</hi>): Virgilia is
              moved to burst out to this effect sympathetically, explaining Volumnia's words, when
              the smug Sicinius is too obtuse to imagine why he ought to be in Arabia. Apparently
              Wright does not see the beauty of showing Virgilia thus keyed up to speak; for he
              approves Hanmer's assignment of the speech to Volumnia (although he does not follow
              it). Worse still, he proposes giving Volumnia's last line&mdash;her final taunt at
              the unvalorous Sicinius&mdash;to Virgilia as her petition to the Tribune for
              Coriolanus. Imagine Virgilia calling the Cat who banished her husband <hi
                rend="italic">Good man!</hi> Volumnia calls him so in satire, commenting on his
              official expression of patience under persecution as now acting in all this affair
              ostensibly for Rome's good. He pretends not to mind these women and to cover his
              personal annoyance with forced politeness. Hence Volumnia's comment: &lsquo;Good
              man, the wounds </p>
            <p>that he does beare for Rome!&rsquo; An actor, by start and control of himself,
              should show this. The short line, &lsquo;Bastards, and all,&rsquo; affords the

              <hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's Sh.</hi>): This scene
              illustrates a very instructive feature of Shakespeare's dramatic method, his
              side-scenes (if I may so term them). Take two other instances: first, <hi
                rend="italic">Richard II:</hi> III, iv. Coleridge said of that scene:
              &lsquo;Shakespeare's wonderful judgment appears in his historical plays in the
              introduction of some incident or other, though no way connected, yet serving to give
              an air of historic fact. Thus the scene of the Queen and the Gardener realizes the
              thing, makes the occurrence no longer a segment, but gives an individuality, a
              liveliness and presence.&rsquo; As the gardener and servants talk about the
              unhappy state of England, and we hear their comments on contemporary events, those
              events appear much nearer to us and more vivid; we slip insensibly into the feelings
              of an onlooker. A somewhat similar scene is <hi rend="italic">Jul.
              C&aelig;s.,</hi> II, iv, which depicts Portia, wife of Brutus, restlessly waiting
              to hear how the plot against C&aelig;sar has gone. Such side-scenes give us the
              impressions of those who are watching the course of events from a little distance, and
              we seem to join them as spectators; there, for instance, we cannot help feeling
              something of Portia's anxiety as she waits for news and suddenly thinks that she hears
              a sound from the direction of the Capitol. And the same sort of effect is produced by
                <hi rend="italic">Macbeth,</hi> II, iv. The <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi> of such
              scenes&mdash;always brief scenes&mdash;is that they just mark time to estimate
              and forecast. Hitherto we have been, as it were, amid the rush of tragic incidents;
              now we view them retrospectively, some way off, as when one turns to look back on a
              plain; now we see them as they appear to the non-actors. We learn the immediate
              after-effects of the occurrences at which we have been present, and the next stage is
              foreshadowed. Thus this little scene is literally &lsquo;a highway between Rome
              and Antium&rsquo;; and the end of the way is &lsquo;Antium. Before Aufidius's
              house&rsquo; (Scene iv.). </p>

              reading <hi rend="italic">appayed,</hi> says: &lsquo;No phrase is more common in

            <p>Again, commenting on Collier's MS. Corrector's agreement with Steeven's sug</p>

              language&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">Sh. Vindicated,</hi> etc., p.
                222).&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">R. G. White</hi>: Steevens plausibly proposed
                <hi rend="italic">approv'd;</hi> but I believe the old text is right, the more so
              that there seems to me to have been a jingling quibble intended between

              >Abbott</hi> (&sect; 296): The predilection for transitive verbs was, perhaps,
              among other causes why many verbs which are now used intransitively were used by

              regards showing itself must not yet have any existence. Though these passages might
              be, perhaps, explained without the reflexive use of &lsquo;appear,&rsquo; yet
              this interpretation is made more probable by, &lsquo;Your favour is well
              appear'd,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Coriol.,</hi> IV, iii, 9. [See note on I, ii,
              19, 20, <hi rend="italic">Much Ado,</hi> this edition.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Ed.</hi>]&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Rolfe</hi>: An explanation so improbable
              [as that given by Wright and Abbott] should be admitted only as a last resort. It is
              better, with Schmidt (<hi rend="italic">Lex.</hi>), to take
              &lsquo;appear'd&rsquo; as an adjective equivalent to <hi rend="italic"
                >apparent, discernible</hi> (cf. dishonour'd= dishonourable, in III, i, 78 above) or
              to take &lsquo;is appear'd&rsquo; as=has appeared. For this latter, it is
              true, we have only Dogberry's authority in <hi rend="italic">Much Ado,</hi> IV, ii, 1,
              but on the face of it &lsquo;is appear'd&rsquo; is quite as allowable as <hi
                rend="italic">is arrived, is come,</hi> etc. Abbott (&sect; 295) calls these
              &lsquo;passive verbs&rsquo;; though they are simply active
              &lsquo;perfects&rsquo; (or &lsquo;present perfects,&rsquo; or whatever
              the grammars may call them) with the auxiliary <hi rend="italic">be</hi> instead of
                <hi rend="italic">have,</hi> as in the French <hi rend="italic">est
                arriv&eacute;,</hi> the German <hi rend="italic">ist gekommen,</hi> etc. <hi
                rend="italic">Apparaitre,</hi> by the way, is conjugated with <hi rend="italic"
                >&ecirc;tre</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">avoir.</hi>&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Henry Irving Sh</hi>): The sense
              required is, &lsquo;your identity is made more apparent by your tongue, your face
              is helped by your tongue&rsquo;; the Volsce combines these into &lsquo;your
              favour is well appeared (or made apparent) by your tongue.&rsquo; But as this
              transitive use of &lsquo;appear&rsquo; is unsupported, it may be a misprint.
              Steevens's <hi rend="italic">approved</hi> misses the sense.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi> (ed. ii.): It is evident that the authors of the changes

              pointing out a good many instances where that word is clearly used as a transitive
              verb, meaning to <hi rend="italic">show,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">manifest,</hi> to
                <hi rend="italic">make apparent,</hi> to present, &amp;c. So in <hi

              mind that, through the sight I bear in things to come.&rsquo; See also III, i,

                >Warwick Sh.</hi>): The Folio reading might possibly mean &lsquo;is made
              apparent,&rsquo; but &lsquo;appear&rsquo; is not elsewhere used in this
              transitive sense. The point is: my imperfect remembrance of your
              &lsquo;favour&rsquo; or countenance is &lsquo;approved&rsquo; or
              confirmed by my remembrance of your voice.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Kinnear</hi>
              (p. 325): That is, your person has been manifested by your speech&mdash;your
              tongue has told me plainly who you are. The Folio has &lsquo;<hi rend="italic"
              >is</hi> well appeared,&rsquo; evidently a misprint, as no such construction is
              found in Shakespeare, nor has any instance been cited from other writers. The
              correction <hi rend="italic">has</hi> is by Malone.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Perring</hi> (p. 305): Is it not possible that, in Shakespeare's day, the
              participle may have been permitted to occupy the place of the adjective? &lsquo;Is
              entered&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;is arrived&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;is
              approached&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;is become&rsquo; are </p>
            <p>all found in Shakespeare, used pretty much, if not exactly, like
              &lsquo;enters,&rsquo; &lsquo;arrives,&rsquo;
              &lsquo;approaches,&rsquo; &amp;c. Similarly, &lsquo;is
              appeared&rsquo; and &lsquo;appears&rsquo; may both have been tolerated.
              There is an old smack about &lsquo;is appeared,&rsquo; which, though some may
              not relish it, perhaps they must stomach. I am very much inclined to believe that it

              [after &lsquo;know'st me,&rsquo; l. 58] as prose. Editors follow it in the
              first two lines, and then, making &lsquo;If Tullus&rsquo; a short line,
              rightly go on in verse. Their arrangement is, however, hardly satisfactory, for a
              tripody, a tetrapody, and a monopody in succession form a sequence that is, I should
              say, without parallel. The fact is, nothing can be done with the lines if the Folio's
              abbreviations are retained, and I would read and arrange as follows: <hi rend="bq">
                  &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Auf.</hi> Whence &verbar; com'st thou? What
                &verbar; wouldst thou?<lb/> Thy &verbar; name? Why &verbar; <hi

              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Line 59 is now of the common type which has a trochaic beginning immediately </p>
            <p>followed by a resolution. &lsquo;If&rsquo; properly occupies a whole foot
              because of the pause made after it for emphasis. Such a pause must be made in
              delivering the words whatever arrangement be adopted, and since it is important, the
              poet naturally so provided for it. Coriolanus, who speaks in the low and lifeless
              tones of a broken man, begins very slowly and with great solemnity, his manner forming
              a fine dramatic contrast to the impatiently sharp and jerky sentences of Aufidius. It
              is a telling situation if well acted, and Shakespeare, even though he was Shakespeare,
              must have expended some little thought upon it. I cannot forbear drawing attention to
              the perfect rhythm of the three lines uttered by Coriolanus. But for the trifling
              inversion &lsquo;not yet thou know'st&rsquo; for &lsquo;thou knowest not
              yet&rsquo; the sentence has the balance of natural and musical prose; indeed, if
              it were not marked off into lines, many would take it for prose, as did the reviser of
              the Folio. Yet it is verse of Shakespeare's very best for rhythm and balance, and the
              art shown in one point in particular, the quadrisyllabic &lsquo;Think me for
              the,&rsquo; is worth noting. He might have written &lsquo;Think me the
              &verbar; man I &verbar; am,&rsquo; but he does not. With that sense of
              dramatic fitness which never ceases to amaze us, just in order that Coriolanus may not
              too obviously be speaking in verse at such a moment, he modifies the ordinary rhythm
              by the introduction of the single syllable &lsquo;for,&rsquo; and the disguise
              is as complete as it need be. It would be difficult to find a better illustration of
              the ideal of blank verse at which he aimed in his mature work&mdash; prose that is
              also verse, and verse that is not, and yet might be, prose. </p>

              Shakespeare evidently recognised that it would be difficult to improve upon the
              virility and the simplicity of Sir Thomas's translation, not from the Greek, be it
              remembered, but from Amyot's French. On this point Trench (p. 59) has this to say:
              &lsquo;A word or two on this subject of Shakespeare's obligations to Plutarch.
              Nowhere, as is abundantly clear, does our English poet make any pretence of concealing
              these, but adopts </p>
            <p>all, even to the very words of Sir Thomas North, with only such transposition and
              alteration as may be necessary to give them a rhythmical cadence and flow. He is too
              rich, and conscious that he is too rich to fear the charge of endeavoring to pass
              himself off for such by the laying of his hands upon the riches of others. And here,
              indeed, is what properly determines whether an author should be adjudged by us as a
              plagiarist or not. The question is not what he appropriates, but what proportion these
              appropriations bear to that which he has of his own; whether, if these were withdrawn
              and resumed by their rightful owners, they would leave him poor. If such would be the
              result, then, however few and small these may have been, we can count him no better
              than a daw, passing himself off for a peacock by the aid of feathers stuck into his
              plumage, and not properly his own. If, on the other hand, all revindication by others
              of what is theirs would leave him essentially as rich as he was before, his position
              in the world of poetry is not affected by the bringing home to him of any number of
              these appropriations. We need not fear to allow Shakespeare to be tried by this rule;
              and we can only admire that noble confidence in his own resources which left him free
              without scruple to adopt and to turn to his own uses whatever he anywhere found which
              was likely to prove serviceable to the needs of his art.&rsquo; [See <hi

              iv, 51): Aufidius recognizes Coriolanus as soon as he casts aside his disguise; he
              feigns for a short time not to know him in order to bring his hated opponent to a
              circumstantial declaration, and under cover of this to form his own plan as to how he
              will treat him. However warm and sincere his first speech, beginning &lsquo;Oh
              Martius, Martius,&rsquo; may sound, it is by no means honest. The superabundance
              of his expressions and his bearing towards Coriolanus as the <hi rend="italic">3<hi
                  rend="sup">d</hi> Servant</hi> describes it [ll. 199-210] plainly point to
              dissimulation and duplicity. It is, indeed, quite usual with Shakespeare, if he
              portrays love and faith in the form of hypocrisy, to choose the most glaring colours.
              As regards Aufidius it is for the first time, at the close of the play, when his hated
              opponent lies dead before him, that we may trust his words when he says: <hi rend="bq"
                > &lsquo;My rage is gone<lb rend="RIGHT"/> And I am struck with
                sorrow.&rsquo;&mdash;<lb/>

            <p><hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's Sh.</hi>): We have noted
              how closely Shakespeare has followed North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> in the
              speech assigned to Coriolanus. Here we should observe how he has amplified the very
              brief reply of Tullus Aufidius given by Plutarch. </p>
            <p>This amplification is part of Shakespeare's general treatment of the Aufidius
              element, which bulks far more important in the play than in the history.&mdash;
                <hi rend="smallcap">S. Brooke</hi> (p. 239): Aufidius is the instrument of the fate
              of Coriolanus. He shows the bottom of his heart in his answer to his former enemy. But
              his envy is only rooted out because he sees his ancient foe in the gloom of
              misfortune. Envy is too subtle a devil to leave the heart so soon, and Shakespeare
              knows its fashions. Moreover, with envy ever goes hate. It is envy's boon companion.
              And Aufidius's hate was deep: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;Where I find him, were it<lb
                  rend="RIGHT"/> At home, upon my brother's guard, even there<lb/> Against the
                hospitable canon, would I<lb/> Wash my fierce hand in 's heart,&rsquo; [I, x,
                27-30].<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such a hatred does not die; it only sleeps for a time. We have a comfortable way of
              thinking that our vices have gone when the reason of them is momentarily taken away.
              It was agreeable to Aufidius at first to be magnanimous to his rival, to be able to
              say &lsquo;Poor Coriolanus,&rsquo; and to give him half his power. That
              flattered his patronising pride. But the moment Coriolanus again took precedence, envy
              came back with seven more devils than before; and in the resurrection of this envy and
              its results lies the rest of the drama. The envy of Aufidius is deepened by the pride
              of Coriolanus, who will, even in exile, have the first place; and he uses this
              insolent pride, as the Tribunes used it before, to work the ruin of Coriolanus, who
              had learned nothing from all his pain and follies, who was still himself his only law,
              his only right. </p>

              <hi rend="smallcap">F. Harris</hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Man Sh.,</hi> p. 242):
              Aufidius was not such a friend to Coriolanus that we can take his protestation
              seriously. The argument is evidently a stock argument to Shakespeare; a part of the
              ordinary furniture of his mind; it is like a fashionable dress of the
              period&mdash;the wearer does not notice its peculiarity. The truth is, Shakespeare
              found in the literature of his time, and in the minds of his contemporaries, a
              fantastically high appreciation of friendship with a corresponding disdain for love as
              we moderns understand it. In <hi rend="italic">Wit's Commonwealth,</hi> 1598, we find,
              &lsquo;The love of men to women is a thing common and of course, but the
              friendship of man to man, infinite and immortal.&rsquo; Passionate devotion to
              friendship is a sort of mark of the Renaissance, and the words
              &lsquo;love&rsquo; and &lsquo;lover&rsquo; in Elizabethan English were
              commonly used for &lsquo;friend&rsquo; and &lsquo;friendship.&rsquo;
              Moreover, one must not forget that Lyly, whose euphuistic speech affected Shakespeare
              for years, had handled this same incident in his <hi rend="italic">Campaspe,</hi>
              where Alexander gives up his love to his rival, Apelles. Shakespeare, not to be
              outdone in any loyalty, sets forth the same fantastical devotion in his sonnets and
              plays. </p>

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: Shakespeare was unaware that a Roman bride, on her
              entry into her husband's house, was prohibited from <hi rend="italic">bestriding</hi>
              his threshold; and that, lest she should even touch it, she was always lifted over it.
              Thus Lucan, ii, 359, &lsquo;Tralata vetuit contingere limina
                planta.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">C. &amp; M. Cowden Clarke</hi>
                (<hi rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi>): So far from proving that Shakespeare was
              &lsquo;unaware&rsquo; of the custom in question, we think that the present
              passage shows that he knew the classic ceremonial of receiving a bride at the entrance
              of the bridegroom's house, of her being borne across the threshold, and of its having
              been thus specially marked as the barrier which separated her from her girlhood's
              condition, and which introduced her to the new sphere of a wedded home and wedded
              duties. We think that Shakespeare's making Aufidius advert thus particularly to the
              point when first he beheld his wedded mistress cross his threshold, betokens the
              poet's perfect consciousness that there was an ancient solemn rite connected with the
              circumstance; and that the word &lsquo;bestride&rsquo; is not to be taken
              literally for &lsquo;step across,&rsquo; but is to be taken as meaning
              &lsquo;pass over,&rsquo; &lsquo;cross over.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi>: A Roman bride was carried over the threshold of
              her husband's house. We know nothing of the custom of Antium in this respect, nor did
              Shakespeare. [As a comment on Steevens's patronising and pompous note this, by Wright,
              is, I think, much better than that by the Cowden Clarkes. Wright plainly shows that
              the question does not merit serious discussion.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

                Folio Sh.</hi>): Aufidius is in an ecstatic mood, and must use an energetic word for
              the act of entering a threshold. Besides he has already passed from his figure of
              speech as to his Bride crossing his threshold to this new-beloved warrior putting the
              first foot over, in the act of entrance, according to Roman custom, without touching
              the threshold itself, which it was unlucky to do. Hence brides were carried over. </p>

              friendship, each ignorant of what their passions of pride and envy are sure to
              produce. But the servants see much further than their masters. They see the folly of
              both these great men and laugh at it, especially at that of their master. Their talk
              is an excellent piece of wit, of human nature; and also of their class, when they are
              mere hirelings. They have not a vestige of care for their country, only for their own
              interests. &lsquo;Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as day does night; it's

              sombre as it nears the close; but their occasional introduction in the Fourth Act, and
              even later, affords variety and relief, and also heightens by contrast the tragic
              feelings. For example, there is a touch of comedy in the conversation of Lady Macduff
              with her little boy. Purely and delightfully humourous are the talk and behaviour of
              the servants in that admirable scene where Coriolanus comes disguised to the house of

              entry of the Third Servingman, the first impression on reading Dyce's text, namely,
              that Coriolanus is intended in both cases, is confirmed. The ambiguity in ll. 170-172
              arises from the fact that the words &lsquo;but a greater soldier than he you wot
              on&rsquo; may mean a qualification of assent to the <hi rend="italic">rare
                excellence</hi> of Coriolanus in this particular sense, &lsquo;but you know of a

              what to make of it, and ask its meaning; and then making the Third Servant avoid the
              inconvenient enquiry by not noticing it, but running on with his own harangue. [Were

              because it is clear that the author meant to show the fellow losing his little meaning

                >Edinburgh Review,</hi> Oct., 1892, p. 339): The phrase &lsquo;full of
              vent&rsquo; has so perplexed the critics that more than one has proposed to
              substitute for it &lsquo;full of vaunt.&rsquo; The Folio text is, however,
              perfectly accurate, and peculiarly expressive, although it has never yet been
              correctly explained. The only explanation attempted is that of Johnson, repeated by
              subsequent editors, that &lsquo;full of vent&rsquo; means &lsquo;full of
              rumour, full of materials of [for] discourse.&rsquo; This, however, is a mere
              conjecture, and not a happy one, as it altogether misses the distinctive meaning of
              the phrase. &lsquo;Vent&rsquo; is a technical term in hunting to express the
              scenting of the game by the hounds employed in the chase. Both noun and verb are
              habitually used in this sense. Their exact meaning and use will be made clear by an
              extract or two from Turberville's translation of Du Fouilloux, the popular manual of
              hunting in Shakespeare's day. The first extract refers to the wiles and subtleties of
              the hart when keenly pressed in the chase: &lsquo;therewithall he wil lie flat
              downe vpon his bellie in some of their layres, and so let the houndes ouershoote him:
              and bicause they should have no sent of him, nor vent him, he wil trusse all his
              .iiii. feete vnder his belly and wil blow and breath vpon ye grounde in some moyst
              place: in such sorte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue seene the houndes passe by such an
              Harte within a yeard of him and neuer vent him,&rsquo; [<hi rend="italic">Booke of
                Hunting,</hi> Tudor and Stuart Library, p. 111]. Further on the author, speaking of
              the hart, says again expressly, &lsquo;When he smelleth or venteth anything, we
              say he hath this or that in the wind.&rsquo; In the same way, when the hound vents
              anything, he pauses to verify the scent, and then, full of eager excitement, strains
              in the leash to be after the game that is thus perceived to be a-foot. The following
              extract from the rhyming report of a huntsman upon sight of a hart in pride of grease
              illustrates this: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;Then if my Prince, demaund what head he
                beare,<lb/> I answere thus, with sober words and cheare:<lb/> My liege I went, this
                morning on my quest,<lb/> My hound did sticke, and seemde to vent some
                beast,&rsquo; [Op. cit., p. 96].<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The use of the noun is exemplified in another hunting rhyme, or huntsman's soliloquy,
              entitled &lsquo;The Blazon of the Hart,&rsquo; which is of special interest
              from the vividness of the picture it brings before us: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;And
                whiles I seeke his slotte where he hath fedde<lb/> The sweete byrdes sing, to cheare
                my drowsie hedde<lb/> And when my Hounde, doth streyne vpon good vent,<lb/> I must
                confesse, the same dothe me content,&rsquo; [p. 60].<lb/>
              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The technical meaning and use of the word in these passages is sufficiently clear,
              and it will be seen how happily Shakespeare employs it. To strain at the lyam or leash
              &lsquo;upon good vent&rsquo; is in Shakespeare's phrase to be &lsquo;full
              of vent,&rsquo; or in other words, keenly excited, full of pluck and courage, of
              throbbing energy and impetuous desire, in a word, full of all the kindling stir and
              commotion of anticipated conflict. This is not only in harmony with the passage, but
              gives point and force to the whole description. War is naturally personified as a
              trained hound roused to animated motion by the scent of game, giving tongue, and
              straining in the slips at the near prospect of the exciting chase. This explanation
              justifies the reading of the Folios, &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">sprightly
              walking,</hi> audible, full of vent,&rsquo; or at least </p>
            <p>affords a better explanation of it than has yet been offered. Staunton explains
              &lsquo;sprightly walking&rsquo; as &lsquo;quick moving or
              marching,&rsquo; with evident reference to military movements, and with regard to
              the special phrase under review he says boldly, &lsquo;vent is voice,
              utterance.&rsquo; But the previous epithet, &lsquo;audible,&rsquo; gives
              this feature of the description &lsquo;vent,&rsquo; referring not to sound at
              all, but to the quick perception of the game, and the signs of eagerness, such as
              kindled eye, dilated nostril, and muscular impatience, which keen relish for the sport
              produces. In such a connection &lsquo;sprightly walking&rsquo; would refer to
              the more lively and definite advance arising from the discovery of good vent as
              compared with the dissatisfied snuffings and uncertain progress when nothing is in
              view. [This article is reprinted in Baynes's volume, <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare

                >Lexicon,</hi> s. v. Vent (5), with the present passage as the only example, adding,
              &lsquo;If &ldquo;vent&rdquo; is, indeed, a technical term of sportsmen for
              scent, as it has been asserted in <hi rend="italic">Edinb. Rev.,</hi> Oct., 1872, and
              it could be proved to have been so in the time of Shakespeare, the explanation given
              there would be undoubtedly preferable to any other.&rsquo;&mdash; <hi
                rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi>: According to the view [of the writer in the <hi
                rend="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</hi>] war is compared to a pack of hounds in full
              cry. But I think it is scarcely in accordance with what follows in the description of
              peace, where the epithets appear to correspond to the epithets applied to war, but in
              an inverted order: &lsquo;insensible&rsquo; corresponding to
              &lsquo;spritely,&rsquo; &lsquo;sleepy&rsquo; to
              &lsquo;waking,&rsquo; &lsquo;deaf&rsquo; to
              &lsquo;audible,&rsquo; and &lsquo;mulled&rsquo; to &lsquo;full of
              vent.&rsquo; If this view is correct, the figure involved in &lsquo;full of
              vent&rsquo; is not from the hunting field, but the expression must be descriptive
              of something in wine which is the opposite to that conveyed by
              &lsquo;mulled.&rsquo; And as &lsquo;mulled&rsquo; signifies
              &lsquo;flat, insipid,&rsquo; &lsquo;full of vent&rsquo; would seem to
              be either effervescent, working, ready to burst the cask, or full of scent. Cotgrave,
              indeed, gives &lsquo;Odorement . . . a smell, waft, sent, vent&rsquo;; but it
              does not appear from this that &lsquo;vent&rsquo; means
              &lsquo;scent&rsquo; except as a hunting term, and I therefore hesitate to
              suggest that it is equivalent to what is now termed the bouquet of wine.&mdash;<hi

              vent&rsquo; is opposed to &lsquo;mulled&rsquo; in the next line. The
              meaning of neither expression is clear, but probably the metaphor is from wine in both
              cases, &lsquo;full of vent&rsquo; meaning lively, ready to escape from the
              cask or bottle, while mulled wine is a comparatively flat concoction.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Madden</hi> (p. 53, foot-note), in corroboration of Baynes's

                >Shepheard's Calendar</hi>) and Drayton (<hi rend="italic">Polyolbion</hi>). It is
              the Norman-French equivalent for the Anglo-Saxon &ldquo;wind,&rdquo; used
              frequently in the sense of <hi rend="italic">scent</hi>
            </p>
            <p>by Shakespeare, both as a verb and as a substantive: <hi rend="italic">Tit.

                &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">venteth,</hi> snuffeth in the winde.&rdquo; It is
              strange that the restoration of the Folio thus suggested has not been generally

              being shown that the word &ldquo;vent&rdquo; bore the meaning attributed to

              like a hound which strikes the trail and at once &lsquo;gives tongue&rsquo;;
              compare &lsquo;audible.&rsquo; The metaphor here from hunting follows
              naturally on the metaphor in ll. 217, 218; and Shakespeare more than once compares war
              with a hound. The <hi rend="italic">Glossary</hi> of the Globe ed. has,
              &lsquo;like wine, full of working, effervescent, opposed to
              &ldquo;mulled.&rdquo;&rsquo; But the other explanation of
              &lsquo;vent&rsquo; as a term of the chase is the one now commonly accepted,
              and there can be little doubt, if any, as to its correctness now that the history of
              &lsquo;vent&rsquo; has been fully ascertained. Note that it opposes the phrase
              not merely to &lsquo;mulled,&rsquo; but to the whole description of peace,
              especially to &lsquo;insensible.&rsquo; I see no need to pair off each epithet
              as a precise contrast. The speaker is a serving-man, and such people are not masters
              of exact antithesis.&mdash;Miss <hi rend="smallcap">C. Porter</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">First Folio Sh.</hi>): Scenting the game ahead and full of life, as a
              hound strains to be let loose for the chase when upon the scent,
              &lsquo;vent&rsquo; being for the hound, in hunting terminology, what
              &lsquo;in blood&rsquo; is for the game.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Gordon</hi>: &lsquo;Full of vent&rsquo; is literally full of emission or
              discharge; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> bursting with strong life (like strong wine),
              bubbling over, effervescent; opposed to &lsquo;mulled&rsquo; in the next line.
              Compare I, i, 243, &lsquo;to vent Our mustie superfluity.&rsquo; This
              explanation is a modification of that given by the Globe editors. The explanation now
              in favour is that &lsquo;vent&rsquo; is a hunting term. A hound was said to
              &lsquo;vent&rsquo; the game when he smelt him in the wind. War would then be
              likened to a pack of hounds in full cry; &lsquo;audible&rsquo; would express
              their cry; and &lsquo;full of vent&rsquo; would mean &lsquo;full of the
              spirit of the chase.&rsquo; This is attractive but far-fetched. It is obtained by
              (1) singling out for over-emphasis one term of the four, and (2) entirely neglecting
              the antithesis in the four terms that follow in ll. 229, 230. The antithesis is strict
              and unmistakable: &lsquo;insensible&rsquo; ((&lsquo;spritely,&rsquo;
              &lsquo;sleepy&rsquo;) (&lsquo;waking,&rsquo;
              &lsquo;deaf&rsquo;) (&lsquo;audible,&rsquo;
              &lsquo;mulled&rsquo;)), &lsquo;full of vent.&rsquo; The hunting men
              who proposed the explanation may be pardoned their over-emphasis, but not their
              neglect of the whole structure of the passage. If &lsquo;mulled&rsquo;
              corresponds to &lsquo;full of vent,&rsquo; as it must, then &lsquo;full of
              vent&rsquo; can have nothing to do with hunting.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap"
                >Deighton</hi> apparently accepts the interpretation offered by Baynes that
              &lsquo;vent&rsquo; is here used as the technical hunting term for <hi
                rend="italic">scent.</hi> As regards Wright's interpretation Deighton remarks:
              &lsquo;Granting a correspondency between the epithets (though
              &ldquo;deaf&rdquo; can hardly be said to correspond with
              &ldquo;audible&rdquo;), we have no proof that &ldquo;mulled&rdquo;
              meant in Shakespeare's day &ldquo;flat, insipid.&rdquo; At present the term is
              generally used of wine boiled with sugar and spices. But this modern sense Skeat says
              is due to a total loss of the original sense of the word. &ldquo;The older form is
                <hi rend="italic">mulled ale,</hi> a corruption of <hi rend="italic">muld-ale</hi>
              or <hi rend="italic">mold-ale,</hi> literally a funeral ale or banquet. . . . Compare
              Lowland Scotch <hi rend="italic">mulde-mete,</hi> literally mould-meat, a </p>
            <p>funeral banquet.&rdquo; In this uncertainty as to the figures intended I have
              preferred to retain the Folio reading &ldquo;sprightly
                walking.&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>): As war is spritely, wide awake, keen of ear, so,
              possibly, it is full of utterance, vents much; compare &lsquo;What his breast
              forges, that his tongue must vent,&rsquo; III, i, 316. Others are confident of
              allusion to hunting in the technical term <hi rend="italic">vent,</hi> and some trace
              a personification of war as a trained hound through the series of expressions. It is
              true that Shakespeare makes war a dog elsewhere, but in plain language. Mr Craig, in
              the <hi rend="italic">Little Quarto Shakespeare,</hi> combating this idea, thinks that
              &lsquo;&ldquo;full of vent&rdquo; may mean, very efficacious to clear the
              country of its surplus population,&rsquo; and refers to I, i, 243, 244. This is
              given here as his only recorded interpretation of the passage, but with emphatic
              dissent. Wright sees an apposition in the epithets given to war and peace
              respectively, taken in reverse order. A correspondence may exist, but it may also be
              only apparent or accidental. Such exactitude is in strong contrast with what follows.
              That which is sprightly, walking, etc., may indeed destroy men, but apoplexy,
              lethargy, or anything sleepy and insensible may be acquitted of any activity in
              getting bastards. </p>

              which ripens into war. Apoplexy is here confounded with lethargy, which is described
              as proceeding by the degrees&mdash;mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible. The term
              &lsquo;apoplexy&rsquo; is used rather loosely by Shakespeare in many places,

              one of two things. Either with Walker insert <hi rend="italic">a</hi> before
              &lsquo;lethargy,&rsquo; and also punctuate <hi rend="italic">apoplexy;</hi>
              this makes the clause from &lsquo;lethargy&rsquo; an explanation of
              &lsquo;apoplexy&rsquo;; and it may be remarked that such an explanation agrees
              very exactly with Falstaff's, &lsquo;This apoplexy is, I take it, a kind of
              lethargy; . . . a kind of sleeping in the blood&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">2 Henry

              suggestion it should be remembered that in those days &lsquo;apoplexy&rsquo;
              did not bring to mind those ideas with which it is now associated. Thus Andrew Boord, </p>
            <p>&lsquo;Doctor of Phisicke,&rsquo; in fol. 16 of the Breviarie of Health,

              which crowns all such pretences, Mull'd them again into their senses.&rsquo; It
              is, however, difficult to give this sense of dull, stupefy to Cotton's word even
              ironically. It occurs in a <hi rend="italic">Burlesque upon the Great Frost</hi> and
              refers to two sides at foot-ball who were literally frozen stiff, &lsquo;With a

                >mul,</hi> soft), of which Mull [to dull, stupefy] might be another

              was in the &lsquo;peace and quietness of the people&rsquo; that the Tribunes
              had their supposed triumph over the Patricians, who had hoped to see
              &lsquo;dissentious numbers pestering the streets,&rsquo; but whom this peace
              and quietness forced to blush that the world went well. This is entirely lost if the
              Tribunes are made to say that they make Coriolanus's friends blush. The rhythm of ll.
              2 and 3 is also much more Shakespearian with a full pause after
              &lsquo;tame.&rsquo; This play is very carelessly printed in the Folio; and I
              believe that &lsquo;we&rsquo; crept in merely by the erroneous supposition of
              a printer that a new sentence began at &lsquo;Heere,&rsquo; and that a

              substantially&mdash;though White does not say so&mdash; Hanmer's. White's only
              change being a shifting of the comma. See also note by Hudson, l. 5.&mdash;<hi

              (p. 306): What is easier than to construe this line thus, His remedies are tame, the
              present [is] peace and quietness of the people, which [that is, who] were before in
              wild hurry. On the one hand, the substantive verb is dropped in the second sentence,
              because &lsquo;are&rsquo; has been expressed in the first; on the other hand,
              &lsquo;the present&rsquo; is used as a noun substantive, of which there is no
              lack of examples. Thus <hi rend="italic">Tempest,</hi> I, i, 57, the substantive verb
              is left to be understood, albeit it had not been previously expressed, as
              &lsquo;The king and prince at prayers&rsquo;; and in the same play, I, i, 24,
              we have, &lsquo;to work the peace of <hi rend="italic">the

              <hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 616): It is said that for his revenge
              Coriolanus condescends to fawn upon Aufidius and the Volscians. This is not very
              plausible. His speech of greeting certainly shows no servile propitiation, and,
              according to Tullus, it is conspicuously absent in his subsequent behaviour. [The
              present lines quoted.] And elsewhere Tullus complains that his guest has
              &lsquo;waged him with his countenance,&rsquo; [V, vi, 45]. The only ground for
              saying that he paid court to the Volces is alleged in Tullus' speech that just
              precedes this accusation of haughtiness to himself, [V, vi, 27-30]. But the speaker is
              an enemy, and an enemy who has to account for the disagreeable circumstance that his
              own adherents have gone over to his rival, and who, moreover, at the time is looking
              for a plea that &lsquo;admits of good construction.&rsquo; There is nothing

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Craig</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>): What did Aufidius
              mean by this? After a very careful study of the Life of Coriolanus, in North, I am
              inclined to think that this is the explanation: The passage in Shakespeare's mind
              seems to have been that wherein it appears, that when the ambassadors came from Rome
              the first time to treat of peace, Coriolanus demanded that the Romans should
              &lsquo;restore unto the Volsces, all their landes and citties they had taken from
              them in former warres; and, moreover, that they should geve them the like honour and
              freedome of Rome, as they had before geven to the Latines.&rsquo; He gave them
              thirty days for answer and &lsquo;departed his armie out of the territories of the
              Romaines,&rsquo; and the relation goes on: &lsquo;This was the first matter
              wherewith the Volsces (that most envied Martius glorie and authoritie) dyd charge
              Martius with. Among those Tullus was chief; who though he had receyved no private
              injurie or displeasure of Martius, yet the common faulte and imperfection of man's
              nature wroght in him, and it grieved him to see his own reputation
              blemished,&rsquo; etc. A little later it continues: &lsquo;From hence they
              derived all their first accusations and secret murmurings against Martius. For private
              captaines . . . gave it out that the removing of the campe was a manifest
              treason,&rsquo; etc.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 619): This
              is, no doubt, suggested by the incident of the thirty days' truce, of which Plutarch
              makes so much and which Shakespeare totally suppresses. But the vague reference
              becomes all the more pregnant when we are to understand that Coriolanus has, at
              unawares and against his purpose, granted some little concessions to the victims of
              his wrath. That Aufidius' statement has some foundation is made probable by the words
              of the Antium Lord, who is no enemy to Marcius, but reproaches Tullus with his murder
              and reverently bewails his death: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;What faults he made before

            </p>
            <p>Faults, then, from the Volscian point of view, he has committed in the opinion of a
              sympathetic and impartial onlooker, which means that as a Roman he has shown
              forbearance. </p>

              against him there can possibly be made to urge. Thus the impending fall of Coriolanus
              is seen before the Fourth Act closes as hanging upon the hatred of the most powerful
              man among his new allies. The occasion to get the better of him, for which he hopes,

              it.&rsquo; Afterwards he says, &lsquo;When, Caius, Rome is thine, thou art

              difficult to say what charges Aufidius now means to bring against Coriolanus. He has
              not yet betrayed Antium by sparing Rome. In V, vi. no other definite accusation is
              made against him, though certain unspecified &lsquo;faults before the
              last&rsquo; are mentioned in V, vi, 79. [That which Coriolanus has left undone is,
              in the eyes of Aufidius, a due and proper recognition of all that has been accorded
              him by his quondam foe. Aufidius returns to this in V, vi, 25-45, and it is, I think,
              evident that his plan for the destruction of Coriolanus is here suggested; but the
              betrayal of the Antiates by Coriolanus causes Aufidius to drop the personal element,
              and merge it in the more serious charge of treason.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              some profound excellence in that in which I now appear to detect an

              foregoing remark, says: &lsquo;I cannot perceive the difficulty; the speech
              corresponds with the mixed character of the speaker, too generous not to see and
              admire his rival's merit, yet not sufficiently magnanimous to be free from the
              malignant desire of revenging himself upon his rival for that very
                superiority.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 657): Here
              there are puzzling expressions in detail, but they have, on the whole, been
              satisfactorily explained, and it is not to them that Coleridge refers. (Of these, the
              most perplexing to me is the distinction Shakespeare makes between &lsquo;the
              nobility,&rsquo; on the one hand, and &lsquo;the senators and
              patricians&rsquo; on the other. What was in his mind? I fail to find an
              explanation even on trying to render his thought in terms of contemporary arrangements
              in England. &lsquo;Peers,&rsquo; &lsquo;parliament men,&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;gentry&rsquo; would not do.) It strikes one indeed as a series of
              disconnected jottings that have as little to do with each other as with the situation
              and attitude of Aufidius. First he gives reasons for expecting the capture of Rome;
              then he enumerates defects in the character of Coriolanus that have led to his
              banishment with a supplementary acknowledgement of his merits; next he makes general
              reflections on the relation of virtue to the construction put upon it, and on the
              danger that lies in conspicuous power; thereafter he points out that things are
              brought to naught by themselves or their likes; and finally, he predicts that when
              Rome is taken he will get the better of his rival. Is there here a mere congeries of
              thoughts as one chance suggestion leads to another with which it happens to be
              casually associated, or does one continuous thread of meaning run through the whole? I
              would venture to maintain the latter opinion with more confidence than I do if
              Coleridge had not been so emphatic. In the first place, we have to remember what goes
              before. The report of the Lieutenant confirms the jealousy of Aufidius, who is further
              embittered by the thought that he is losing credit, but reflects that he can bring
              weighty charges against Coriolanus. Thereupon the Lieutenant meaningly rejoins:
              &lsquo;Think you he'll carry Rome?&rsquo; It is a contingency to be reckoned
              with, for clearly, if Rome falls, any previous mistakes or complaisances alleged
              against the conqueror will find ready pardon. So Aufidius discusses the matter in the
              light of these two main considerations: (1) that he must get rid of his rival, and (2)
              that his rival may do the state a crowning service. He admits that Coriolanus, what
              with his own efficiency, what with the friendliness of one class in Rome and the
              helplessness of the remainder, is likely to achieve the grand exploit. How then will
              Aufidius' chances stand? Formerly Marcius deserved as well of his own country when he
              had overthrown Corioli, yet that did not secure him. What qualities in himself
              discounted his services to Rome, and may again discount his services to Antium? Pride
              of prosperity, disregard of his opportunities, his unaccommodating peremptory
              behaviour&mdash;all of these faults which, in point of fact, afterward,
              contributed to his death&mdash;brought about his banishment, though truly he had
              merit enough to make men overlook such trifles. This shows how worth depends on the
              way it is taken, and how ability, even when of the sterling kind that wins its own
              approval, may find the throne of its public recognition to be, more properly, its
              certain grave. Thus likes counteract likes; the greater the popularity, the greater
              the reaction; the greater the superiority, the more certainly it will balk itself. So,
              and this is the conclusion of the whole matter, even when Marcius has won Rome by a
              greater </p>
            <p>conquest than when he won Corioli, the result will be the same. His proud, imprudent,
              and overbearing conduct will obscure his high deserts. These will be construed only by
              public opinion, and the very prowess in which he delights will rouse an adulation,
              which, when he is no longer required, will swing round to its opposite. So his success
              will correct itself. His very triumph over Rome will be guarantee for Aufidius'
              triumph over him. If this amplified paraphrase give the meaning, that meaning is
              coherent enough and is quite suitable to the mood and attitude of the
                speaker.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">E. K. Chambers</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Warwick Sh.</hi>): Surely Coleridge is right. The speech is out of keeping with
              Aufidius' mood in this scene. Perhaps the explanation is that it is not wholly
              dramatic; for once the dramatist, not the puppet, speaks. On the eve of the
              catastrophe Shakespeare pauses to sum up his hero's career so far.&mdash;<hi

              &lsquo;Hali&aelig;etus, clarissima oculorum acie, librans ex alto sese, viso
              in mari pisce, pr&aelig;ceps in mare ruens, et discussis pectore aquis,
              rapiens.&rsquo; It may not be disagreeable to go a little farther to explain the
              propriety of the Poet's allusion. Why will Coriolanus be to Rome as the Osprey to the
              fish: &lsquo;he'll take it By sovereignty of nature&rsquo;? Shakespeare, 'tis
              well known, has a peculiarity in thinking, and, whenever he is acquainted with nature,
              is sure to allude to her most uncommon effects and operations. I am very apt to
              imagine, therefore, that the poet meant Coriolanus would take Rome by the very opinion
              and terror of his name, as fish are taken by the Osprey through an instinctive fear
              they have of him. &lsquo;The fishermen&rsquo; (says our old naturalist,
              William Turner) &lsquo;are used to anoint their bait with osprey's </p>
            <p>fat, thinking thereby to make them the more efficacious; because when that bird is
              hovering in the air, all the fish that are beneath him (the nature of the eagle, as it
              is believed, compelling them to it) turn up their bellies and, as it were, give him
              his choice which he will take of them.&rsquo; Gesner goes a little farther in
              support of this odd instinct, telling us, &lsquo;that while this bird flutters in
              the air, and sometimes, as it were, seems suspended there, he drops a certain quantity
              of his fat, by the influence whereof the fish are so affrighted and confounded that
              they immediately turn themselves belly upward; upon which he sowses down
              perpendicularly like a stone, and seizes them in his talons.&rsquo; To this, I
              dare say, Shakespeare alludes in this expression of the &lsquo;Sovereignty of
              Nature.&rsquo; This very thought is again touched by Beaumont and Fletcher in
              their <hi rend="italic">Two Noble Kinsmen,</hi> a play in which there is a tradition

              principal cause of his exile, how could he be sure, and answer for it, that every one

              and partly to the mode in which &lsquo;it&rsquo; occurs in this clause of the
              sentence. In the clauses &lsquo;but he could not,&rsquo; &lsquo;but
              commanding peace,&rsquo; and &lsquo;but one of these&rsquo; the word
              &lsquo;but&rsquo; is used as a particle of objection; whereas in the last
              clause, &lsquo;but he has a merit,&rsquo; &lsquo;but&rsquo; seems to
              be used in the sense of &lsquo;however&rsquo; or
              &lsquo;nevertheless.&rsquo; After having enumerated the faults of character in
              Coriolanus Aufidius ends his sentence by the admission, &lsquo;Nevertheless, he
              has a merit,&rsquo; &amp;c. It is this last clause of admission which presents
              the chief difficulty; and we have to bear well in mind Shakespeare's peculiarities of
              style when trying to discover its precise meaning. Remembering these
              peculiarities&mdash;his very condensed expression and elliptical construction,
              together with his mode of using &lsquo;it,&rsquo; either to a just-named
              antecedent or to an implied particular&mdash;this clause may bear three
              interpretations: 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, &lsquo;However he has one merit, that of
              checking panegyric on it&rsquo; (his own merit). 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi>,
              &lsquo;Nevertheless, he has merit sufficient to stifle the decree of his
              banishment (implied in the previous words &lsquo;so banish'd&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;rash in the repeal,&rsquo; &lsquo;utterance&rsquo; in this case
              being taken to mean &lsquo;carrying out to the uttermost&rsquo;). 3<hi
                rend="sup">d</hi>, &lsquo;Nevertheless, he has a merit to quench what I have
              been uttering as to his faults&rsquo; (implied in &lsquo;one of these, as he
              hath spices of them all,&rsquo; &amp;c.). There is still a fourth
              interpretation that the clause will bear, which, considering the drift of the argument
              as carried out to the end of the speech, seems to be probably meant:
              &lsquo;However, he has a merit, a merit which destroys its own power by striving
              to assert that power.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Whitelaw</hi>: He did
              noble service as a soldier, and, though as a statesman, promoted for his service in
              the wars, he fell into disgrace, yet, confronted with the transcendent merit of the
              man (which only waits its opportunity, war, not peace), the very name of his fault
              must stick in the throats of his accusers.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi>
                (<hi rend="italic">Henry Irving Sh.</hi>): &lsquo;It&rsquo; may mean <hi
                rend="italic">detraction,</hi> or some such idea supplied from
              &lsquo;hated.&rsquo; If &lsquo;it&rsquo; refers to
              &lsquo;banishment,&rsquo; the sense must be &lsquo;which <hi rend="italic"
                >ought to have</hi> choked it in the utterance.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Deighton</hi>: Johnson's explanation seems to me to be the meaning,
              except that to &lsquo;utterance&rsquo; I would give the less restricted and
              older meaning of <hi rend="italic">publishing, displaying,</hi> not necessarily in an
              offensive way. The gist of the passage is that every good gift conferred upon him is
              counterbalanced by some weakness; he has raised himself to a high position by his
              valour, but his pride has marred his good fortune; he has, by his force of character,
              made himself master of great opportunities, but his defect of judgment has caused him
              to misuse those opportunities; he has the faculty of impressing men with his
              authority, but he cannot recognize the occasions on which that faculty should not be
              exercised; in every case some &lsquo;vicious mole of nature&rsquo; counteracts
              the qualities which would otherwise make his character so perfect. For a very similar

              explanations arises from the peculiar temper of Coriolanus, which renders them totally
              inapplicable to him in the sense which they give them; for he was so far from boasting
              of his exploits himself that he could not bear to hear them extolled by others; and we
              find that when his archenemy, Aufidius, sums up the defects of his character, that of
              boasting is not upon the list. The passage, indeed, is so very obscure that I cannot
              but think there is an error in it, and that we ought to read, &lsquo;But he has a
              merit to choak <hi rend="italic">him</hi> in the utterance&rsquo; instead of
              &lsquo;to choak it.&rsquo; What Aufidius means to say is: &lsquo;That his
              merit was so transcendent that the recital of it excited the envy and the
              apprehensions of the people; and that, therefore, the power with which it was
              accompanied had nothing that tended more surely to its destruction than the chair from
              which it was applauded.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Capell</hi> (vol. I,
              pt i, p. 97): The words &lsquo;So our virtue&rsquo; and the line after them
              are a general reflection upon the power of opinion over the
              &lsquo;virtues&rsquo; and endowments of all men, arising from the liberties
              which he himself had just taken with those of Coriolanus: 'tis opinion, says he,
              &lsquo;the interpretation of the time, that gives them their hue, and determines
              the degree of their goodness; and that opinion will sink them, pronounce sentence
              against them, if they are too loud in their own praise and niggards in commendation of
              others. Such is the connection between the parts of this speech, and such the tendency
              of the three difficult lines that precede the four riming ones. [Capell quotes with
              approval Warburton's paraphrase.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi

              justly observed, he has already been described as one who was so far from being a
              boaster that he could not endure to hear &lsquo;his nothings monster'd.&rsquo;
              But I rather believe &lsquo;in the utterance&rsquo; alludes not to Coriolanus
              himself, but to the <hi rend="italic">high encomiums pronounced on him by his
              friends;</hi> and then the lines of Horace may serve as a comment on the passage

            <p>A Passage in <hi rend="italic">Tro. &amp; Cress.,</hi> however, may be urged in

              public opinion that power, though derived from the purest source, finds not a surer
              instrument of destruction than the tongue of its panegyrist; a surer grave than the

              usually follows great actions; and, by extolling what has been done, confounds the

            <p>Sep., 1853, p. 323): This passage has given a good deal of trouble to the
              commentators. Aufidius is describing Coriolanus as a man who, with all his merits, had
              failed through some unaccountable perversity of judgment in attaining the position
              which his genius entitled him to occupy. Our virtues, says Aufidius, consist in our
              ability to interpret and turn to good account the signs of the times. And power, which
              delights to praise itself, is sure to have a downfall so soon as it blazons forth its
              pretensions from the <hi rend="italic">rostrum.</hi> The MS. Corrector proposes,
              &lsquo;&mdash;as a <hi rend="italic">cheer.</hi>&rsquo; The original text
              is obscurely enough expressed, but the new reading seems to be utter nonsense. What
                <hi rend="italic">can</hi> Mr Singer mean by his reading, &lsquo;Hath not a tomb

              of the manuscript notes of the Perkins Folio by means of a test-word was made by Mr A.
              E. Brae, of Leeds. His test-word was communicated to the editor of <hi rend="italic"
                >Notes and Queries</hi> and myself in 1853, and I made it public in my <hi

                rend="italic">tongue</hi> for &lsquo;tomb,&rsquo; wondering, with the
              reviewer of <hi rend="italic">The Athen&aelig;um,</hi> for August 20<hi rend="sup"
                >th</hi>, 1859, how a tomb can extol. Surely it is the <hi rend="italic">chair</hi>
              which is given to extol what the man of power and virtue has done! I should not wonder
              if some future Perkins should adopt all three suggestions and read, &lsquo;Hath
              not a <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> so <hi rend="italic">eloquent</hi> as a <hi
                rend="italic">cheer!</hi>&rsquo; I apprehend no intelligent person who reads the
              passage as corrected by Perkins will doubt for an instant that <hi rend="italic">a
                cheer</hi> is there intended to be understood in the sense <hi rend="italic">a shout
                of applause. . . .</hi> It struck Mr Brae that the word <hi rend="italic">cheer</hi>
              was necessarily employed in a modern sense, and immediately undertook a close
              examination of the chronology of the word <hi rend="italic">cheer</hi> and <hi
                rend="italic">cheers,</hi> the result of which with some of the details of the
              investigation he communicated to me. That result was that <hi rend="italic">a
              cheer,</hi> in the sense of <hi rend="italic">a shout of applause,</hi> was not in use
              till the present century, and that, consequently, it is a test-word which proves the
              manuscript notes of the Perkins Folio to be of recent origin. Nothing that has since
              been written upon the subject has in the slightest degree invalidated the soundness of
              this criticism. In the first place, I must call attention to the distinction between
              the use of <hi rend="italic">three cheers</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a cheer,</hi> in
              the sense of an audible expression of applause. Supposing that it could be shown that
              the phrase &lsquo;three&rsquo; cheers was employed to express shouts of
              applause before 1750, <hi rend="italic">and which I challenge the world of letters to
                prove,</hi> it might still happen that <hi rend="italic">a cheer</hi> was not so
              employed until 1800 or thereabouts, <hi rend="italic">which I challenge the world of
                letters to disprove.</hi> To confound <hi rend="italic">three cheers</hi> with <hi
                rend="italic">a cheer</hi> would be as ignorant a proceeding as to confound the
              phrases &lsquo;manning the yards&rsquo; and &lsquo;manning a
              yard.&rsquo; Before 1750 I find that <hi rend="italic">three cheers</hi> is a
              conventional phrase employed by sailors to express a naval salute. On the contrary,
                <hi rend="italic">a cheer</hi> did not mean anything of the kind; nor do I believe
              that any such a term was used by sailors till it became a land expression for a shout
              of applause, and that it did not do till the present century. [The foregoing, as
              Ingleby intimates, is an amplification of his remarks on this point as given in his
              earlier volume, <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare Fabrications,</hi> which appeared in
              1859. In the present work his discussion of the chronology of this test-word occupies
              twenty full pages with illustrative extracts. There is, I think, no need to give even
              a digest of these, as the <hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi> is now confirmatory of his
              contention that the word <hi rend="italic">cheer,</hi> in the sense of a shout of
              approbation, is quite modern. Finally, </p>
            <p>the question itself is one which concerns the MS. corrections in Collier's folio more
              nearly than the elucidation of the present passage as it appears in the Folio. For an
              excellent answer to Ingleby's remarks on this particular point see <hi rend="italic"
                >The Shakespeare Mystery, Atlantic Monthly,</hi> September, 1861, pp. 364,
                365.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Tycho
                Mommsen</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Der Perkins Folio,</hi> p. 239): Whatever special
              idea the word &lsquo;chair&rsquo; conveys in the sense of &lsquo;Orator's
              rostrum,&rsquo; whence continuous praise issues (naturally nothing more than
              self-praise), only gives obliquely and distantly the same idea which <hi rend="italic"
                >cheer</hi> gives plainly; at the same time &lsquo;chair&rsquo; is the more
              formative, and more nearly likened to a tomb, since we can think of the rostrum in the
              form of a pulpit. But such a weak comparison may have sufficed for the editor of the
              Folio&mdash;who quite misunderstood the passage&mdash;to introduce a half
              nonsensical word &lsquo;chair&rsquo;; just as the utterly senseless
              &lsquo;unto&rsquo; seems to have sprung from the stupid idea that
              &lsquo;commend&rsquo; [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], etc., connects its

              errors which make it so are those of a compositor who sets his

              and <hi rend="italic">cheer</hi> were formerly pronounced alike; and I have even heard
              some old people call a chair a <hi rend="italic">cheer.</hi> To this fact we owe the
              misprint of Macbeth's speech in Act V, sc. iii. This push &lsquo;Will chair (<hi

              Collier's folio very properly changes &lsquo;chair&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic"
                >cheer</hi> in this passage. But Mr Singer must pardon me for thinking his proposal
              deplorably tame and prosaic, even if it have any meaning at all. It is plain to me
              that Aufidius, after saying that &lsquo;our virtues lie in the <hi rend="italic"
                >inter pretation of the time</hi>&rsquo; (that is, in the time's appreciation of
              us, not in our appreciation of the time, as the writer in Blackwood seems to think),
              adds that the elaborate eulogy on a great man's tomb is a testimony to his power not
              so eloquent as a cheer to him in his lifetime. Few who write for the press can be
              fortunate enough not to know many compositors who would find no difficulty in setting
              up &lsquo;evident&rsquo; for &lsquo;eloquent.&rsquo; Long since it
              seemed plain to me that we should read, &lsquo;Hath not a tomb so <hi
                rend="italic">eloquent</hi> as a <hi rend="italic">cheer</hi> To extol what it hath
              done.&rsquo; [In the margin, against this, the former owner of the copy from which
              this note is taken, W. N. Lettsom, queries, &lsquo;What is an eloquent
                tomb?&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">ED.</hi>]&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">R. G. White</hi>, in his edition of this play which appeared nearly
              ten years later, agrees with Staunton that some lines &lsquo;have quite surely
              been lost&rsquo; after &lsquo;and so banish'd,&rsquo; l. 50. </p>
            <p>His interpretation of the present passage differs materially from that in his earlier
              work; he says: &lsquo;Aufidius is impressing upon his hearers [<hi rend="italic"
                >sic</hi>] the consequences of Coriolanus&rsquo; inflexible, impracticable
              nature. He tells them that our virtue, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> our moral power,
              lies in our appreciation of the time, our apprehension and mastery of the situation in
              which we are placed; and he adds, as a corollary, that power, arrogant of
              commendation, has not so sure, so manifest a grave as the seat of authority to which
              its deeds have raised it, and which its overweening egotism is likely to use in such a
              manner as to alienate those to whom it owes its elevation. There is not a comparison
              between a tomb and a <hi rend="italic">chair,</hi> but a likening of &ldquo;a
              chair to extol,&rdquo; &amp;c., to a tomb. The allusion is to the curule
              chair, which is very properly made a symbol of power in the state, as in the time of
              Coriolanus the right of sitting in it belonged to Consuls, Pr&aelig;tors,
              &AElig;diles, Flamens, and, of course, to Dictators. Shakespeare had read in
              North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch,</hi> &ldquo;There the Consul Cominius going up
              into his chayer of state in the presence of the army,&rdquo; &amp;c., ed.
              1579, p. 242. I was once of the opinion that Shakespeare meant Aufidius to utter a
              thought similar to that which is expressed by Bertram in <hi rend="italic">All's
              Well,</hi> I, ii, 48-51, <hi rend="bq"> &ldquo;His good remembrance, sir,<lb
                  rend="RIGHT"/> Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;<lb/> So in approof

              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>and therefore conjectured that we should read, &ldquo;Hath not a tomb so <hi
                rend="italic">eloquent</hi> as a <hi rend="italic">cheer</hi>&rdquo;<hi
                rend="italic">;</hi> and in Mr Collier's folio the latter word was found, but with
              the then incongruous &ldquo;evident&rdquo; left unchanged. This reading,
              however, although consistent with itself and appropriate to the occasion, is
              incongruous with the larger purpose of the speech, which is clearly indicated in the
              two lines ending &ldquo;strengths by strengths do
                fail.&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Keightley</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Expositor,</hi> p. 370): I agree with Steevens in regarding this
              passage and the comments on it as being equally unintelligible. The meaning seems to
              be one which Shakespeare frequently expresses (see <hi rend="italic">Tro. &amp;
                Cress.,</hi> I, iii.; II, iii.; III, iii.)&mdash;self-praise is no praise.
              &lsquo;Unto itself commendable&rsquo; is, then, standing high in the
              possessor's estimation. [Which, by the way, is merely a paraphrase of Warburton's
                explanation.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] The sense yielded by
              &lsquo;tomb&rsquo; and chair is most trivial, and I would, therefore, venture
              to propose, &lsquo;Hath not a <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> so evident as a <hi
                rend="italic">charmer's.</hi>&rsquo; Charms and spells, we know, were murmured
              or muttered in a low tone (&lsquo;wizards that peep and that mutter,&rsquo;
                <hi rend="italic">Isaiah,</hi> viii, 19); and if the final letters of <hi

              Warburton here seems to lose sight of the distinction between Virtue and Power; and

              of <hi rend="italic">the grave of Power,</hi> for Power ceases with life, the tomb is
              transferred to Virtue, whereby <hi rend="italic">tomb</hi> is made to bear the less
              usual sense of monumental epitaph or posthumous eulogy delivered as from a chair or a
              rostrum. The context, however, speaks of actual power, </p>
            <p>living, and in full exercise. To any such harsh mode of interpretation I should
              prefer venturing to treat the whole line as corrupt, and to amend the passage thus:
                <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;And Power, unto itself most commendable,<lb/> Hath <hi

              natural self-confidence, which is as an inward panegyric and commendation, never lacks
              the oratory of applauding multitudes to chime in with all its doings. [Wellesley, it
              is apparent, has failed utterly in comprehending Warburton's elucidation. There is

              the word for a band of singers, or a part of the church building, was uniformly spelt

              time of Shakespeare. Our spelling of the word, <hi rend="italic">choir,</hi> did not

              is to me undiluted nonsense. All the misdirected efforts of the critics have not been
              able to extract from it a consistent meaning, while the very difficulty of doing it
              proves the text to be corrupt. If we consider attentively what the speaker intended to
              say, we shall find it to this effect, that power, when its acts are intrinsically
              praiseworthy, does not meet with the slightest token of applause from the men of the
              time for what it has done; and to illustrate his sentiment he gives us, or designs to
              give us, an instance of something which notoriously makes a very faint demonstration
              in that way. As neither <hi rend="italic">a tomb</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">a
              chair</hi> can be considered as designating an instrument or medium for the
              contemporary laudation of meritorious acts of power, our task is to find two words
              which will denote what those words ought to denote with clearness, but do not, and, at
              the same time, so far resemble the actual reading as to render probable the
              substitution of the latter in the place of the former. The only suggestion with this
              view which I have happened to meet with at all entitled to serious discussion is the
              following, which is partly, at least, due to the Perkins folio: &lsquo;Hath not a
                <hi rend="italic">tone</hi> so evident as a <hi rend="italic">cheer.</hi>&rsquo;
              There are several strong objections to a reading which, at the first glance, appears
              so plausible. 1. <hi rend="italic">A cheer</hi> cannot, with any propriety, be called
              a tone. It may have a tone&mdash;<hi rend="italic">e. g.,</hi> it may be ironical,
              as the House of Commons knows, but it is not a tone itself. 2. <hi rend="italic">A
                cheer,</hi> which must be here construed as a general term, meaning the same as
              cheers, is a loud demonstration of applause, whereas the strain of the passage
              requires a feeble one to constitute the requisite antithesis between what is merited
              and what the least that could be given. 3. <hi rend="italic">Tone</hi> is a word never
              used by Shakespeare, and <hi rend="italic">cheer</hi> is never used by him in the
              modern sense of shout of approbation. The reading which I have to propose is as
              follows, &lsquo;Hath not a <hi rend="italic">trump</hi> so evident as a child's To
              extol what it has done.&rsquo; With our modern associations the word <hi
                rend="italic">trump,</hi> which is here the same in signification as <hi
                rend="italic">trumpet,</hi> may not at first be consonant with our feelings; the
              immediate idea presenting itself may be that of the trump of the card-table, with its
              figurative and slang applications, rather than the trump of fame. In Shakespeare's
              pages the term is used solely as the equivalent of trumpet. My proposed reading, after
              the first shock has been overcome, will probably be allowed to convert the line into
              good sense with that antithetical point and that spice of sarcasm which are </p>
            <p>requisite for the force of the passage. The degeneration of <hi rend="italic"
              >trump</hi> into <hi rend="italic">tomb</hi> and <hi rend="italic">child's</hi> into
                <hi rend="italic">chair,</hi> in the hands of copyists and compositors, is easily
              conceivable; while it exemplifies that insensibility to the meaning of the document
              before them into which both those classes of imitative manipulators have a perpetual
              tendency to fall. [Had Bailey but read with reasonable care Warburton's explanation he
              would, I think, hardly have made the mistake of paraphrasing l. 53, &lsquo;power,
              when its acts are intrinsically praiseworthy&rsquo;; and would not, assuredly,
              have connected both the words &lsquo;tomb&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;chair&rsquo; with the infinitive &lsquo;To extol.&rsquo; I may
              freely admit that I am not yet sufficiently recovered from the
              &lsquo;shock&rsquo; of Bailey's emendations to characterise them adequately;
              that task I gladly leave to the patient reader.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              criticism upon this passage in the least degree satisfactory, I leave it with the same
              remark as Steevens, and have nothing of my own to offer.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Leo</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> p. 125): In order to penetrate the
              poet's meaning and intention we must not examine a phrase, taken out of the intention
              of the scene, but we must feel with the acting persons, and out of this feeling we
              must know how they think and how they speak. And, therefore, let us now become
              Aufidius for a moment, and see whether it might be possible for us to think on the
              &lsquo;chair,&rsquo; the sella curilis in Rome, and reflect on things which do
              not stand in any relation to the passionate feelings of envy and revenge which
              dominate us. Aufidius feels quite well that he has lost his position as the first
              general of the Volces, and that his glory is darkened by Coriolanus; he hates him, and
              has the clear intention to ruin him so clear that he knows already his way and means
              to do it. Though Coriolanus is hated by him and some other Volscian Generals, he is
              not hated by the people, and to make him so must be the first step. Aufidius knows
              that, though small merits are willingly acknowledged, people do not like to be
              reminded of great and important merits, which lay them under the obligation of
              gratitude, and that he who is idolized is nearest to be hated as soon as he himself
              mentions his deeds. &lsquo;He has a merit (great enough) to choke it in the
              utterance,&rsquo; and, therefore, he provokes Coriolanus, in V, vi, and hopes that
              in his fury he will boast of what he has done for the Volscian people, and that the
              &lsquo;fire&rsquo; of his merits will be driven out by the
              &lsquo;fire&rsquo; of the people's pride. But that does not lie in the nature
              of Coriolanus, and by going just the contrary way, and hurting the self-love and
              vanity of the Volces in reminding them of the origin of his name of Coriolanus, he
              facilitates for Aufidius the attainment of his purpose. But that is a fact, though it
              is of a stirring dramatic effect (Coriolanus perishing in Antium by the same contempt
              of the people as in Rome) which has nothing to do with the former combinations of
              Aufidius. He intends to provoke Coriolanus to become his own panegyrist, and so he
              says: <hi rend="bq"> &lsquo;Power, unto itself most commendable,<lb/> Has not a
                tomb so evident as a <hi rend="italic">claim</hi><lb/> To extol what it has

            <p><hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> &lsquo;If he, who has merits, claims the extolment
              of his deeds, his power is lost,&rsquo; and, therefore, I propose not to read

              &lsquo;chair&rsquo; is better than <hi rend="italic">claim,</hi> because it
              gives the same sense in a more poetical form. The juxtaposition of

            <p>materially a greater right and chance of becoming possibly a tomb than a claim ever
              could&mdash;is just what a poet writes, while a scrutinizing critic afterwards
              alters &lsquo;chair&rsquo; to the very correct, but very prosaical, <hi
                rend="italic">claim. Claim</hi> says all, and, therefore, does not say

                rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi>): We think the passage as it stands means,
              &lsquo;Our virtues lie at the mercy of popular interpretation in our own day; and
              power, ever anxious to exact commendation, has no tomb so sure as the pulpit of
              eulogium which extols its deeds.&rsquo; It must be borne in mind that here
              &lsquo;chair&rsquo; is used for the public rostrum, cathedra, or pulpit,
              whence orations, laudatory or otherwise, were delivered to the Roman
                people.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">P. A. Daniel</hi> (p. 63): Qy, read this

            <p>Mitford first conjectured that <hi rend="italic">chaire</hi> should be <hi
                rend="italic">care.</hi> Taken as a whole, however, the reading I suggest has not, I
              believe, been proposed before. The following passages may be quoted by way of
              illustration: &lsquo;For then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of
              our deservings, when of ourselves we publish them,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">All's
                Well,</hi> I, iii, 5-7. &lsquo;He that is proud eats up himself: pride is his
              own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle; and whatever praises itself but in the
              deed, devours the deed in the praise,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Tro. &amp;
                Cress.,</hi> II, iii, 149-152.&mdash;Rev. <hi rend="smallcap">John Hunter</hi>:
              So whether anything will be accounted virtuous in us depends on the appropriateness of
              the time in which we show it. And power, which justifies itself to itself as being
              thoroughly deserved, has not so sure a tomb, or means of extinction, as when it is
              placed in a seat of dignity intended to exalt, or glorify, its
                achievements.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Whitelaw</hi>: Our virtues are virtues
              no longer if the time interprets them as none. The soldier who is all soldier is
              misinterpreted in time of peace; for his unfitness for peace is seen, his fitness for
              war is not seen. So Coriolanus&mdash; the power he had won in war but wielded in
              peace, conscious of having deserved well, could <hi rend="italic">to itself</hi>
              commend itself, but the chair of authority, which irritated the people by seeming to
              do nothing else but commend his past exploits <hi rend="italic">to them,</hi> proved
              just the tomb&mdash;the evident, inevitable tomb&mdash;that swallowed up the
              power it intended to display. So he offended the Romans when he had taken Corioli;
              much more will he offend the Volscians when he has taken Rome.&mdash; <hi
                rend="smallcap">Schmidt</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>): Perhaps we should
              place a comma after &lsquo;chair,&rsquo; and interpret &lsquo;to
              extol,&rsquo; etc., If it (power) speaks in high terms of former deeds.&mdash;
                <hi rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi>: Though obscurely expressed, the general sense
              of this passage seems to be, Our reputation must be left for our contemporaries to
              decide. (The expression is here emphatic, for the point on which Aufidius insists is
              the forgetfulness of the populace and their ingratitude for past services.) The
              orator's chair from which a man extols his own actions is the inevitable tomb of that
              power, however deserving, which is the subject of praise.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi> (ed. ii.): I am now thoroughly satisfied that the old
              text is right; or that, if any change is wanted, it should be &lsquo;Hath <hi
                rend="italic">ne'er</hi> a tomb.&rsquo; And I am indebted for this, in the first
              instance, to Mr Joseph Crosby; though I since find that Staunton and Whitelaw have
              given substantially the same solution of the difficulty. The changes made and </p>
            <p>proposed have all proceeded upon the supposal that the construction is,
              &lsquo;Hath not a tomb to extol&rsquo;; whereas the construction is
              &lsquo;a chair to extol,&rsquo; that is, &lsquo;a chair <hi rend="italic"
                >that extols.</hi>&rsquo; With this key to the meaning the old text is readily
              seen to be right. . . . The speaker's argument is that Coriolanus, by his arrogance
              and tyranny in peace, will surely and speedily kill the popularity he has gained in
              war. And so the meaning here is that power, joined to a haughty, domineering temper,
              and loved and gloried in, for its own sake, <hi rend="italic">hath no grave so
                certain,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">imminent, as a chair of state bestowed in honour
                and extolment of its deeds.</hi> Or, to put the matter in concrete form, let
              Coriolanus, with his habits of military prerogative, and of lording it over all about
              him, be once advanced to a place of civil authority, and he will soon become an object
              of public hatred; so that the very seat which rewards and blazons his exploits, will
              be sure to prove his ruin and the tomb of his power.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Beeching</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Henry Irving Sh.</hi>): This may mean either
              &lsquo;virtues are not virtues unless acknowledged to be such by our
              contemporaries,&rsquo; or, more probably, &lsquo;our virtues become vices if
              they are mistimed.&rsquo; Coriolanus's soldier-like virtues became vices when he
              recognized no distinction between what was appropriate to war and peace. [The next
              passage may be interpreted], &lsquo;Power, when it is entirely self-satisfied,
              finds, in general, no readier grave than the right of praising itself.&rsquo;
              &lsquo;Chair&rsquo; seems to mean <hi rend="italic">magistrate's chair.</hi>
              and so &lsquo;authority.&rsquo; The sense of the passage is that power may
              lose itself by being boastful; but there is very probably some corruption of the text.
              [Beeching, in his notes prepared for the <hi rend="italic">Falcon Edition</hi> a year
              or so later, gives the following alternative interpretation: &lsquo;The difficulty
              of this passage arises from an uncertainty whether it is said in praise or blame of
              Coriolanus. In the former case the sense is, &ldquo;Time, the great interpreter,
              reveals our virtues (notwithstanding banishment, etc.); and power which appreciates
              its own desert will not find so conspicuous a monument as a public chair from which it
              may be praised.&rdquo; Taken this way, the passage connects with &ldquo;he has
              a merit,&rdquo; etc., making the contrast of l. 57 sharper; and it preserves the
              Shakespearian sense of <hi rend="italic">tomb</hi> = &ldquo;monument&rdquo;),
              as in <hi rend="italic">Henry V:</hi> I, ii, 228, &ldquo;Or lay these bones in an
              unworthy urn, Tombless, with no remembrance over them.&rdquo; Also, &ldquo;the
              interpretation of (= by) the time&rdquo; is construed as the same phrase
              afterwards (V, iii, 76).&rsquo; Beeching then gives his former note as the
              interpretation in blame of Coriolanus.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              that the <hi rend="italic">chair of office,</hi> which silently proclaims a man's

              exaltation accelerates his precipitation; from the pinnacle to the pit is but a
                step.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Kinnear</hi> (p. 329): The meaning of the
              passage is, And power, as to itself most praiseworthy, has no tomb so certain as the

              same public chair that pronounced the panegyric, utters the sentence of banishment or
                death.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">G. Joicey</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Notes

              &lsquo;as a chair,&rsquo; be a mistake for &lsquo;as such air&rsquo;?
              Aufidius seems to mean that, since our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time,

              our very virtues are subject to the judgments passed on them by the age in which we

            <p>finds its surest means of destruction in the pulpit from which it proclaims its own
              exploits. Malone objects that &lsquo;our author&rsquo; has represented
              Coriolanus as not being able to hear his brave deeds mentioned, and that, therefore,
              he could not here speak of him as a boaster. But it is not &lsquo;our
              author&rsquo; who thus speaks, but Aufidius, whose spoken opinions of Coriolanus
              are not always founded on knowledge or sincerity.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              &lsquo;chair&rsquo; means either the chair of the panegyrist or the chair of
              the magistrate. &lsquo;Not a tomb so evident as a chair&rsquo; is surely a way
              of saying &lsquo;no tomb at all,&rsquo; &lsquo;not a wooden chair, much
              less a sumptuous seated statue.&rsquo; Then &lsquo;unto itself&rsquo; I
              take as &lsquo;in itself,&rsquo; an odd construction, but formed from
              &lsquo;to give commendation unto virtues.&rsquo; The whole passage is a
              general moral drawn from Coriolanus's fate in Rome, suggested by the thought of his
              merit just referred to in l. 50. I paraphrase: &lsquo;Coriolanus was meritorious,
              but merit is as our contemporaries choose to think it. A man may have power and
              deserve commendation, yet, if his fellow-citizens choose, he may be blotted out, and
              not the slightest monument left to speak his praise.&rsquo; The kind of sentiment
              is that so often put in the mouth of a Greek chorus.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">W.

              >d</hi> May, 1890): The whole sense of this passage comes out at once by simply
              calling to mind that <hi rend="italic">chair,</hi> in Tudor English, was sometimes
              used in the sense of &lsquo;pulpit.&rsquo; Milton has it so; see
              &lsquo;Chair&rsquo; in the <hi rend="italic">N. E. D.,</hi> sect. 5. Cotgrave
              has: &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Chaire,</hi> f. a Chair; also a pulpit for a
              preacher.&rsquo; And in modern French it still has this sense, as distinct from
              its doublet, <hi rend="italic">chaise.</hi> And this is the solution of the whole
              matter. The idea might have been picked up in any church, for, indeed, the pulpit is
              commonly more &lsquo;evident,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi>
              conspicuous, than any of the fine tombs in the choir. The general sense is just this:
              &lsquo;Power, however commendable it may seem to itself, can find no tomb so
              conspicuous, no tomb so obvious, as when it chooses for itself a pulpit whence to
              proclaim its own praises.&rsquo; This agrees very nearly with the explanation in
              the note to the Clarendon Press edition [W. A. Wright]; but it seems to be more
              emphatic and picturesque to explain the word as &lsquo;pulpit&rsquo; than
              merely as &lsquo;orator's chair.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Herford</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Eversley Sh.</hi>): Our reputation for virtue is in
              the hands of our contemporaries; and power, confident of its own merits, has no more
              obvious road to ruin than by proclaiming them. This, I think, the clear
                sense.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's
              Sh.</hi>): Aufidius has been saying that Coriolanus, in spite of his noble services to
              the State, has been brought down by some failing which set his fellow-countrymen
              against him. This leads (&lsquo;so&rsquo;) to the general reflection that
              every man, however great, is conditioned by public opinion, and that self-laudation,
              above all in the highly-placed, is suicidal. [Verity cites Malone's objection to the
              accusation of self-praise urged against Coriolanus, and refutes it in substantially
              the same manner as does Page.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] The obscurity
              and metre of lines 51-53, the uncertainty in l. 57, and the poor rhymes in 56-59
              combine to suggest that some corruption of the whole passage has taken place. But of
              many emendations, none is at all taking. Note that &lsquo;<hi rend="italic"
              >the</hi> time&rsquo; is Shakespeare's constant phrase for &lsquo;the
              age,&rsquo; &lsquo;one's contemporaries.&rsquo; I do not think that it is
              possible to interpret, &lsquo;Time, the great interpreter, reveals our
              virtues,&rsquo; as if Shakespeare had written &lsquo;time&rsquo; alone
              (not &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">the</hi> time&rsquo;). &lsquo;Lie
              in&rsquo;=&lsquo;to be in the power of, to depend on,&rsquo; is </p>
            <p>a common Shakespearian use.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Stanley Wood</hi>: The
              general sense of this seems to me to be as follows, A man's greatness depends not so
              much upon his character or his acts, as upon people's judgment of them. Coriolanus's
              power in Rome, intrinsically great and worthy of all praise (unto itself=in itself),
              has been reduced to nothing because the praises which were showered upon him by the
              Senate and the nobles were offensive to the people and the Tribunes, whose
              interpretation of his merits has prevailed. This explanation assumes that Aufidius
              knew what course events had taken in Rome, a reasonable assumption considering his
              recent association with Coriolanus.&mdash;Miss <hi rend="smallcap">C. Porter</hi>
                (<hi rend="italic">First Folio Sh.</hi>): Only let it be that the virtue or ability
              in us is equal to understanding the right moment, let it but co-ordinate itself with
              the occasion, <hi rend="italic">lie in th' interpretation of the time,</hi> and then
              the power that is most alone in being merely to itself commendable hath no <hi
                rend="italic">Tombe</hi> and epitaph, not a monument, as it were, so ready with
              praise of past achievements as it has a <hi rend="italic">Chaire,</hi> or throne for
              them which shall be a new seat of life and honor. Aufidius is moralizing as to Martius
              with himself in mind. He is applying the virtue that in Martius turned banishment into
              a new sort of triumph for him, to his own present crisis, due to Martius, when he must
              await the ripe moment to turn the present obscuration, practically the <hi
                rend="italic">Tombe,</hi> of his ability into a new exposition, or throne, of it. As
              Martius had the strength to strangle, as it were, in its utterance the sentence
              against himself, and make it recoil on those who pronounced it, so he would do. Only
              let his virtue come out in the interpreting of the time or right occasion, and his
              power, most commendable now unto itself alone, will have not dead and gone honors so
              obviously as a new seat of homage. This passage has generally been accounted extremely
              obscure and difficult. . . . To us it seems not corrupt, but introspective. It is
              characteristic of Shakespeare's most darkly brooding impersonations. The creature of
              his dramatic scheme in this case is suffering from a self-caused depreciation of
              himself. It stings him to mental processes born of competition with a nature his own
              different nature emulates, and understands while plotting to surmount.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Gordon</hi>: The meaning is, that power, which is naturally most
              pleasing to itself, is never so obviously near its grave as when (speech succeeding to
              action) the time comes to pronounce a laudation of its achievements.
              &lsquo;Chair&rsquo; means a chair of state from which official pronouncements
              are made. Most editors that I have seen go wrong on this passage. They have a picture
              of self-satisfied &lsquo;power&rsquo; openly extolling itself, and are
              naturally puzzled to see how this can apply to Coriolanus, who notoriously hated brag.
              But &lsquo;unto itself most commendable&rsquo; does not mean that power is
              self-satisfied; it means that power always seems more satisfactory to the person who
              possesses it than to those who do not. And it is nowhere said that power extols
              &lsquo;itself.&rsquo; The passage must be taken in connexion with what goes
              before, or the sense is lost. Aufidius has just said that no matter what your merits
              and achievements may be, everything depends on how your contemporaries take them. He
              goes on to add that there is nothing more risky for a man who has done great things
              than when the time comes to have them proclaimed. People may take such praise either
              way. If they take it one way, he's a hero, and the saviour of the state; if they take
              it the other, he's a traitor and a tyrant. The application to Coriolanus is
                plain.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">S. P. Sherman</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Tudor
              Sh.</hi>): The meaning is that we cannot be judges of our own virtues; they must be
              stamped with the approval of the society in which we live before they can become
              current. Shake</p>

              &lsquo;our virtues depend (for their efficacy) upon the way in which they are

              their efficacy) upon the manner in which we interpret, and adapt ourselves to,
              surrounding circumstances.&rsquo; The latter view agrees better with the
              explanation I have given of ll. 50, 51 [<hi rend="italic">q. v.</hi>], but it is
              doubtful whether &lsquo;the interpretation&rsquo; can mean &lsquo;the
              interpretation we put.&rsquo; If the reading of ll. 51-55 is genuine, the meaning
              probably is, &lsquo;and power (<hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> a man in high
              position), however much it may consider itself deserving of praise, has no such
              certain grave of its reputation as a chair from which it pronounces its own
                eulogy.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Arden
                Sh.</hi>): I am inclined to interpret this passage in close connection with <hi
                rend="italic">the beginning of the speech,</hi> and to regard it as a general
              reflection referring quite as much, or more, to the Tribunes as to Coriolanus, to whom
              it is always confined. Aufidius has declared that the people will recall Coriolanus as
              eagerly as they expelled him, and after a digression as to the causes of his overthrow
              and a tribute to his merit, he proceeds to this effect. Thus the light in which our
              virtues are regarded depends upon the time (the fluctuation of popular opinion which
              then denounced Coriolanus and will now acclaim him), and power, however
              self-justified, finds a grave in the very seat of authority whence it extols its
              actions. What Aufidius describes had, in fact, happened in the last scene, when the
              grave of their power opened before the Tribunes at the very height of their
              self-congratulations, and &lsquo;the interpretation of the time&rsquo; begins
              to change rapidly under the face of circumstances. So, too, the proverbs that follow
              refer to the former reverse and that in progress; perhaps also to the final reverse of
              all, but Aufidius does not take up that subject till he has ended his reflections and
              prepared to go. Then, still thinking first of Coriolanus's triumph, he says,
              &lsquo;When, Caius, Rome is thine,&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Tucker
                Brooke</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Yale Shakespeare</hi>): Power, though (when
              considered absolutely) most worthily attained, is never so near its grave as when the
              successful man, seated in the chair of authority, seeks to justify the means by which
              he has risen. [I am somewhat loath to add any words of mine to this long note. I wish,
              however, to call attention to the <hi rend="italic">Text. Notes,</hi> wherein it will
              be noticed how negligible has been the influence of any of the proposed alterations of

              are obscure, and some of them nonsensical. [It will be noticed that the reading which
              Mason commends is that of Pope; it is to be feared that he had not examined the

              Aufidius, and not to the preceding observations concerning the illeffects of
              extravagant encomiums. It is manifest that Aufidius would never represent his own
              cause or rights as <hi rend="italic">fouler,</hi> or less worthy than the rights of
              Coriolanus, and that what he here means to say is, &lsquo;As one fire cures

              ear. Thus one part of the line corresponds and is in opposition with the other; and,
              instead of no sense, a clear and consistent meaning is obtained. [It is to be deplored
              that Malone hesitated to admit that this emendation is Johnson's, and not his own. It
              is hardly credible that Malone was unaware of this; Johnson's note is given in both
              the Variorum of 1773 and of 1778, as well as in his own edition.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] This verb [<hi rend="italic">founder</hi>] is used
              precisely with the same metaphorical signification in a passage in <hi rend="italic"
                >Henry VIII.,</hi> which fully supports the present emendation in this point,
              &lsquo;All his tricks founder; and he brings his physic After his patient's
              death,&rsquo; [III, ii, 40]. The notions suggested in the text were extremely
              familiar to Shakespeare, and occur in various places in his works. Thus in <hi
                rend="italic">Venus &amp; Adonis,</hi> &lsquo;Strong-tempered steel his
              stronger strength obeyed,&rsquo; [l. 111]. Again in <hi rend="italic">Henry
              V:</hi> &lsquo;Think we King Henry strong And, princes, look you strongly arm to
              meet him,&rsquo; [II, iv, 48]. Again in <hi rend="italic">King John,</hi>
              &lsquo;Controlment for controlment; so answer France,&rsquo; [I, i, 20]. Again
              in <hi rend="italic">Venus &amp; Adonis,</hi> &lsquo;The iron bit he crusheth
              'tween his teeth, Controlling what he was controlled with,&rsquo; [ll. 269, 270].
              Again, in <hi rend="italic">Richard III,</hi> &lsquo;rights for rights Hath dimm'd
              his infant morn to aged night,&rsquo; [IV, iv, 15. Malone concludes this rather
              long note with a verbose repetition of his reluctance to admit innovations into the
              original text, urging as an extenuating reason that, as his predecessors had
              frequently done so, he feels that he should, at least, be accorded a like privilege
              where the text is manifestly corrupt.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              proverb, &lsquo;York doth foul Sutton,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi>

              Steevens's explanation as though it applied to the Folio reading, which, as will be
              noticed, Steevens distinctly hesitated to attempt on account of its obscurity. His
              interpretation refers to Pope's amendments in the line. As to Singer's reading, <hi

              the perspicacious reader may see for himself Malone's appropriation of Johnson's
              emendation so far from provoking controversy, was greeted with complete silence by
              Steevens and Ritson. Boswell merely remarks faintly that he does not

                &amp; M. Cowden Clarke</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi>):
              &lsquo;Fouler&rsquo; has been changed under the idea that a verb is required
              in this place, but it appears to us that Shakespeare, in this line as elsewhere, makes
              one verb do double duty in a sentence; and here the meaning is, &lsquo;Rights by
              rights fouler do fail, strengths by strengths do fail.&rsquo; See a very similar
              passage in <hi rend="italic">Timon,</hi> IV, iii, 28, &lsquo;This much of this
              will make black, white; foul, fair; wrong, right; base, noble; old, young; coward,
              valiant&rsquo;; where the verb &lsquo;make&rsquo; before
              &lsquo;black&rsquo; gives &lsquo;make&rsquo; to be understood as
              repeated before &lsquo;foul,&rsquo; &lsquo;wrong,&rsquo;
              &lsquo;base,&rsquo; &lsquo;old,&rsquo; &lsquo;coward,&rsquo;
              thus doing multiplied duty in the sentence. In the present passage the word
              &lsquo;fouler&rsquo; bears the sense of <hi rend="italic">less fair</hi> or
                <hi rend="italic">more unfair,</hi> as Shakespeare more than once uses the common
              expression &lsquo;foul play&rsquo; for <hi rend="italic">unfair practice,</hi>
              and uses the word &lsquo;foully&rsquo; for <hi rend="italic">unfairly</hi> in
                <hi rend="italic">All's Well,</hi> V, iii, 154, &lsquo;I am afeard the life of

              >Schmidt</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>): Certain editors have altered
              &lsquo;fouler&rsquo;; but why should Shakespeare not have said that wrong
              comes to pass through wrong, and often the better through the worse?&mdash; <hi
                rend="smallcap">Whitelaw</hi>: &lsquo;Fouler&rsquo; has been altered in a
              variety of ways, but may, after all, be right, and is at least as good as the
              conjectures. The meaning seems to be, &lsquo;Rights yield to
              rights&mdash;often the fairer to the fouler&mdash;when strength yields to
              strength. It is the superior strength not the better right that wins.&rsquo;

                >Hudson</hi> (ed. i.) accepts Collier's MS. cor</p>
            <p>rection as &lsquo;seeming, on the whole, preferable to the others; though <hi
                rend="italic">founder</hi> strikes us as a very plausible emendation.&rsquo;
              [Hudson, following his predecessors, gives it to Malone. In his ed. ii. Hudson adopts
              the original text, whereon he has this note: &lsquo;The meaning of this line
              expressed in full, probably is that the better rights succumb to the worse, and the
              nobler strengths to the meaner, the sense of <hi rend="italic">fail</hi> being
              anticipated in the first clause, and that of <hi rend="italic">fouler</hi> continued
              over the second. Here, as elsewhere, Aufidius is fully conscious of the foulness of
              his purposes. The only thing he cares for is to get a sure twist on his antagonist. .
              . . Dyce observes &ldquo;That a verb lies concealed under <hi rend="italic"
              >fouler</hi> is undubitable.&rdquo; But this is far from being indubitable to me;
              I believe the old text to be right.&rsquo;&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap"
                >Halliwell</hi>: The only emendations worth noting are <hi rend="italic"
              >founder,</hi> suggested by Johnson, and <hi rend="italic">falter,</hi> proposed and
              adopted by Dyce. On the whole I prefer the first suggestion, believing that

              The extreme corruption of this play warrants, in fact, requires, unusual freedom of
              conjecture in regulating the text. [White in his enumeration of the various readings

              that a verb is required to balance &lsquo;fail.&rsquo; <hi rend="italic"
                >Falter,</hi> proposed by Dyce, seems to us the best of the various

              Shakespeare might have picked up the word from barge-men on the Avon. [This last
              supposition is quite impossible; &lsquo;foul,&rsquo; in the sense suggested by

              probable that &lsquo;fouler&rsquo; represents &lsquo;foulter&rsquo; in
              the manuscript. The latter word may be found in Florio's Montaigne, Bk ii, ch. viii,

              lame, foulter, and breed a scoffe.&rsquo; [This word does not appear to be known

              think it a misprint for the form <hi rend="italic">faulter,</hi> given by Dyce for <hi

              >grow</hi> or <hi rend="italic">become</hi> is conceivable; but <hi rend="italic"
                >founder,</hi> as the nearest suggestion, is here adopted because the idea of
              complete overthrow is needed. The fire, the nail, strengths are each totally
              overpowered; so too must rights be, and not merely weakened.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Gordon</hi>: These general reflections close, according to
              Shakespeare's habit, in a proverbial couplet. All the proverbs convey one meaning:
              that power falls by stirring up inevitably another power to oppose it. So Coriolanus
              has fallen once, at the height of his achievement, by the opposition of the people; so
              he will fall again, at the height of his new achievement, by the opposition of
                Aufidius.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Deighton</hi>: Rights give way to other and
              better rights; power, however great, has to yield when it meets greater power. [As
              Deighton adopts Dyce's conjecture in his text, the foregoing is an explanation and
              justification of Dyce rather than an attempt to explain Shakespeare's text. I cannot
              convince myself that any change in the Folio is either necessary or desirable. As the
              Cowden Clarkes so ably demonstrate, this elliptical form of expression is eminently
              characteristic of Shakespeare, particularly in the later plays; besides, the sentiment
              is also characteristic of Aufidius. In I, x. he had declared that nothing should
              restrain him in the satisfying of his hatred for Marcius. The rights of host to guest,
              the prayers of priests which ordinarily restrain fury, shall be by him disregarded.
              For Aufidius to make such a general statement that rights falter or founder by other
              rights is both inconsistent to the situation and weakening to his

              fore-stage, and, as we may guess, the </p>
            <p>entry of the group was made from the end of the outer-stage (either right or left of
              the rear-stage compartment). This entrance stands all through the play for most of the
              Roman localities, as the &lsquo;Cyprus grove&rsquo; side, opposite, stood, all
              through, for the open country and the out-of-Rome localities. When Menenius goes on
              his errand (l. 73) perhaps he made his exit through the &lsquo;Cyprus
              grove.&rsquo; The dialogue, after he leaves, gives space of time enough for the
              audience to suppose him on his way, and when the Roman group goes off (l. 86) as it
              had entered, then, at the point marked now as Scene II, Menenius appeared again from
              the &lsquo;Cyprus grove&rsquo; side, and, approaching the rear-stage or tent
              of Coriolanus, held his parley with the two men on guard who barred his progress (see

              &lsquo;wrack'd&rsquo; is merely the old (and not very unusual) spelling of

              much propriety in the exclamation, and so very little in the expression of <hi

              disturbed. But Mr Dyce is not so successful in defending the old reading, nor, as I
              think, in interpreting &lsquo;wracked&rsquo; as equivalent to <hi
                rend="italic">racked</hi> in our modern orthography; for though his note is
              conclusive as to the old practice of confounding the spelling of the two words, it is
              impossible to attach any sense to the expression, <hi rend="italic">who have racked
                for Rome.</hi> A transposition restores the only meaning which Menenius can be

              once belonged to Rome; and all this only to make coals cheap in the burning city. The

              Richardson, &lsquo;The court of affection, held by that racking steward,

                &lsquo;rack-rents.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Perring</hi>:
              &lsquo;Wracked&rsquo; is the word which is set down in the Folios, and,
              inasmuch as our word &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">wrecked,</hi>&rsquo; wherever it
              occurs, is almost invariably spelt in the original copies with an &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">a</hi>&rsquo; and not with an &lsquo;<hi rend="italic"
              >e,</hi>&rsquo; the presumption is that &lsquo;wrecked&rsquo; is the word
              which is here authorized by the Folios. The meaning would be that the tribunes had (to
              borrow words from <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>) &lsquo;laboured in their
              country's wreck.&rsquo; The preposition &lsquo;for,&rsquo; coming after
              &lsquo;wreck,&rsquo; would be abnormal, but not necessarily un-Shakespearian.
              It might be illustrated by such expressions as the following: &lsquo;Revenge the
              heavens for old Andronicus,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Titus And.,</hi> IV, i, 129;

              own contribution, as he takes pains to elucidate this new reading thus:
              &lsquo;They had wreaked their vengeance on Coriolanus by expatriating him, under
              colour that it was for the public good; but what had they effected? They had cheapened
              coals! and cheap enough they would be when the city was, as it were, the colliery to
              supply the fuel for its own conflagration; the allusion, of course, is to Coriolanus
              having refused to be called by any title, &ldquo;Till he had forged himself a name
              o'the fire Of burning Rome.&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              Sh.</hi>): That is, striven, strained. Menenius ridicules the net result of their
              strenuous efforts on behalf of the common weal, viz., a fall in the price of coals.
              The metaphor is &lsquo;to strain, wrest,&rsquo; as by means of a rack or
              instrument.&mdash;Miss <hi rend="smallcap">C. Porter</hi> (<hi rend="italic">First

              Menenius makes words suit his meaning in their suggestive sense. Here in
              &lsquo;wrack'd&rsquo; he seems to have combined the sense of wrought ruin, and
              wreaked vengeance in a way according with the usage of &lsquo;wrecked&rsquo;
              and &lsquo;wreake&rsquo; (see IV, vi, 90). And the words used by Plutarch at
              this stage of the story are again in point here, &lsquo;In this while, all went
              still to wrack at Rome.&rsquo; As before explained by editors, merely in the sense
              of &lsquo;laboured&rsquo; or &lsquo;wrought&rsquo; the entire meaning
              conveyed by the passage seems not to be covered.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              16): There are several reasons for doubting the soundness of this passage. The
              halfline by itself would excite no suspicion, for there is a natural pause after the
              words &lsquo;what then?&rsquo; [This half-line, &lsquo;Unheard; what
              then?&rsquo; is due to Pope, see <hi rend="italic">Text. Notes.</hi>] When,
              however, we find the next line beginning with &lsquo;but,&rsquo; a conjunction
              which has nothing to do with the preceding clause, we cannot help suspecting that
              there is an hiatus to be supplied with some such words as these, &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">not as a joyful herald, But</hi> as a discontented friend,&rsquo;
              &amp;c. If this be thought too bold, &lsquo;But&rsquo; must be at once
              discarded; and we are the more inclined to adopt this alternative because it will also
              enable us to change the expression of &lsquo;discontented friend,&rsquo; which
              is somewhat unusual in the sense of a friend who has had his request denied, and to
              get rid of the Alexandrine in the following line. We propose, therefore, to read: <hi
                rend="bq"> &lsquo;As a <hi rend="italic">discountenanc'd</hi> friend grief-shot
                with his<lb/> Unkindness.<lb/>

            <p>[Ten years later, that is, in 1856, Badham returns to the question of the proper
              arrangement of these lines. In that interval he has evidently repaired his omission of
              consulting either an original folio, or Vernor and Hood's reprint of 1807, since he
              transcribes the lines as there given, and so makes no mention of the half-line due to
              Pope. He likewise discards his emendation for &lsquo;discontented.&rsquo; Of
              the passage as a whole he says: &lsquo;&ldquo;Say't be so&rdquo; ought to
              be given to Sicinius; as for </p>
            <p>the metre, it might be safely left to the ear of any judicious reader. But there is a
              special reason for arranging the passage as it ought to stand: <hi rend="bq">
                  &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Men.</hi> Well and say that Marcius<lb/> Return me,
                as Cominius is return'd,<lb/> Unheard; what then?&mdash;but as<lb/> A

              </hi>
            </p>
            <p>The verse of six syllables [l. 51] may be thought by some to be purposely defective;
              but, in the first place, there is no pause in the sense after the word
              &ldquo;as,&rdquo; and pauses of this kind are generally catalectic, or ending
              in the middle of a foot; and, in the second place, the sense is as defective as the
              metre, for, as the words now stand, Menenius is made to suppose that Marcius may
              return him unheard, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> as a discontented friend&mdash;that
              is, without listening to him, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> without granting his request.

              Cominius the conditions on which alone he would condescend to treat with Rome, which
              seems to imply that he had first taken the opinion of the Volscians after Cominius had

              <hi rend="smallcap">Heath</hi> (p. 427): As specious as the emendation of Sir Thomas
              Hanmer appears [see <hi rend="italic">Text. Notes</hi>], it cannot possibly be right
              unless we suppose Coriolanus to have violated his oath out of regard for the old
              Menenius. For he himself afterwards (V, iii, 17-19) expressly tells us that he had
              yielded to new conditions. I conjecture the poet might possibly have written,
              &lsquo;Bound with an oath, <hi rend="italic">if you</hi> yield to <hi
                rend="italic">his</hi> conditions,&rsquo; that is, To remove the apprehension
              and terror the city might be under from his resentment he declared what he would not
              do, and bound himself to it by an oath if it accepted the conditions he had
                offered.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Capell</hi>: To make any sense at all of
              these lines [82-84] it was necessary to adopt the word &lsquo;<hi rend="italic"
                >from</hi>&rsquo; [in l. 83]; and that done, the hemistich became necessary
              likewise; but what to do with the lines that precede it the editor could not see at
              that time; all he then saw was an appearance of meaning that pleas'd him better than
              any change he had seen of them; but coming now to put thoughts upon paper, he
              perceiv'd they were wrong, and a little further reflection discover'd the true seat of
              this error, the hemistich guiding </p>
            <p>him to it. Other words besides &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">from</hi>&rsquo; have
              slip'd through the compositor's fingers, and we must read the lines thus,
              &lsquo;What he would do, &verbar; He sent in writing after me; what he would
              not, &verbar; <hi rend="italic">Except we</hi> yield to his conditions,
              &verbar; Bound with an oath. So that,&rsquo; &amp;c. Here were conditions
              offered and conditions refused; it is useless to guess at the first, 'tis sufficient
              that we suppose them humiliating enough; the latter, it is probable, were a cessation
              of arms in the country, and a removal of his siege from the town; for he does these
              things afterwards, and is made to break his &lsquo;oath&rsquo; by his

            <p>Here is, I think, a chasm. The speaker's purpose seems to be this: &lsquo;To

              place, means to <hi rend="italic">relax,</hi> and is used in the same sense in scene

            <p>What Cominius means to say is &lsquo;That Coriolanus sent in writing after him
              the conditions on which he would agree to make a peace, and bound himself by an oath
              not to depart from them. The additional negative which Hanmer and Warburton wish to
              introduce is not only unnecessary, but would destroy the sense; for the thing which
              Coriolanus had sworn <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to do was to <hi rend="italic">yield
                in his conditions.</hi>&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Henley</hi>: &lsquo;What

              maintain. If these conditions were admitted the oath, of course, being grounded on
              that proviso, must <hi rend="italic">yield to them</hi> and be cancelled. That this is

              commentators suspect some omission here, but it appears to us that they have mistaken

              especially &lsquo;bound with an oath.&rsquo; Coriolanus sends &lsquo;in
              writing&rsquo; both &lsquo;what he would do&rsquo; and &lsquo;what he
              would not&rsquo;; and in justification of the harshness of his demands he adds
              that he is &lsquo;bound with an oath to yield to his conditions,&rsquo; that
              is, to make his sole law the &lsquo;conditions&rsquo; in which he had become
              placed&mdash;his duty to the Volcians; to yield himself up entirely to the
              guidance of those &lsquo;conditions.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Collier</hi>: The meaning appears to be that Coriolanus bound himself by an oath
              that Rome should yield to his conditions. Various changes of the text have been
              proposed, but none seems absolutely necessary.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Verplanck</hi>: Coriolanus sends his ultimatum (to use the language of diplomacy) in
              writing, stating both what he would and what he would not consent to, and binding all
              with an oath that these are the conditions to which Rome must yield. This line [82] is
              elliptically expressed, but the sense is sufficiently explicit. But the editors have
              not been satisfied, and propose various emendations, of which &lsquo;to yield to
              no conditions&rsquo; is far the most probable.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Delius</hi>: It has been thought that there is here an omission of either a half or
              a whole line. Such an ellipsis and anacoluthon is, however, quite in Shakespeare's
              style. The sense is: He sent after me in writing what he would do, what he would not
              do (<hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> what he would grant to us and what not); he bound me
              with an oath to submit to his conditions. &lsquo;Bound,&rsquo; which the
              editors take for a participle, is rather of the same order as
              &lsquo;sent,&rsquo; and out of &lsquo;after me&rsquo; <hi
                rend="italic">me</hi> is to be supplied. We may construe this, without ellipsis: he
              sent in writing after me what he would do (and) what he would not; and bound me with
              an oath to yield to his conditions. Cominius is thus made ambassador to the

              which Coriolanus would not grant unless under certain conditions that he bound himself
              by oath to make them yield to. In the text the concise phraseology scarcely makes
              evident that there are two sets of articles, one drawn up by Coriolanus and sent in
              writing, the other submitted by the Romans to him, which he vows to grant only upon
              his own conditions; but that so it is clearly intended we think is shown by the
              account of the incident in Plutarch as well as by the expression &lsquo;it was a

              &lsquo;bound with an oath&rsquo; to be determined by those conditions. The
              meaning simply is that he wrote conditions, and swore to allow nothing but what was
              expressed therein. The phrase &lsquo;to his conditions&rsquo; has been
              suspected by the commentators, but no alteration is wanted. Shakespeare judiciously

              the most probable explanation is that something has been omitted (which is
              corroborated by the incomplete line &lsquo;So that all hope is vain&rsquo;),
              [due, however, to Johnson, not Shakespeare.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>],
              wherein the conditions of Coriolanus would be demonstrated as unacceptable. If all is,
              however, in proper order this line can only be well interpreted thus: that he was
              bound by an oath to submit to his conditions, that is, the conditions which he made in
              the name of the Volscians, to make them as his own, according as they were decided on

              this is very forced. Many emendations have been suggested, only showing that the text

              I can see no corruption, no obscurity in this line. Coriolanus specified in his
              written despatch what concessions he was willing to make, adding, as a proviso, that
              in everything else Cominius should bind himself by oath to submit to <hi rend="italic"
                >his</hi> (Coriolanus') conditions. In the last clause the subject is changed from
              Coriolanus to Cominius. The grammar may lack completeness, but it should be remembered
              that here we have a brief and hurried summary of a short and curt
              interview&mdash;a sort of running conversational comment; say there is a little
              looseness, there is no obscurity; the Romans who heard would not be slow to apprehend
              what was meant; their fears had already anticipated the sinister tidings. Brevity here
              is surely a merit.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Henry Irving Sh.</hi>): The desired meaning is that Coriolanus was bound by an oath
              to the Volscians to impose certain conditions, or to make the Romans yield to his
              conditions; but it must be confessed that the text does not say this. Or the meaning
              may be that the <hi rend="italic">message</hi> was affirmed by an oath, viz., that his
              conditions must be yielded to. Various punctuations have been proposed, and numerous
              emendations, none of them satisfactory. [Beeching, a few years later in the <hi
                rend="italic">Falcon Sh.,</hi> says: &lsquo;His declaration was confirmed with
              an oath to yield <hi rend="italic">only</hi> to his conditions, to retire from Rome
              only if his conditions were complied with.&rsquo; He compares for this V, iii,
              15-17, &lsquo;I have . . . once more offered The first conditions which they did
              refuse And cannot now accept.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              and explain: &lsquo;He sent me an offer of concessions, strictly limited, and
              dependent on an oath to observe the conditions laid down.&rsquo; Coriolanus has
              already begun to waver. He repeats to Menenius in V, ii, 91 the offer made to
                Cominius.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Cholmeley</hi>: The text is corrupt, but can
              be made tolerable by transposing the two parts of l. 81; &lsquo;his

              &lsquo;Bound with an oath,&rsquo; etc., give the cause of his behaviour; he
              had sworn not to discuss the situation.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Herford</hi>
                (<hi rend="italic">Eversley Sh.</hi>): The transaction is obscurely described.
              Apparently it is thus: Coriolanus indicates what he will concede, and binds himself by
              oath to concede nothing more.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Student's Sh.</hi>): The passage is undoubtedly corrupt. The
              difficulty is this: Two later passages (V, ii, 50-52; V, iii, 89-91) show that
              &lsquo;bound with an oath&rsquo; refers to Coriolanus and qualifies
              &lsquo;what he would not&rsquo; (do). Coriolanus would not do certain things
              (V, iii, 92, 93) because he had sworn not to. But &lsquo;to yield to his
              conditions&rsquo; ought to refer to the Romans; that is the natural
              interpretation, and it is substantiated by the parallel passage in Plutarch.
              Coriolanus told the Roman Ambassadors that &lsquo;they had no other means to end
              this war, if they did not grant these honest and just conditions of peace,&rsquo;
              which he had just laid before them. Through some omission in l. 82 the words in l. 81
              which refer to Coriolanus have got tacked on to the words which refer to the Romans.
              Johnson's is clearly the right method of interpretation; the assumption being that l.
              82 </p>
            <p>commenced with some such words as <hi rend="italic">Were utter shame.</hi> The
              simplest emendation is <hi rend="italic">hold</hi> for
              &lsquo;yield&rsquo;&mdash;Coriolanus had sworn to hold to, not to relax,
              the terms he had offered. But <hi rend="italic">hold</hi> could hardly be corrupted
              into &lsquo;yield&rsquo;; moreover, <hi rend="italic">yield</hi> occurs twice
              in North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> in a later paragraph referring to the same
              &lsquo;articles&rsquo; and &lsquo;<hi rend="italic"
              >conditions</hi>&rsquo; of peace. Of the passage as it stands the best paraphrase
              seems [to be that by Beeching in <hi rend="italic">Falcon Sh.</hi>]. But to speak of a
              man &lsquo;yielding&rsquo; to his own terms is obviously forced. It simplifies
              the text to substitute a comma for the semicolon after &lsquo;me&rsquo; in l.
              81.&mdash;Miss <hi rend="smallcap">C. Porter</hi> (<hi rend="italic">First Folio
                Sh.</hi>) does not refer to the interpretation by Delius, and thus evidently arrived
              at the same conclusion independently that if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> be understood
              before &lsquo;Bound&rsquo; and <hi rend="italic">me</hi> after
              &lsquo;Bound&rsquo; the sense is clear. Of Henley's paraphrase Miss Porter
              remarks: &lsquo;To prove that &ldquo;this is the proper sense of the
              passage&rdquo; Henley cites the words of Coriolanus to his mother lat&egrave;r
              as to &ldquo;the things he has forsworne to grant.&rdquo; But the text reads
              &ldquo;the thing,&rdquo; not &ldquo;the things,&rdquo; as Henley
              quotes it, nor does it there appear that the two things designated as by treaty
              forsworn are so exactly specified. He seems rather to be thinking of what he has
              forsworn to the Volscians, to show the Romans no favor. Nor does he speak to his
              mother of any formal treaty. Instead of binding himself with an oath to yield anything
              to the Romans, he has bound the Romans to yield him beforehand, as the very ground of
              any agreement, their acceptance of what he would not do, making what he would do
              entirely conditional. That is, he bases any concessions upon their sworn agreement to
              his conditions. He will not treat with them, will not agree under such or such
              conditions to lay down arms, until they have sworn beforehand to yield these
              preliminaries. <hi rend="italic">What he would not</hi> do, being <hi rend="italic"
                >Bound with</hi> or safeguarded by <hi rend="italic">an Oath</hi> from them <hi
                rend="italic">to yeeld to his conditions.</hi> This accords with what Plutarch
              states to be his answer to the ambassadors of Rome.&rsquo; [See <hi rend="italic"
                >Appendix</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Source of Plot, ad loc.</hi>] Later Plutarch shows
              again that these preliminary conditions were exactly the bone of contention, balking
              any treaty to follow, for &lsquo;another ambassade&rsquo; proposed
              &lsquo;the remove of the Volsces . . . that afterward they might with better
              leisure fall to such agreements together, as should be thought most meete and
              necessary . . . all the [Volsces] would reasonably aske should be graunted unto by the
              Romaines, who would willingly yield to reason, conditionally, that they did lay downe
              armes.&rsquo; This was precisely what Marcius would not do until they had bound
              themselves as already stipulated, delivering up the articles agreed upon which he had
              first delivered them. Or otherwise, that he would not assure their safe-conduct
              &lsquo;againe to his campe with such vaine and frivolous messages.&rsquo;
              These much disputed lines of Shakespeare's are obviously based on these
                facts.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Gordon</hi>: What he would not do he bound with
              an oath that we must yield to his conditions. Cominius had come as an ambassador from
              Rome to plead for terms. Coriolanus refused to treat with him. The conditions he
              offered (&lsquo;what he would do&rsquo;) were final; to discuss them was
              useless; they should be sent after in writing. Cominius's proposals (&lsquo;what
              he would not&rsquo;) he refused, and clinched his refusal with an oath that we
              must yield to his conditions. It was to be his conditions or nothing.&mdash; <hi
                rend="smallcap">Deighton</hi>: If genuine, this passage may mean he would send in

              with the Volscians. &lsquo;Bound&rsquo; seems to be an instance of the
              participle with the pronoun implied.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi> (<hi

            <p>probably intended, but its precise difficulties are insoluble because something
              appears to be lost, perhaps after &lsquo;conditions&rsquo; (as Johnson
              supposed) or perhaps after &lsquo;oath&rsquo; (as Malone), and also, possibly,
              after &lsquo;country,&rsquo; [l. 85]. The tinkering of the passage . . .
              serves no useful purpose, the only tolerable suggestion being Solly's, to alter the
              word &lsquo;yield&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">hold.</hi> With this change the
              passage affords a grudging sense as it stands: What he would do he sent in writing

              desire to avoid assumptions and alterations; but as we know Coriolanus was bound by an
              oath (V, iii, 91) it is as difficult to turn this phrase over to the Romans and their
              acceptance of the conditions as it is to deprive them of &lsquo;yield&rsquo;
              by substituting <hi rend="italic">hold</hi> as above.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap"

              Cominius, he might suppress what he was going to add through haste to try the success
              of a last expedient. It has been proposed to me to read &lsquo;Unless <hi

                his,</hi> abbreviated <hi rend="italic">in's,</hi> might have been easily mistaken

              amendment is wanting, the sense of the passage being complete without it. We say every

              of&mdash;My </p>
            <p>only hope is in you, or in him. The same mode of expression occurs in this sentence,
              and occasions the obscurity of it.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: That
              this passage has been considered as difficult surprises me. Many passages in these
              plays have been suspected to be corrupt merely because the language was peculiar to
              Shakespeare, or the phraseology of that age, and not of the present; and this is
              surely one of them. Had he written, his noble mother and his wife are our <hi
                rend="italic">only hope,</hi> his meaning could not have been doubted; and is not
              this precisely what Cominius says? So that we have now no other hope, nothing to rely
              upon <hi rend="italic">but</hi> his mother and his wife, who, as I am told, mean,
              &amp;c. &lsquo;Unless&rsquo; is here used for <hi rend="italic"

              [of &lsquo;unless&rsquo; used for <hi rend="italic">except</hi> as by Mason
              and Malone] to me is far from satisfactory, and I think it very probable that (as some
              one suggested to Steevens) our author wrote &lsquo;Unless <hi rend="italic"

              absurd. [The reading <hi rend="italic">in's</hi>] is so appropriate and so natural,

              passages &lsquo;unless&rsquo; should be parsed as a conjunction or should be
              held to partake rather of the nature of a preposition; but none can fail to be struck
              with the remarkableness of the coincidence that in all the passages the same particle
              is found without a finite verb actually following it. For my own part I hold that in
              the passage before us it is most certainly a conjunction, and that in all probability
              the verb that belongs to it, and that should be mentally supplied after it, is the
              verb that occurs in the <hi rend="italic">relative clause which
              follows</hi>&mdash;yes, the same verb, but not used in exactly the same sense;
              for, whereas in the relative clause &lsquo;solicit&rsquo; means &lsquo;to
              earnestly entreat,&rsquo; in the principal clause, where we say
              &lsquo;that&rsquo; is understood, it can only mean &lsquo;to prevail by
              entreaty,&rsquo; one verb (as is not uncommon) serving for two clauses, which in
              its strict acceptation suits only one of them. There is surely no maze here to hinder
              us from treading out the way readily. </p>

              mind his original nature, and therefore rightly takes on the form of eloquent prose.

              author's time for the total number of tickets in a <hi rend="italic">lottery,</hi>
              which took its name from thence. So in the <hi rend="italic">Continuation of Stowe's

              by the number of lots, there were then taken out and thrown away three score thousand
              blanks, without abating of any one prize.&rsquo; The lots were, of course, more
              numerous than the blanks. If &lsquo;lot&rsquo; signified <hi rend="italic"
                >prize,</hi> as Dr Johnson supposed, there being in every lottery many more blanks
              than prizes, Menenius must be supposed to say that the chance of his name having
              reached their ears was very small, which certainly is not his meaning.&mdash;<hi

              certainly is so; though our sagacious Hibernian [Malone] believes him mistaken.
              Menenius, he imagines, only means to say that it is more than an equal chance that his
              name had touch'd their ears, which is precisely the effect of Dr Johnson's
              explanation. . . . Menenius says it is <hi rend="italic">prizes</hi> to <hi

            <p>piece of waste paper, &amp;c. A lot is what one <hi rend="italic">gains</hi> in
              the lottery; and our learned editor, no doubt, if he got a blank would say he had <hi
                rend="italic">gain'd</hi> a loss. Neither Shakespeare, however, nor Menenius was an
                Irishman.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: &lsquo;Lots to

                rend="smallcap">W. A. Wright</hi>: This must, as Steevens says, be equivalent to the
              proverbial phrase in <hi rend="italic">Richard III.</hi> Menenius means that the
              chances are greatly in favour of his name having been mentioned, the comparison being
              not of the number, but of the relative value of the lots and blanks.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Case</hi>: Mr Craig explained, &lsquo;any odds, a thousand to
              one,&rsquo; but retained the reckoning by numbers, not values, as he added
              &lsquo;literally, lottery tickets which bring a prize to the drawer to those which
              bring no prize,&rsquo; and avoided the dilemma pointed out by Malone by stating,
              &lsquo;It is clear that in the lotteries of Shakespeare's day the lots [prizes]
              exceeded the blanks.&rsquo; But this deduction seems quite unwarranted. The <hi
                rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi> also explains &lsquo;lot&rsquo; as <hi
                rend="italic">prize,</hi> and &lsquo;It is lots to blanks&rsquo; as = It is
              a thousand to one; but in its first example the lots clearly include prizes and
              blanks, and in only one example is there really a distinction made between
              them.&mdash;[Ritson, in his malevolent zeal to show Malone at fault, has quite
              overshot the mark; Malone's quotation shows quite clearly that the words
              &lsquo;lot&rsquo; and <hi rend="italic">prize</hi> are not synonymous, and
              that herein Johnson is mistaken. As a further corroboration of the technical meaning
              of the word the following extract from the tract <hi rend="italic">The Great Frost of
                January, 1608</hi> may be quoted: &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Countryman:</hi> I
              remember that, as I take it, in the eleventh year of Queen Elizabeth, a lottery began
              here in London; in which, if my memory fail not, there were four hundred thousand lots
              to be drawn. <hi rend="italic">Citizen:</hi> You say right. So much still lies in my
              memory. <hi rend="italic">Countryman:</hi> Marry, that lottery was only for money, and
              every lot was ten shillings&rsquo; (ed. Arber, p. 94). Again, in the same a little
              farther on, the Citizen says: &lsquo;&mdash;to every prize there are put in
              forty blanks. . . . There are 7,600 prizes and 42,000 blanks&rsquo; (Ibid., p.
              95). This is in reference to a lottery which was held, among other shows and
              festivals, on the occasion of the Thames being frozen over in that year. There is,
              perhaps, here another slight hint of internal evidence that this play was written in
              either 1608 or 1609. The great popularity of this lottery would make the phrase used
              by Menenius readily understood by his auditors.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Warburton</hi>: Shakespeare's mighty talent in painting the
              manners is especially remarkable in this place. Menenius here and Polonius in <hi
                rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> have much of the same natural character. The difference is
              only accidental. The one was a senator in a free state, and the other a courtier and
              minister to a king; which two circumstances afforded matter for that inimitable
              ridicule thrown over the character of Polonius. For the rest, there is an equal
              complaisance for those they follow; the same disposition to be a <hi rend="italic"
                >creature,</hi> the same love of prate, the same affectation of wisdom, and
              forwardness to be in business. But we must never believe Shakespeare could make either
              of them say, &lsquo;I have verified my friends with all the size of
              verity&rsquo;; nay, what is more extraordinary, <hi rend="italic">verified them
                beyond verity.</hi> Without doubt he wrote, &lsquo;For I have ever <hi
                rend="italic">narrified</hi> my friends,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi>
              made their encomium. This too agrees with the foregoing metaphors of <hi rend="italic"
                >book, read,</hi> and constitutes a uniformity amongst them. From whence the <hi
                rend="italic">Oxford Editor</hi> [Hanmer] took occasion to read <hi rend="italic"
                >magnified,</hi> which makes the absurdity much worse than he found it; for to <hi
                rend="italic">magnify</hi> signifies to <hi rend="italic">exceed</hi> the truth; so
              that this critic makes him say he <hi rend="italic">magnified</hi> his friend <hi
                rend="italic">within</hi> the size of verity, that is, he exceeded truth even while
              he kept within it.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Johnson</hi>: If the commentator had
              given any example of the word <hi rend="italic">narrify</hi> the correction would have
              been not only received but applauded. Now, since the new word stands without
              authority, we must try what sense the old one will afford. To verify is to establish
              by testimony. One may say with propriety he brought false witnesses to <hi
                rend="italic">verify</hi> his title. Shakespeare considered the word with his usual
              laxity, as importing rather <hi rend="italic">testimony</hi> than <hi rend="italic"
                >truth,</hi> and only meant to say, I bore <hi rend="italic">witness</hi> to my
              friends with all the size that verity would suffer. I must remark that to <hi
                rend="italic">magnify</hi> signifies to <hi rend="italic">exalt</hi> or <hi
                rend="italic">enlarge,</hi> but not necessarily to enlarge beyond the
                truth.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Edwards</hi> (p. 98):
              &lsquo;Verified&rsquo; here is certainly wrong, as Mr Warburton in a long note
              has shown. To mend it he gives us a word which, if it is not his own, I doubt he can
              find no better authority for than the Dictionary of N. Bailey, Philolog., who has
              taken care to preserve all the cant words he could pick up. However, he gives the
              honor of it to Shakespeare, and says, &lsquo;without doubt he wrote &ldquo;I
              have ever <hi rend="italic">narrified</hi> my friends,&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">i.
                e.,</hi> made their encomium.&rsquo; I suppose Menenius read his encomiums out
              of a book, or at least learned them there, and then <hi rend="italic">narrified</hi>
              by rote. But though Mr Warburton makes no doubt of Shakespeare's writing <hi
                rend="italic">narrified,</hi> I must own I do; and if it were lawful for one, who is
              not a critic by profession, to make a conjecture after him, which yet I would not
              venture to thrust into the text without authority, I should imagine that possibly
              Shakespeare might have written, &lsquo;I have ever <hi rend="italic"
              >varnished</hi> my friends . . . with all the size that verity Would without lapsing
              suffer.&rsquo; That is, I have laid on as much praise as would stick. It is an
              allusion either to painting or white-washing; and the word <hi rend="italic"
              >varnish</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">vernish,</hi> as it is sometimes spelt) agrees
              with the following metaphor of <hi rend="italic">size,</hi> at least as well as <hi
                rend="italic">narrify</hi> does with <hi rend="italic">book</hi> before. The only
              misfortune is that the uniformity is </p>
            <p>broken; but that is of the less consequence, because otherwise it would be knocked to
              pieces by the &lsquo;bowls&rsquo; which come in the very next line. Whether
              this be right or no, I doubt <hi rend="italic">narrifying</hi> with <hi rend="italic"
                >size</hi> will pass on nobody but a professed critic.&mdash; <hi
                rend="smallcap">Heath</hi> (p. 428): If I had not learned from the <hi rend="italic"
                >Canons of Criticism</hi> that the word <hi rend="italic">narrified</hi> is to be
              found in Bailey's Dictionary I should scarce have believed it authorized by any one
              writer in the English language. If it be not a cant word, as most probably it is, it
              conveys so ridiculous an idea that it can find no place in any other than burlesque
              writing. But <hi rend="italic">varnishing</hi> with <hi rend="italic">size</hi> [as
              Edwards suggests], and with all the size that verity would suffer, seems little less
              exceptionable than <hi rend="italic">narrifying.</hi> I think Sir Thomas Hanmer's
              correction, <hi rend="italic">magnified,</hi> bids fair for being the true reading.
              The word <hi rend="italic">verity</hi> at the end of the next line might strike the
              eye of the transcriber or printer, and hang upon his imagination sufficiently to
              occasion the blunder. But Mr Warburton objects, that &lsquo;to <hi rend="italic"
                >magnify</hi> signifies to exceed the truth&rsquo;; and so makes an impotent
              effort to pass this expression on the reader for a bull. His very prayers might have
              taught him better. To <hi rend="italic">magnify</hi> signifies to extol the greatness
              of anything in some respect or other, whether the praise exceed the truth, or keep
              within the strict bounds of it. The word <hi rend="italic">size</hi> doth not here
              signify the composition otherwise called paste, as the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                >Canons of Criticism</hi> seems to misapprehend it, but dimension. [Heath, by thus
              treating with mock seriousness the <hi rend="italic">jeu d'esprit</hi> of Edwards in
              regard to &lsquo;varnish,&rsquo; &lsquo;size,&rsquo; and
              &lsquo;white-wash,&rsquo; places Warburton's emendation in the same ridiculous
              class. &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
              >Capell</hi> (vol. I, pt i, p. 99): This unlucky
              word&mdash;&lsquo;verified&rsquo;&mdash;has been tumbled and tossed
              about strangely and has chang'd its quarters for <hi rend="italic">narrify'd,
                magnify'd, varnish'd,</hi> &amp;c.; but, after all its peregrinations, here it
              is again, and here it should be. For, in the name of goodness, where is the
              impropriety of saying, When I have undertaken to give my friend <hi rend="italic">his
                due</hi> praise, I have sometimes given him <hi rend="italic">more than his
              due?</hi> Yet this is the amount of what is said by Menenius, but he says it in his
              manner. &lsquo;Size&rsquo; is proportion, dimension.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Steevens</hi>: Dr Johnson's explanation of the old word <hi
                rend="italic">verify</hi> renders all change unnecessary. To <hi rend="italic"
                >verify</hi> may, however, signify to <hi rend="italic">display.</hi> Thus in an
              ancient metrical pedigree in the possession of the late Duchess of Northumberland, and
              quoted by Dr Percy in <hi rend="italic">The Reliques of Ancient English Poetry,</hi>
              vol. i, p. 279, 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> edit., &lsquo;In hys scheld did schyne a
              mone veryfying her light.&rsquo; [The <hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi> does not
              include <hi rend="italic">to display</hi> under the various senses in which
              &lsquo;verify&rsquo; is used. In the line quoted by Steevens the word may,
              perhaps, be interpreted as therein given under 2. d., &lsquo;To demonstrate or
              prove (oneself) to be of a certain character,&rsquo; with this example,
              &lsquo;Fortune . . . Turned her selfe, as shee away would flie, . . . As what she
              was, her selfe to verifie.&rsquo; 1596. Drayton: <hi rend="italic">Leg., Dk.
                Normandie,</hi> cxxxiv. Under 1. c. &lsquo;To support or back up by
              testimony,&rsquo; the present line is quoted as the only example.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Malone</hi>: The meaning (to
              give a somewhat more expanded comment) is: &lsquo;I have ever spoken the truth of
              my friends, and in speaking of them have gone as far as I could go consistently with
              truth. I have not only told the truth, but the whole truth, and with the most
              favourable colouring that I could give to their actions without transgressing the
              bounds of truth.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> regards as
              indisputable the reading of his MS. Corrector, <hi rend="italic">magnified,</hi> but
              fails to call attention to the fact that this is the reading of Hanmer's
                text.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Singer</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sh.
              Vindicated,</hi> p. 225) is equally at fault in commenting upon this reading, and says
              in conclusion: &lsquo;If any change is necessary, which seems doubtful, <hi
                rend="italic">notified</hi> could hardly be distinguished, when written </p>
            <p>or printed as of old, from <hi rend="italic">uerified. Magnified</hi> has little
              similarity with it.&rsquo;&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Dyce</hi> (ed. i.): Here
              &lsquo;verified&rsquo; is a most suspicious reading, and perhaps crept into
              the text in consequence of the transcriber's or compositor's eye having rested on the
              word &lsquo;verity&rsquo; in the next line.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Staunton</hi>: Perhaps the true word is <hi rend="italic">rarefied,</hi> that is,
                <hi rend="italic">stretched out.</hi> See <hi rend="italic">Love's Labour's,</hi>
              IV, ii, 125, where, for &lsquo;Here are numbers ratified&rsquo; we should also
              probably read <hi rend="italic">rarefied.</hi> [Had Staunton no judicious friend who
              should have pointed out to him the somewhat ludicrous idea of Menenius making a boast
              of his constant occupation of <hi rend="italic">stretching out</hi> his friends? The
              only possible meaning of <hi rend="italic">rarify</hi> is to make rare or less dense.
              As to the word &lsquo;ratify&rsquo; in <hi rend="italic">Love's Labour's,</hi>
              Staunton is the sole editor or commentator who has suspected its
                validity.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">R.
                G. White</hi>: The senseless reading of the folio seems to be the result either of
              looking to &lsquo;verity&rsquo; at the end of the next line to assist in
              deciphering obscure manuscript, or of an anticipative remembrance of that word by a
              compositor who undertook to set the whole clause from a single reading.
              &lsquo;Amplified&rsquo; in the previous clause, and &lsquo;all the
              size&rsquo; in this, seems to me to fully justify the change of
              &lsquo;verified&rsquo; to <hi rend="italic">magnified</hi> which was made in
              Hanmer's edition and in Collier's folio.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Leo</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>): This seems almost to be nonsense. What I propose is
              not much better than <hi rend="italic">magnified,</hi> except that the expression is
              somewhat more distinct, and the word contains one letter more, corresponding with the
              letters in &lsquo;verified&rsquo;; I propose to read <hi rend="italic"
                >glorified.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Hudson</hi> (ed. i.): Some corruption
              of the text has long been suspected, and various changes proposed, but none so good as
                <hi rend="italic">magnified,</hi> which falls in perfectly with the meaning and
              position of <hi rend="italic">amplified</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                >size.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Keightley</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                >Expositor,</hi> p. 373): As &lsquo;verified&rsquo; would seem to have been
              suggested by the following &lsquo;verity,&rsquo; we might read, with Hanmer,
                <hi rend="italic">magnified,</hi> or perhaps repeat &lsquo;amplified.&rsquo;
              [See <hi rend="italic">Text. Notes.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Whitelaw</hi>:
              That is, I have always told the truth about my friends' good acts&mdash;always the
              whole truth&mdash;sometimes perhaps a little more than the truth. [This, it will
              be noticed, is little more than an abstract of Malone's interpretation, and to this
              Schmidt takes exception, saying that here &lsquo;verify&rsquo; means rather,
              &lsquo;I have always maintained the credit of my friends,&rsquo; which is the
              meaning he also attaches to this word in his <hi rend="italic"
                >Lexicon.</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >W. A. Wright</hi>: [Johnson's, Malone's, and Schmidt's] are all forced explanations
              of a word which is most likely corrupt, and they none of them fit in with
              &lsquo;size&rsquo; in the next line. Perhaps &lsquo;amplified&rsquo;
              might be repeated from the preceding line.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">E. K.
                Chambers</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Warwick Sh.</hi>): That is, spoken up for, borne
              witness to. Numerous emendations have been suggested. Most of these assume that a word
              implying exaggeration is wanted, but that does not come until ll. 23-26.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Henry Irving Sh.</hi>): Can this be
              a coinage of Menenius like &lsquo;<hi rend="italic"
              >conspectuities,</hi>&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">fidius'd,</hi> as if it were <hi
                rend="italic">very-fy</hi> in the sense of magnify, with a play on
              &lsquo;verity&rsquo; below? This clearly is the meaning intended. [Beeching
              did not repeat this in his <hi rend="italic">Falcon Ed.</hi> a year later, but
              accepted Johnson's explanation of this phrase. &mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Ed.</hi>]&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Verity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Student's
                Sh.</hi>): The <hi rend="italic">Century Dictionary</hi> gives as one of the
              significations of &lsquo;verify,&rsquo; &lsquo;to second or strengthen by
              aid; to back; to support the credit of,&rsquo; being an extension of the common
              meaning &lsquo;to confirm the truthfulness or authenticity of.&rsquo; Compare
                <hi rend="italic">King John,</hi> II, i, 277, &lsquo;To verify their title with
              their lives,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> to confirm, support. In speaking
              of his friends Menenius has always backed them up to the very limits of veracity. The
              word cannot, I think, be taken exactly in the sense &lsquo;been true, loyal
              to,&rsquo; though some so interpret it.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap"
              >Perring</hi> (p. 314): The occurrence of &lsquo;verity&rsquo; in the
              succeeding line seems to me </p>
            <p>to indicate that &lsquo;verify&rsquo; was the verb used. From the same
              circumstance others may draw an inference the very reverse. But this I would say, we
              must not expect, as a matter of course, to find in Shakespeare duplicates of what I
              may call Shakespearian curiosities. Many of his strange and strangely used words occur
              but once, proving how careful he was not to adulterate with too liberal an admixture
              of alloy the pure gold of the English tongue.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Case</hi>
                (<hi rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>): Different meanings have been extracted out of
              &lsquo;verified,&rsquo; but Johnson has probably given as good an unforced
              sense as can be obtained. . . . Possibly Shakespeare in this line thinks of
              Coriolanus's fame as it exists outside the record which men have read in
              &lsquo;the book&rsquo; Menenius, and of Menenius as authenticating that fame
              by his testimony. Mr Craig was very doubtful of the word, and seems at one time to
              have thought of substituting <hi rend="italic">amplified</hi> in the
                text.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Tucker Brooke</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Yale
              Sh.</hi>): The Folio reading gives a reasonable sense, I have shown my friends to be

                >pasmer</hi> or <hi rend="italic">p&acirc;mer.</hi> I have frequently used the
              liberty to give sense to an unmeaning passage by the introduction of a French word of
              the same sound, which I suppose to be of Shakespeare's own coining. And I am certainly
              justified in so doing by the great number of such sort of words to be found in the
              common text.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Johnson</hi>: It is not denied that many
              French words were mingled in the time of Elizabeth with our language, which have since
              been ejected, and that many which are known then to have been in use may be properly
              recalled when they will help the sense. But when a word is to be admitted, the first
              question should be, by whom was it ever received? in what book can it be shewn? If it
              cannot be proved to have been in use, the reasons which can justify its reception must
              be stronger than any critic will have to bring.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              nothing will satisfy him but </p>
            <p>making them swoon that he may have an opportunity of bringing in a French
                word.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Heath</hi> (p. 429): The author of the <hi
                rend="italic">Canons of Criticism</hi> hath very justly exposed Mr Warburton's most
              ridiculous emendation, . . . though the word [<hi rend="italic">pasms</hi> or <hi
                rend="italic">p&acirc;mes</hi>] as a noun is as unknown to the French as it is
              to the English language, and probably to every language that is human. I do indeed
              admit that &lsquo;a great number of French words are incorporated in our language,
              and used by Shakespeare in common with other writers&rsquo;; but that there are a
              great number of such words to be met with in his writings which are of his own
              coining, and peculiar to himself, is a circumstance which, I must confess, hath
              escaped my observation. But granting the fact to be true; is that a sufficient
              justification for over-loading him with such words by wholesale for mere fanciful
              conjecture only, in defiance of the authority of all his editions, and that too when
              their text expresses his meaning in English full as well, and frequently much better,
              and with more force and elegance? To detect the weakness and insufficiency of Mr
              Warburton's defence we need but apply the reasoning on which it is founded to a
              similar instance. Whoever hath but dipped into Shakespeare must have observed a
              certain obscurity, which may be considered as one of the characteristic peculiarities
              of his style, arising in great measure from the grandeur, the strength, and the
              exactness of his conceptions, which he could not equal by the force of his expression,
              though his powers even of this kind were never excelled by any other writer. It is the
              business of a critic to illustrate these obscurities, but he would be justly laughed
              at and exploded if he should set about multiplying their number under the pretext that
              he was strictly adhering to Shakespeare's manner.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"

              perhaps the finest scene in the play. It is also one of the most important. Two mighty
              kindred spirits clash together, and in the clash Coriolanus' second failure is
              determined. The powerful individuality of Volumnia, kept in the background hitherto
              and only suggested, now dominates the action, and, by contact with her, Coriolanus too
              rises to a pitch of higher dignity than he has yet reached.&mdash;<hi
                rend="smallcap">Stopford Brooke</hi> (p. 241): We find Coriolanus worshipped as a
              leader, not as a man, by the Volscian soldiery; apparently on the peak of fortune. But
              he is really more lost, more alone than ever. No one loves him. He can have no
              communion with his comrades. It is almost pitiable to hear his appeals to Aufidius,
              who hates him, to tell him what to do. Then, in his solitude, his affections, the best
              part of him, which his pride had smothered, awake again. Though he repulses Menenius,
              who comes to implore grace for Rome, we feel that he loves him. He longs to see his
              mother, his wife, and son, but his position is such that he dare not satisfy his
              longing. It is a piteous case, for if we add to his vast loneliness this intense and
              silent emotion of natural affection, whose indulgence is forbidden, he becomes (as
              Shakespeare's sympathy with sorrow meant him to become) an object of noble pity to the
              audience&mdash;and, perhaps, to the gods. </p>

            <p>explanation is offered in the play of how the ladies were more successful than
              Menenius in passing the outposts. It is doubtless to be found in these words of
              Plutarch: &lsquo;They went in troupe together unto the Volsces camp, whom, when
              they saw, they of themselves did both pity and reverence her, <hi rend="italic">and
                there was not a man among them that once durst say a word unto her.</hi>&rsquo;
              But in Plutarch Coriolanus receives every one who comes from Rome. </p>
            <p>28. <hi rend="bold">But out affection,</hi> etc.] <hi rend="smallcap">A. C.
              Bradley</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> p. 13): To me this scene is one in
              which the tragic feelings of fear and pity have little place. Such anxiety as I feel
              is not for the fate of the hero or of any one else; it is, to use religious language,
              for the safety of his soul. And when he yields, though I know, as he divines, that his
              life is lost, the emotion I feel is not pity; he is above pity and above life. And the
              anxiety itself is but slight; it bears no resemblance to the hopes and fears that
              agitate us as we approach the end in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> or <hi
                rend="italic">King Lear.</hi> The whole scene affects me, to exaggerate a little,
              more as a majestic picture of stationary figures than as the fateful climax of an
              action speeding to its close. And the structure of the drama seems to confirm this
              view. Almost throughout the first three acts&mdash;that is, up to the
              banishment&mdash;we have incessant motion, excited and resounding speech, a
              violent oscillation of fortunes. But after this the dramatic tension is suddenly
              relaxed, and though it increases again, it is never allowed to approach its previous
              height. If Shakespeare had wished to do so in this scene he had only to make us wait
              in dread of some interposition from Aufidius, at which the hero's passion might have
              burst into a fury fatal even to the influence of Volumnia. But our minds are crossed
              by no shadow of such dread. From the moment when he catches sight of the advancing
              figures, and the voice of nature&mdash;what he himself calls &lsquo;great
              nature&rsquo;&mdash;begins to speak in his heart long before it speaks aloud
              to his ear, we know the end. And all this is in harmony with that characteristic of
              the drama which we noticed at first&mdash;we feel but faintly, if at all, the
              presence of any mysterious or fateful agency. We are witnessing only the conquest of
              passion by simple human feelings, and <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is as much a
              drama of reconciliation as a tragedy. That is no defect in it, but it is a reason why
              it cannot leave the same impression as the supreme tragedies, and should be judged by
              its own standard. </p>

              <hi rend="smallcap">Stopford Brooke</hi> (p. 242): This is Coriolanus at his best,
              thrilled by those natural affections which last longest, and which in their natural
              working are the best medicine for the selfish heart. Coriolanus fights against them;
              his promise to Aufidius, his vow of revenge beat back his yielding and forgiveness.
              But when his mother finally turns from mere arguing the question to her ancient way
              with him, and claims his reverence for his motherhood; and then, when he is still
              silent, breaks into scorn of him, and bids him, repudiating him, seek his family among
              the Volscians&mdash;why then Coriolanus can bear no more. His lonely pride is
              shattered by the dominance of what is tender, good, and natural in him. For the first
              time in his life he is truly unselfish. He gives up his most passionate
              desire&mdash;revenge. He puts away pride and anger, the tyrannic qualities of his
              nature; and he does this knowing, at least suspecting, that this means his
              death&mdash;and it does mean it. The man is redeemed. The repentence is not too
              late for honour, not too late for moral greatness; for thus conquered, he is at last
              great, having won by renouncing all that he once thought were the sources of his fame,
              immortal fame. But he is not freed from the results of his long wrong-doing.
              Repentence is too late to save his life, and that he knows he is doomed makes his act
              the nobler. Thus Shakespeare veils the perishing man with tenderness, pity, and
              admiration. We forgive what we hated in him in the past. His wife and mother, knowing
              he is lost, yet went home with peace in their heart, and Rome remembered only his fame
              as a warrior. Over his dead body the patricians and the tribunes came to respect each
              other more. The dead Coriolanus was greater than the living. </p>

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">Theobald</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sh. Restored,</hi> p. 181): I
              dare say an old corruption has possess'd this passage for two reasons. In the first
              place, whoever consults this speech will find that he is talking to his wife, and not
              praying to the Gods at all. <hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> if he were employ'd in
              his devotions, no apology would be wanting for leaving his mother unsaluted. The
              Poet's intention was certainly this: Coriolanus, having been lavish in his
              tendernesses and Raptures to his wife, bethinks himself on the sudden, that his
              fondness to her had made him guilty of ill manners in the neglect of his mother.
              Restore, as it certainly ought to be, &lsquo;You Gods! <hi rend="smallcap">I
              prate</hi>, And the most noble mother of the world Leave
              unsaluted.&rsquo;&mdash; Mr <hi rend="smallcap">Dennis</hi> (than whom, in my
              opinion, no man in England better understands Shakespeare) in his alteration of this
              play [<hi rend="italic">The Invader of His Country</hi>], whether he made the same
              correction I now do, certainly understood the passage exactly with me. An undeniable
              proof of this is an appeal to the change in expression which he has put upon it:
              &lsquo;But Oh! ye Gods, while fondly thus I <hi rend="italic">talk,</hi> see, the
              most noble mother of the world Stands unsaluted.&rsquo; I question not, but his
              reason for varying the expression was because <hi rend="italic">prate</hi> is a term
              ill-sounding in itself, and mean in its acceptation. Our language was not so refin'd,
              tho' more masculine, in Shakespeare's days; and therefore (notwithstanding the
              cacophony) when he is most serious he frequently makes use of the word. In this very
              play we again meet with it, &lsquo;yet here he lets me prate Like one i' th'
              stocks,&rsquo; [l. 170 below. </p>
            <p>Theobald gvies five other passages wherein the words <hi rend="italic">prate</hi> and
                <hi rend="italic">prattling</hi> occur; but the word <hi rend="italic">prate</hi> is
              used more often than that by Shakespeare. Bartlett gives fifteen examples. This play
              alone furnishes three others besides that quoted by Theobald. See I, i, 45; III, iii,
              106; and IV, v, 47. For <hi rend="italic">prattling</hi> see II, i, 221. This note,
              omitting all reference to Dennis, Theobald adopted in his own edition. The <hi
                rend="italic">Text. Notes</hi> show with what unanimity it has been
                accepted.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]&mdash;Miss <hi rend="smallcap"
                >C. Porter</hi> (<hi rend="italic">First Folio Sh.</hi>): Shakespeare changes the
              order of his salutations from that given by Plutarch and makes him show his love for
              his wife first and irresistibly; but he causes him to make amends for this by excusing
              himself for keeping his mother unsaluted while thus he prays Virgilia to forgive him,
              begs her not to urge him to forgive the Romans, and then, pleading for a kiss, prays
              the goddess of marriage to bear witness to its purity. All this justifies the word
              &lsquo;pray&rsquo; in the text, which Pope has changed to <hi rend="italic"
                >prate.</hi> Surely Coriolanus does not call this true emotion
              &lsquo;prating.&rsquo; Although he must be meant to ask pardon of his mother
              for leaving her unsaluted during all this, he cannot be meant to excuse himself by a
              word uncomplimentary to his wife. Shakespeare has very delicately done the right
              thing, and the fact of his altering Plutarch shows it to be peculiarly his touch. Pope
              has spoiled it. [I know not why Miss Porter assigns this reading to Pope. The
              Cambridge <hi rend="italic">Text. Notes</hi> plainly show by the parenthesis
              containing Theobald's name, following the reading of Pope's ed. ii, that <hi

              Volumnia's acceptance of this now would be marked by more than a reassertion of the

              confute a remark made by Pope in his Preface: &lsquo;The speeches copied from
              Plutarch in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> may be as well made an instance of the
              learning of Shakespeare as those copied from Cicero, in <hi rend="italic"
              >Catiline,</hi> of Ben Jonson's.&rsquo; Farmer's intent is to demonstrate that
              Shakespeare's knowledge was gained solely by the translation and not by recourse to
              the original. Pope has, however, not made any such claim; he clearly says, preceding
              the above-quoted sentence, &lsquo;There is certainly a vast difference between <hi
                rend="italic">Learning</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Languages.</hi> How far he was
              ignorant of the latter I cannot determine; but 'tis plain he had much reading at

              knowledge, whether he has it from one language or from another.&rsquo; Farmer, in
              thus quoting but the concluding part of Pope's remark, gives to the reader a quite
              erroneous impression of Pope's contention. He certainly did not mean that these
              parallel passages proved that Shakespeare read them in the original Greek. The passage

              <hi rend="smallcap">Snider</hi> (ii, 238): Here we have the strongest and most
              terrific image of filial violation. Strange to say, the wife, Virgilia, now utters the
              same sentiment; her mild nature has been absorbed in the colossal will of the mother.
              That is, his family, in all its relations, will be swept away in the destruction of
              the State. The only exception is his boy, another genuine Coriolanus, who will not
              submit to be trampled upon by an enemy. Still her appeals are not answered; she begins
              to despair of success. Then with lofty contempt she turns away, disowning her
              motherhood: &lsquo;This fellow had a Volscian </p>
            <p>to his mother.&rsquo; And all his other domestic relations are denied to him.
              This is too much for Coriolanus. His strongest tie he can allow to be severed; he
              might even contemplate his mother dead; still he would be her son. But
              disowned&mdash; denied to be her offspring&mdash;that cuts deeper than her
              death. He yields, Rome is saved, but he declares to his mother he will probably have
              to die for his act. To which declaration she gives no answer; country is, with her,
              above son; its salvation being accomplished, she and the rest of her relatives return

              customarily either ignores Capell or adopts his metrical changes without
              acknowledgment. To this Boswell, the editor of the Variorum of 1821, rejoins that this

              88): There is but one boy in all Shakespeare who even appears to promise some genuine
              variation from the perverse type [of precocious pertness as exhibited in Mamillius and
              young Macduff]. Young Coriolanus in the line and a half allotted to him, &lsquo;A
              shall not tread on me, I'll run away till I'm bigger, but then I'll fight,&rsquo;
              utters the solitary truly boy-like sentiment in the whole of Shakespeare's plays.
              Alas! like Marcellus, he is but shown and then withdrawn; he is only once put in
              person before us, and he seems to be an allegorical shadow of his father rather than
              an independent living being. We pass over here the boy in <hi rend="italic">Henry
              V.</hi> and the fool in <hi rend="italic">King Lear,</hi> both of whom, though
              seemingly very young, are beyond the age of childhood. Even in them, however, there

              reflection. [Compare III, iii, 113-124, where Coriolanus voices in rhymed couplets his
              determination to submit to what he considers degradation in soliciting the votes of
              the people. Possibly the rhyme is there also meant to indicate a softening or

              in 1765, the year of Johnson's publication. Neither Johnson nor Capell record this
              reading as original; a point whereon Capell is most meticulous. In my copy of the

              much-admired scene the ordinarily expressed praises, but for all that extol it highly,
              since it does not in any way tend towards a soft and gentle quietude, which here would
              be quite out of place. As soon as this mother, by her own person, has shown to him his
              mother Rome, and he feels himself vanquished, what words has our poet given him? Is
              the bow of peace again set forth in the heavens? and dare the hero recognise himself
              as the saviour of his country? Nay! his dreadful mistake is but brought more clearly
              to him, he feels it, and would willingly retract it and make good, but complete
              atonement is impossible, since a revolt from one's country is not to be expiated by
              such easy means, and he is henceforth for all time at variance with his native land

              tragic power of this scene lies in this, that Coriolanus, with the consciousness that
              this victory of filial duty will bear for him deadly fruit, yet bows before the might
              of filial duty. Therein is its wizardry, its most hidden skill revealed. The actor has
              here the task of presenting to us the hero overwhelmed by the power of filial love and

              </lemma>
              <hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 621): This collapse of Coriolanus' purpose
              means nothing more than the victory of his strongest impulse. There is no
              acknowledgment of offence, there is no renovation of character, there is not even
              submission to the highest force within his experience. Our admiration of his surrender
              is not unmixed. It is a moving spectacle to see a man, despite all the solicitations
              of wrath and revenge, of interest and fear, obedient to what is, on the whole, so
              salutary an influence as domestic affection. But loyalty to this will not of itself
              avail to safeguard anyone from criminal entanglements, or to equip him for beneficial
              public action, or to change the current of his life. It may mean the triumph of a
              natural tendency that happens to be good over other natural tendencies that happen to
              be bad, but it does not mean acceptance of duty as duty, or anxiety to satisfy the
              claims that different duties impose. Hence Coriolanus, to the very end, leaves
              unredeemed his inherited obligations to Rome, while he leaves unfulfilled his
              voluntary pledges to his allies. Even in Plutarch's narrative Shakespeare's insight is
              not required to detect this underlying thought, but in the <hi rend="italic"
                >Comparison,</hi> which there is proof that Shakespeare had studied, it is set forth
              so clearly that he who runs may read. That Shakespeare, with his patriotism and
              equity, perceived the double flaw in Coriolanus' act of grace can hardly be doubted.
              He was the last man to put the household above the national gods, or to glorify breach
              of contract if only it were sanctioned by domestic tenderness. In point of fact, he
              does not acquit his hero on either count. </p>

              Johnson's explanation of the phrase &lsquo;former fortune&rsquo; has been
              adopted by most modern editors. To the parallel passage from <hi rend="italic">Ant.

              besides the present shows, I think, that it was one that commended itself to

              drinking is not Roman, yet, on the other hand, it is characteristically English, and,
              therefore, Shakespeare has here assuredly written &lsquo;drink,&rsquo; just as

              calm and disengaged enough to make so gallant a compliment to the ladies. Let us

              and her confed'rate arms,&rsquo; and from that a little before, &lsquo;Let the
              Volscians Plough Rome, and harrow Italy,&rsquo; that the poet's head was running
              on the later grandeur of Rome, when, as at this time, her dominion extended only a few
              miles round the city.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Johnson</hi>: The speech suits
              Aufidius justly enough if it had been written for him; but it may, without
              impropriety, be </p>

              their leave of him, and invite them into his tent; which he would enter with very good
              grace if his speech were to end as they make it. And as for giving that part to
              Aufidius, the absurdity of such a step is, indeed, very strong; for he certainly has
              his engagements, and is not &lsquo;calm within&rsquo;; or, if he were, there
              is no part of his character that gives a handle to suspect him of gallantry, and to

              times a too sharp change&mdash;one, so to speak, affected on the
              stage&mdash;in the sentiments of his characters. Aufidius, for example, passes too
              quickly from hatred to sorrow when he sees Coriolanus fall, and in <hi rend="italic"
                >Richard III.</hi> Anne accepts with too great ease the ring of the man on whom she
              has just spit in contempt; while Elizabeth is too quick in giving her daughter to the
              man who has massacred her sons. This is certainly turning the corner too sharply, and
              there is a want of truth in it. I think that something of the same kind may be said of
              Shakespeare's style. The language which he puts into the mouths of his characters is
              not always appropriate&mdash;is sometimes far from being appropriate&mdash;to
              the circumstances, even to the characters themselves. The poet delights too much in
              the expression for itself and its own sake. He dwells on it, he lingers over it, he
              plays with equivalents and synonyms. Menenius thus complains of the change which has
              occurred in Coriolanus, [ll. </p>
            <p>17-24 here quoted]. I take this quotation at random to exemplify what I mean. This
              poet's form sometimes overruns in this fashion; the expression is redundant and out of

              about Coriolanus he is merciful. &lsquo;You report&rsquo; is, I think, here

              the attribute of mercy wanting in them and existing in the man. Was not the mockery of
              religion partly the purpose of this play, its judgments and punishments, and its want
              of pity and benevolence? Pardon to the Romans is granted by the man, but none is
              provided for Coriolanus, who falls a sacrifice to his forgiveness of injuries, the
              triumph of love over hate.&rsquo; In the foregoing pages I have purposely omitted
              many of Birch's comments on passages in this play, which, as they bear witness to

              &lsquo;Dost thou think that <hi rend="italic">I'</hi>ll grace thee with that
              robbery, thy name of Coriolanus stolen in Corioli?&rsquo; If the emphasis be
              thrown on &lsquo;<hi rend="italic">I,</hi>&rsquo; we think the author's
              intention in the sentence will be clear. The points in the scene which make us believe
              that Shakespeare intended it to be laid in Antium are these: In the first place Antium
              was the <hi rend="italic">capital</hi> of the Volscian territory, Corioli only one of
              the towns on its borders; therefore it was likely that the capital was the place to
              which Coriolanus and Aufidius would return to render an account of their expedition to
              Rome; and, accordingly, the latter begins by sending to &lsquo;tell the lords of
              the city,&rsquo; &amp;c. When they enter they bid him &lsquo;welcome <hi
                rend="italic">home</hi>&rsquo;<hi rend="italic">;</hi> and we know that
              Aufidius' residence was at Antium. The First Conspirator says, &lsquo;<hi
                rend="italic">Your native town</hi> you enter'd like a post, and had no welcome <hi
                rend="italic">home.</hi>&rsquo; Coriolanus tells the lords of the city,
              &lsquo;We have made peace, with no less honour to the <hi rend="italic"
              >Antiates</hi> than shame to the Romans&rsquo;; and these very lords of the city
              are also here styled &lsquo;heads of the state,&rsquo; which shows that they
              were chief rulers, rulers of the Volsces generally, and not merely city authorities
              belonging to any one of the Volscian towns. Finally&mdash;and which we think
              conclusive, because North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> was evidently the
              authority that Shakespeare followed throughout most closely&mdash;Plutarch
              distinctly states that Marcius and Aufidius returned to <hi rend="smallcap"
              >Antium</hi> when they came back from Rome.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Herwegh</hi>
              (ap. <hi rend="smallcap">Ulrici</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Coriolan.</hi>) brings forward
              substantially the same reasons for accepting Antium as the locale of this scene, but
              says, &lsquo;At the same time we do not wish to lay any special stress on the
              remark of the Conspirator to Aufidius in regard to his entrance into his native town,
              since possibly may be urged against this the remark of Volumnia, &ldquo;His wife
              is in Corioli.&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Rolfe</hi>: We
              should infer from l. 138 that this scene is not in Corioli. Surely Coriolanus would
              not have said this, but rather &lsquo;in this city here,&rsquo; or to that
              effect; but we believe that none of the commentators have referred to this as a reason
              for not following Singer in placing this scene in Corioli. According to Plutarch
              Antium should be the place.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Beeching</hi> (<hi
                rend="italic">Falcon Sh.</hi>): There can be no doubt that the scene is laid in
              Antium. For (1) it was from Antium that Coriolanus received his commission, and he
              returns to report upon it; and (2) in l. 97 he speaks as though the Antiates alone
              were involved in the war. Further, in l. 59, the scene is called Aufidius's native
              town, and this was Antium. It is an additional argument that Plutarch makes him perish
              at Antium.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Gordon</hi>: Editors are divided whether to
              place this scene in Antium or Corioli. The solution seems to me to be this:
              Shakespeare meant the scene to be Antium, and wrote with Antium in his mind until he
              came to Aufidius's speech, ll. 109, 110. There he was carried away by the magnificent
              opportunity of placing &lsquo;Coriolanus in Corioli,&rsquo; and for the rest
              of the scene thought rather of Corioli than of Antium.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Case</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Arden Sh.</hi>): That the army should come back to a
              small town like Corioli seems most improbable, and ll. 96-98 must have been spoken in
              Antium, not in Corioli. There, not the Antiates but the Volscians would have been
              named. Mr Gordon's solution seems very reasonable.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap"
                >Tucker Brooke</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Yale Sh.</hi>: The text of this scene is
              inconsistent in locating it first at Antium, the Volscian capital, and later at
              Corioli. Professor Gordon's explanation is highly satisfactory. </p>

              cause. The use of &lsquo;watered&rsquo; is illustrated by a passage supplied
              by Mr Charles Crawford from a letter from Sir Francis Bacon to Sir George Villiers,
              August 12, 1616: &lsquo;After that the King shall have watered your new dignities,
              with the bounty of the lands which he intends you,&rsquo; etc. Some, including
              Craig, are confident that Aufidius wilfully misrepresents Coriolanus here, knowing
              well that &lsquo;He would not flatter Neptune for his trident, Or Jove for's power
              to thunder.&rsquo; At any rate even courtesy would seem flattery in the jealous

                <hi rend="italic">ear</hi> [the MS. correction], which means in its derivation, as
              well as in its use, to plough; therefore when Aufidius says that he had
              &lsquo;Holp to reap the fame Which he did <hi rend="italic">ear</hi> all
              his,&rsquo; he means that Coriolanus had ploughed the ground, intending to reap a
              crop of fame, which Aufidius had assisted him to harvest. The use of the word
              &lsquo;reap&rsquo; proves what was in the mind of the poet. It is needless to
              enumerate the places where Shakespeare employs the verb, to <hi rend="italic"
              >ear,</hi> in the sense of to plough.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi> (ed.

              old commentator's era. If Mr Singer's interpretation of the old commentator's <hi

              proof could be adduced that <hi rend="italic">end</hi> is a technical phrase in

              transposition necessary. But there is not the least necessity for this violence to the
              original text. Aufidius helped to reap the fame which Coriolanus made, in the end, all
                his.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">C. &amp; M. Cowden Clarke</hi> (<hi

              variously altered, but we take the sentence to be the elliptical form of a usual

              would be necessary in order to apply it to the case that we should not read
              &lsquo;he,&rsquo; but <hi rend="italic">we</hi>&mdash;&lsquo;Which <hi

              about this metaphor; and nothing in this passage but the inflection
              &lsquo;holpe&rsquo; is entirely obsolete, and that, of course, never stuck
              with anybody. The whole force of suspicion has fallen upon the unoffending verb, <hi
                rend="italic">end!</hi> Why, in the name of common sense? Aufidius says that he
              helped Coriolanus to reap the crop, that he endured with him &lsquo;the burden and
              heat of the day,&rsquo; but that Coriolanus <hi rend="italic">ended</hi> it, and
              made it all his own. Certainly no difficulty in this phraseology would be presented to
              the mind of the rudest midland farm-labourer. We may still hear the farmers of
              Worcestershire and Herefordshire employ that verb in a technical sense in speaking of
              their crops. <hi rend="italic">Ending</hi> a crop is gathering it. A well-ended crop

              once corrupted to &lsquo;end,&rsquo; of course a meaning is fitted to it, and
              it is interpreted of ending or finishing the harvest. In this sense it is still in use
              in Surrey, Sussex, Hallamshire, and probably elsewhere. The insertion of
              &lsquo;d&rsquo; after a liquid is frequent in common pronunciation. Hence
              &lsquo;vile&rsquo; becomes &lsquo;vild,&rsquo; and we know that

              modernising editors. Their only explanation is &lsquo;patronized,&rsquo; of
              which they give no example. It clearly is not the case that it here means, hire or pay
              wages to. [I regret that I must here take exception to Miss Porter. In the first
              place, if the Folio reading is more obscured by the modern spelling the editor of the
              Third Folio, not Rowe, is responsible. Secondly, no modern editor, as far as I know,
              has interpreted &lsquo;wadg'd&rsquo; or <hi rend="italic">wag'd</hi> as <hi
                rend="italic">patronized.</hi> Wright explains the whole line, &lsquo;rewarded

              Porter's writing the <hi rend="italic">N. E. D.</hi> had not extended as far as this
              word, but the <hi rend="italic">Century Dictionary</hi> records it
              (s.v.&dagger;6); in fact, under its definition &lsquo;to hire for

              is not that Coriolanus thought his favour a fair reward, but that he should have
              assumed the right of patronage at all. [Case quotes the same passage from North's <hi

              secured from the Romans. [This somewhat cryptic sentence may be derived from this
              passage in North: &lsquo;Tullus, having procured many of his confederacy, required
              Martius might be deposed from his estate to render up account to the Volsces of his
              charge and government. Martius, fearing to become a private man again under Tullus
              being general, . . . answered, he was willing to give up his charge, and would resign
              it into the hands of the lords of the Volsces, if they did all command him, as by all
              their commandment he received it.&rsquo; Thus the complaint of the 1 Lord is, that

              though the good in it has conquered, remains unchanged, and since his rival's plan is
              concerted before our eyes, we await with little suspense, almost indeed with
              tranquillity, the certain end. As it approaches it is felt to be the more inevitable
              because the steps which lead to it are made to repeat as exactly as possible the steps
              which led to his exile. His task, as then, is to excuse himself, a task the most
              repugnant to his pride. Aufidius, like the Tribunes then, knows how to render its
              fulfilment impossible. He hears a word of insult, the same that he heard
              then&mdash;&lsquo;traitor.&rsquo; It is followed by a sneer at the most
              sacred tears he ever shed, and a lying description of their effect on the bystanders;
              and his pride and his loathing of falsehood and meanness explode, as before, in
              furious speech. . . . As he turns on Aufidius the conspirators rush upon him, and in a
              moment, before the vision of his glory has faded from his brain, he lies dead. The
              instantaneous cessation of enormous energy (which is like nothing else in Shakespeare)
              strikes us with awe, but not with pity. </p>

              <hi rend="smallcap">MacCallum</hi> (p. 626): It is not as a martyr to retrieved
              patriotism that Coriolanus perishes, but as the victim of his own passion. In truth,
              the victory he won over himself under the influence of his mother, though real, is
              very incomplete. His piety to the hearth saves him from the superlative infamy of
              destroying his country, which is something, and even a good deal; but it is not
              everything; and beyond that it has no result, public or personal. On the contrary,
              Coriolanus' isolated and but partly justified act of clemency receives its comment
              from the motives that induced it, the troth-breach that accompanied it, and the rage
              in which he passed away. If, like his son with the butterfly, he did grasp honour at
              the close, it was disfigured by his rude handling. But at least he never belies his
              own great, though mixed, nature, and it is fitting that his death, needless but
              heroic, should have its cause in his nature and be such as his nature would select.
              Indeed, it is both his nemesis and his guerdon. For he would not be a </p>
            <p>Roman, he could not be a Volsce; what part could he have played in the years to come?
              Perhaps Shakespeare read in Philemon Holland's rendering the alternative account that
              Livy gives of the final scene: &lsquo;I find in Fabius, a most ancient writer,
              that he [Coriolanus] lived untill he was an old man: who repeateth this of him: that
              oftentimes in his latter daies he used to utter this speech: <hi rend="italic">A
                heavie case and most wretched, for an aged man to live banisht.</hi>&rsquo; At
              all events some such feeling as his regrets in this variant tradition suggest makes us
              prefer the version that Plutarch followed and that Shakespeare adapted. Coriolanus
              deserves to be spared the woes that the future has in store. As it is, he falls in the
              fullness of his power, inspired by great memories to greater audacity, and, no doubt,
              elated at the thought of challenging and outbraving death, when death is sure to
              win.&mdash; <hi rend="smallcap">Stanley Wood</hi>: Poetic justice requires that
              Coriolanus should die in order to make atonement for the wrongs he has committed in
              his life. His death has been more than once foreshadowed, by himself and by Aufidius.
              Our remaining interest is in the circumstances and in the manner of his death, and
              this we shall find to be such that when his mother hears of it she shall still hear
              nothing of him but what was like him formerly. His physical bravery remains with him
              to the last, and as he dies at the hands of the Volscian conspirators it seems to fall
              as a shroud around him. </p>

              either patrician or plebeian what is of a fine nature in Coriolanus. He has not been
              subjected as much as they to the worry of his pride and rage. Even when he most envies
              Coriolanus he can make a judgment of his character and career&mdash;as he does to
              the Lieutenant at the end of Act IV.&mdash;which is at once tolerant and wise, and
              which in itself is a most noble piece of poetry. It is given almost against his will,

              <hi rend="smallcap">J. W. Fortescue</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sh's England,</hi> vol. i,
              p. 116: <hi rend="italic">The Army</hi>): A special occasion for trailing a pike was a
              military funeral, a duty which the train-bands enjoyed immensely. The classical
              instance of a military funeral at St Paul's is that of Sir Philip Sidney in 1586.
              Shakespeare must have witnessed more than one; and hence at the close of <hi
                rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> we find Aufidius saying over the corpse of the hero,
              &lsquo;Trail your steel pikes.&rsquo; [In Lant's plates of Sir Philip Sidney's
              Funeral, which are reproduced accompanying this description, the pikes are shown

              <hi rend="smallcap">Figgis</hi> (p. 276): As the tragedies proceed in their course a
              change can be noticed coming over them, and it is <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> that
              makes the border-line of distinction. In <hi rend="italic">Hamlet, Othello,</hi> and
                <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> the conclusions are about as </p>
            <p>perplexing as they well may be. Everything ends in disorder and disaster; scarce
              anything is resolved on this earth, all things, even subsidiary perplexities, being
              dismissed to a further court for settlement. But in the tragedies that succeed, <hi
                rend="italic">Antony &amp; Cleopatra</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi>
              the ends are far more peaceful, owing to the fact that they fall to more of a
              conclusion. They are in no way so perplexed. In <hi rend="italic">Antony &amp;
                Cleopatra</hi> the judgment beyond is plainly hinted at, and so in a measure
              achieved. In <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> the end is not one of perplexity, but
              one of rest: Tullus Aufidius' words, together with something in Coriolanus that
              altogether loses our patience, make the end seem something complete in itself. </p>
