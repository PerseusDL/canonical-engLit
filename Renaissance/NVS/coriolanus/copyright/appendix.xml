<quote><p><hi rend="italic">The Tragedy of Coriolanus</hi> was first printed in the
Folio collection of 1623. It is entered in the <hi rend="italic">Stationers' Registers</hi> of that year
by the publishers of the folio as one of the copies &lsquo;not formerly entered to other
men.&rsquo; In this Folio edition it stands the first of the tragedies in the order of
paging; but this arrangement, as in every other case, was, in all likelihood, an
arbitrary one. The text is divided into acts and scenes, according to the modern
editions; and the stage directions are very full and precise. [After the first caption,
<hi rend="italic">Actus Primus, Sc&oelig;na Prima,</hi> there are no scene divisions throughout the play.&mdash;
<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>] With the exception of a few obvious typographical errors, such as invari-
ably occur even under the eye of an author when a book is printed from manu-
script, the text is wonderfully accurate.</p></quote>

for the time in the Folio of 1623; but in Act II, sc. iii. either the transcriber of
the manuscript or the compositor must have omitted a line, which Pope supplied
from conjecture (with the aid of North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi>), and which has ever since been
received into the text, because it is absolutely necessary to the intelligibility of
the passage. [See II, iii, 259.] <hi rend="smallcap">Ibid.</hi> (ed. ii.): It is printed in the folio with a

Every page of it is spotted with corruption. In several passages Mr Collier's
Folio of 1632 gives unwonted aid to conjecture in the restoration of the text; but
even with this help some of the confusion must be abandoned as hopeless.</p></quote>

<quote><p><hi rend="italic">The Tragedy of Coriolanus</hi> stands the second in the division
of tragedies, as originally published: the acts are regularly marked, but not the
scenes; the stage-directions are remarkably full and complete; while the text,
though very well printed in the main, has perhaps a larger number of difficult
and seemingly corrupt readings than any other in the volume. Some of these
readings have hitherto baffled and nonplussed all the resources of editorial ingenuity
and learning. Several of them, however, have, we think, at length been greatly
relieved, if not entirely removed, by the help of the manuscript corrections lately

discovered by Mr Collier in a copy of the Second Folio, which presents a greater
number of valuable new readings in this play than in any other where we have

<quote><p> The text of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> has a bad name. It is
one of those texts which editors call corrupt. Their efforts to restore it, to recover
out of the damage done by copyists and compositors the very words which Shake-
speare wrote, have left a hundred marks on every page of the play. Their foot-
notes bristle with improvements, and altogether there is such a twisting of lines,
such changing of forms, such tossing of commas, such triumphing and groaning as
obscurities yield or win the day, that an ordinary reader begins to wonder if the
wars of the Volces have not strayed into the margin among the notes. It is to be
feared that, like some other great events, this textual battle was hatched from a
very small egg. The editors, one encouraging another, have exaggerated both their
difficulties and their exploits. Much less has been done to improve the text than
their foot-notes give out, and much less was needed than has been done. They
found the play abrupt and irregular, full of fierce rapidities of speech and cultural
dissonance of metre. They have left it, after two centuries of tidying, not yet quite
neat, but neater and tidier certainly than it ever left its author's hands. They have
been indeed &lsquo;too good for it.&rsquo; They scotched it and notched it. They have put a
hook into the &lsquo;horn and noise of the monster&rsquo; and sent him into the world tame.
Now this may be to improve the play, but it is not to correct it. Editors have
assumed too readily that they were correcting errors when they were only making
a difficult play more readable. The play is rough; but it was not meant to be
smooth. It is difficult; but it was not meant to be easy. And it is certainly not
corrupt. A corrupt text should contain corrupt passages. But there are only
three such passages in the play&mdash;I, iii, 46; I, ix, 59, 60; II, iii, 259&mdash;and the last
of these is a slip.</p></quote>

<quote><p>The Folio text of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is excep-
tionally corrupt. The &lsquo;copy&rsquo; was obviously ill-written, although, from the fulness
of the stage-directions, it may be inferred that it was a transcript which belonged
to the theatrical manager. Despite the efforts of textual critics, several passages
remain barely intelligible.</p></quote>

<note anchored="yes" place="inline">[J. P. Collier printed for distribution among his private friends in 1874 a
treatise in three parts entitled <ref target="collier-1874" targOrder="U"> &lsquo;Trilogy&rsquo;</ref>; it was cast in the form of Conversation
between himself and two other fictitious characters on the subject of the MS.
Emendations in his Folio of 1632 and the treatment accorded these corrections
by recent editors. In his Preface he says: &lsquo;If the asperity of the notes and criti-
cisms of my adversaries have here and there tinged my style, or led me astray
from the narrow line of mere vindication, I am heartily sorry for it.&rsquo; This refers
to the sharp attacks made on him by Dyce and Singer. The many MS. corrections
in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> form the subject of one of the Conversations, and for that reason
alone I have thought it of interest to include this ensuing extract in the discussion
on the text of this Tragedy.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]</note>
<p></p>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> It is now more than a quarter of a century since you bought from
Rodd, the bookseller, the corrected copy of the Folio Shakespeare dated 1632;
and about twenty years since you published your volume of &lsquo;Notes and Emenda-
tions&rsquo; derived from it. Have you since had any reason to doubt their genuineness,
or to alter your opinion of their value?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> None to doubt their genuineness, but some for altering my opinion
as to the value of a few of the manuscript emendations. In my joy at my dis-
covery I was here and there disposed to give some of the proposed changes an
importance and a value which I now think does not really belong to them.
<pb n="590"/></p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> I am not at all surprised at that: it was natural, and to be expected;
but, surely, as to the great majority of them, and especially of those affecting the
sense of remarkable passages in the text, you have not altered the opinion in some
cases so emphatically expressed in your volume of &lsquo;Notes and Emendations&rsquo;
published in 1853.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> Certainly not. I am more than ever confirmed in my judgment as
to the value of a good many of them, if only by the use which subsequent editors of
Shakespeare have made of them.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> True; not a small number of the emendations have found their
way into the text of, I think, all impressions of Shakespeare since the year 1853.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> But some of them have been most violently resisted; and all sorts of
injurious epithets applied to them, and even to yourself personally.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> But the changes have been adopted nevertheless, so that they can
never again be excluded; they are now admitted to be the true language of the poet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> Seeing how my volume of &lsquo;Notes and Emendations&rsquo; has been treated,
some editors and would-be editors inveighing furiously, and without common
decency, against them, and yet after all most grudgingly admitting them, I have
sometimes thought that my better course would have been, first to print the
changes as mere suggestions on my part, and then afterwards to produce my old
corrected copy of the Folio 1632 in the justification.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> Or better still: if you had condescended to play the rogue, you
might have produced, as your own, all the indisputable improvements of Shake-
speare's text&mdash;improvements that now are sanctioned by the approbation of
everybody, readers or rival editors; and having thus been acknowledged as the
most gifted speculative annotator that ever existed, you might have destroyed
your corrected copy of the Folio 1632, and left your enemies to wonder how it had
happened that you alone had guessed at what, beyond all cavil, was the true
language of our great dramatist in some of his most notorious and admired
passages.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> Such, for instance, as which?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> Well, I hardly know where to choose; but take the grand speech in
&lsquo;Coriolanus&rsquo; (Act III, sc. i.), where the hero is furiously blaming the patricians
for yielding to the claims of the plebeians by giving them the contents of the
public granaries:
<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;Well, what then?</l>
<l>How shall this bisson multitude diges</l>
<l>The Senate's courtesy?&rsquo;</l>
</quote><bibl n="shak. cor 3.1">shak. cor 3.1.131</bibl></cit></p>
<p>The words &lsquo;bosom multiplied&rsquo; instead of bisson multitude (as the text must now
forever stand) have puzzled every editor of Shakespeare from the time of Rowe
to our own day; even Theobald was obliged to reprint &lsquo;bosom multiplied&rsquo; without
an attempted change; later endeavours, such as that of Malone, to explain &lsquo;bosom
multiplied&rsquo; as bosom multitudinous, have utterly failed; but the old Corrector of
the Folio 1632 puts the passage right at once, and shows that bosom was a mis-
print for &lsquo;bisson&rsquo; (the old word for blind), and multiplied a misprint for &lsquo;multi-
tude.&rsquo; The passage can never again be printed in any other words than those
substituted in his margin by the old Corrector of the Folio 1632.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> They certainly cannot be disputed; and you will see that Dyce (VI,
255, edit. 1864), without hesitation, calls it &lsquo;an excellent emendation.&rsquo; Singer,
too, says it is &lsquo;happy,&rsquo; and there can be no doubt about it.
<pb n="591"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> Singer so often inserts in his text important changes of the kind with-
out acknowledgment that his avowed consent to accept &lsquo;bisson multitude&rsquo; is
perhaps the more remarkable. However, we can hardly consider him in the rank
of an independent editor. It is quite certain that &lsquo;bosom multiplied&rsquo; will never
again make its appearance in any impression of Shakespeare to the end of time.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> I only produce it as a short and decisive proof of, I may say, the
inestimable value of some of the changes in the corrected Folio 1632, in answer
to Alton's demand for an instance.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> I admit the answer; and, were it wanted, we might confirm it by another
authority, if we may so call it. Of course you know what is entitled &lsquo;the Globe
Edition of the Works of Shakespeare,&rsquo; of which it is generally said that twenty or
even thirty thousand copies have been sold; and we need not wonder at it, con-
sidering its beauty and extraordinary cheapness: there we see &lsquo;bisson multitude&rsquo;
given as if it had always been Shakespeare's text, and &lsquo;bosom multiplied&rsquo; never
heard of, though it had been invariably printed &lsquo;bosom multiplied&rsquo; during the
course of two hundred and fifty years.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> I have not till now seen, though I have heard of, the &lsquo;Globe Shake-
peare.&rsquo; Do they not give any information that the old reading was bosom mul-
tiplied, and the new reading &lsquo;bisson multitude&rsquo;?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> Nothing of the sort; and it is the more surprising because they state
in the pref'ace that they mark by an &lsquo;obelus&rsquo; (&dagger;) such corrections as they intro-
duce in the text of the poet as it has been usually handed down to us. They some-
times keep their word in this particular, but by no means always; and only two
lines above that in which &lsquo;bisson multitude&rsquo; occurs they very properly alter
native to &lsquo;motive,&rsquo; yet give no hint of the change. This looks unfair, though I
dare say it was not meant so; but recollecting the enormous sale of &lsquo;the Globe
Edition,&rsquo; it was the more important that this and other emendations should be
clearly distinguished; we could not expect them to state that &lsquo;bisson multitude&rsquo;
was derived from &lsquo;Mr Collier's corrected Folio 1632,&rsquo; but they ought to have in-
formed the reader by the obelus that it was a new reading.</p>
<p>(Part iii, p. 11) </p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> There are many trifling points adverted to by various
editors that might be passed over entirely or, at all events, dismissed summarily.
Dyce has no fewer than 257 notes upon this drama, occupying nearly forty closely
printed pages, at least two-thirds of which might have been advantageously
omitted; and why are we to waste time upon them?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> And many of them are beyond the pale of our inquiry; we ought to
limit ourselves to those notes only which illustrate the manner in, and the extent
to, which he, in particular, has been indebted to the old Corrector of my Folio 1632.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> There are scores of places in his notes on &lsquo;Coriolanus&rsquo; where Dyce
has been compelled to mention and quote that surprising and, to many, unwelcome
volume.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> And of not a few of those we need say nothing, but, on the other hand,
there are nearly twenty places in which he has most unwillingly been driven to
admit his obligations to the old Corrector, having actually derived his text from
him, and from him only. In all those instances, and on that authority merely, he
has made his edition different from any that preceded it, excepting always your own.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> How often does he not say &lsquo;I here give the text of Mr Collier's
MS. Corrector&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;So Mr Collier's MS. Corrector&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I adopt the reading of Mr
Collier's MS. Corrector&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;This is the excellent emendation of Mr Collier's MS.
Corrector,&rsquo; etc.
<pb n="592"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> Besides the numerous places where he couples the old Corrector with
Hanmer, Mason, Ritson, Capell, and others, always taking care to put the Cor-
rector last, as if in truth they had all preceded him and he was merely a follower.
This is a course unworthy of Dyce, who had previously admitted, incautiously
perhaps, that the MS. Corrector had &lsquo;lived long before&rsquo; Pope, Theobald, Capell,
or any of the modern commentators.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> Dismissing that really trifling matter, let us look at the first emenda-
tion, of any importance, that he derived from your corrected folio.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> Just turn to Act I, sc. iii, and to the words &lsquo;at Grecian swords con-
temning.&rsquo; So I printed it conjecturally in my first edition of 1844, but Dyce, in
his first edition of 1857, at once refused &lsquo;contemning&rsquo; and printed contending from
the Second Folio, quoting in his support a writer in &lsquo;Blackwood's Magazine.&rsquo; But
what did he do in his second edition of 1864? He saw that I persevered in favour
of &lsquo;contemning,&rsquo; and that it was the emendation of the old Corrector of my Folio
1632, and on that authority alone, in his own teeth and in spite of Blackwood, he
adopted &lsquo;contemning,&rsquo; adding, fairly enough, the real source of the emendation.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> A remarkable instance of his absolute reliance upon that book which
has been the source of so many other improvements.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> But you had preferred &lsquo;contemning&rsquo; ten years before you discovered
it in your contemned and despised corrected folio, 1632. Now it must be the
text as long as Shakespeare is admired and reprinted; even the Globe Shakespeare
adopts the word, tho' as usual, and consistently with its plan perhaps, it gives no
notice of the improvement, or of the cause of it.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> In the next scene we have a strong proof of Dyce's irresolution; he
believed that
<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;Unheard of boils and plagues</l>
<l>Plaster you o'er&rsquo;</l>

was what the poet might have written, and yet Dyce dared not remove the cor-
ruption, though censuring Singer for declaring that it was &lsquo;very improbable.&rsquo;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> What say you to the expression &lsquo;To the pot, I warrant him&rsquo;?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> I admit that I was wrong in printing &lsquo;to the port&rsquo;; for I have since
found many good authorities for the vulgarism. Look at this from B. R.'s
(Barnabe Rich?) &lsquo;There is no remedy that one of you both must to the pot,
either the mayster or the man&rsquo;; and in G. Whetstone's &lsquo;Rock of Regard,&rsquo; 1576,
&lsquo;Their enemies soe did flie, or go to pott.&rsquo; Dyce is right there.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> It was your oversight; but in the passage &lsquo;Thou art lost Marcius,&rsquo;
Dyce says that &lsquo;lost,&rsquo; instead of left, was an emendation by Mr Grant White, when
he might have seen it with a note in your edition of 1844.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> It is a trifle of no moment; and Dyce gives me credit for &lsquo;More than
thy fame I envy,&rsquo; in the eighth scene, and for &lsquo;coverture for the wars&rsquo; instead of
overture; but they are both in the Corr. Fo. 1632.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> Then this brings us to Act II, sc. i, where in the speech of Menenius
we meet with some singular corruptions, and particularly the important word
first for thirst&mdash;&lsquo;the thirst complaint.&rsquo;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> For this correction I would willingly rely upon the common sense of
any reader; it is a misprint that, in truth, corrects itself. What can be the objec-
tion to these words from the mouth of the merry old man, descriptive of his own
character: &lsquo;I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of
hot wine, with not a drop of allaying Tyber in't, and to be something imperfect
<pb n="593"/>

in favouring the thirst complaint.&rsquo; Only substitute first for &lsquo;thirst&rsquo; and what
nonsense is made of it. The words &lsquo;thirst&rsquo; and first were so easily misheard, and
therefore misprinted; &lsquo;a-first&rsquo; for a-thirst is a very old corruption in the ballad
of &lsquo;The Friar and the Boy,&rsquo; and Mr Wright, the editor of a reprint of it in 1836,
quotes various instances in which a-first is put for &lsquo;a-thirst&rsquo;; while in Lazarus
Piot's &lsquo;Silvayn's Orator,&rsquo; 1596, containing the speech of the Jew on the pound of
flesh, the word &lsquo;thriftie&rsquo; is misprinted thirstie&mdash;&lsquo;Wherewith the father being dis-
pleased disinheriteth the thirstie son of his patrimonie&rsquo; (p. 202). Nothing could
be more likely than that &lsquo;thirst&rsquo; should be misprinted in various ways; and in
Tarlton's &lsquo;Tragical Discourses,&rsquo; 1567, Fo. 135, he speaks of &lsquo;glutting the lascivious
thrust of this ravynous apostat,&rsquo; viz., the monk to whom the story relates.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> Surely we may dispense with other proofs not merely because those
you have brought forward are so convincing, but because the error is so self-
evident. The word &lsquo;bisson,&rsquo; which occurs in the same speech, and afterwards in
a more remarkable passage, I see is spelt &lsquo;blisson&rsquo; by your favourite translator
Holland, on p. 334, of his &lsquo;Livy,&rsquo; where he tells us that Appius Claudius, the Censor,
was surnamed C&aelig;cus, that is, blisson or blind.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> That, I apprehend, is merely an error of the press in a book that has
very few blemishes of the kind. Your mention of Holland and his &lsquo;Livy&rsquo; reminds
me of a mistake I made in the next speech of Menenius, where I said, in my last
edition, that &lsquo;dismiss the controversy bleeding&rsquo; ought to be pleading. I was wrong;
the expression was almost technical in Shakespeare's day in reference to unfinished
lawsuits.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> How do you establish that? It has always seemed to me that to
&lsquo;dismiss the controversy pleading&rsquo; was the exact meaning of the poet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> However unwilling I may be, I must convict myself of being wrong
there. In Dr Wilson's &lsquo;Arte of Logicke,&rsquo; first printed in 1551, we read as follows:
&lsquo;The Judges seeing the matter so doubtfull and so hard to determine for either
partie, fearing to doe amisse, left the matter raw,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> &lsquo;bleeding,&rsquo; as in Shakespeare. The passage I have in my mind from Holland's &lsquo;Livy&rsquo; runs thus when a
lawsuit was undecided: &lsquo;for all now lieth bleeding, and in extreame hazard.&rsquo;
Dyce does not say I was mistaken, he only observes that &lsquo;Mr Collier's MS. Cor-
rector substitutes pleading.&rsquo; He had no authority on the point or he would cer-
tainly have adduced it. I only want to be just and to correct myself as well as
other people. As to &lsquo;the thirst complaint&rsquo; there cannot be a doubt.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> So I say of &lsquo;empyric phisique,&rsquo; often spelt so of old, while the com-
positor could make nothing of it but emperickquitique. It converts pure nonsense
into a very plain meaning.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> Next we come to &lsquo;the napless vesture of humility,&rsquo; printed in the
folios &lsquo;Naples vesture of humility,&rsquo; as if it had been brought from Naples to be
worn in Rome, and regarding which, and Mr Dyce's droll blunder in his edition
of &lsquo;Middleton&rsquo; (IV, 425), we have perhaps already said enough.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> Which may, however, properly introduce us to the &lsquo;woolvish tongue,&rsquo; as
it stands in the First Folio, while in the Second, tongue is altered to gowne. What
infinite trouble these two words &lsquo;woolvish tongue&rsquo; have given the commentators!
There can be no doubt, however, that tongue must be read togue or toge, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi>
toga; but what could they make of &lsquo;woolvish&rsquo;?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> Johnson tells us that it means hirsute, and Steevens says a great deal
about wolf in sheep's clothing. Dyce did not know what to do with the word,
and in his first edition of 1857 simply reprinted wolvish, although in 1853 my
<pb n="594"/>

volume of &lsquo;Notes and Emendations,&rsquo; founded upon the Corr. Fo. 1632, had offered
him the admirable word &lsquo;woolless,&rsquo; in entire consistency with &lsquo;napless,&rsquo; in an earlier
part of the tragedy. In 1857 he could not bring himself to adopt &lsquo;woolless&rsquo; on the
unwelcome authority of the old Corrector, and was content with wolvish, though
everybody but himself saw it was wrong.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> That was four years after your Vol. of &lsquo;Notes and Emendations&rsquo;
came out. What did Dyce do in 1864, when his second edition appeared?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> In the meantime my second edition of 1858 had been published with
&lsquo;woolless&rsquo; instead of wolvish, as applied to the &lsquo;togue,&rsquo; or toga, worn by Coriolanus;
and impartial people saw that was the very word wanted; even Dyce's &lsquo;afflictive
friends&rsquo; could not dispute it; and in consequence of this defect and others, to some
of which we have already adverted, he called in his edition of 1857, did what he
could to stop the circulation of copies that had got out into the world, and pub-
lished his edition of 1864. In 1864 he obliterated &lsquo;wolvish togue,&rsquo; and substituted
the very word he had before utterly rejected.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> Avowing fairly, however, that he was indebted for it to your old volume
of 1632.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> He could not well do otherwise, for even his friends deserted him; and
now, owing solely to your corrected and much abused folio, &lsquo;woolless togue&rsquo; must
inevitably stand as the language of Shakespeare.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> That, I take it, is quite certain. And now we may go on, without
noticing minor points, to the scene (Act III.) where Coriolanus in his fury against
the mob calls upon the Senators to &lsquo;revoke their dangerous bounty,&rsquo; as the Corr.
Fo. 1632 has it, and as the text must hereafter stand, in spite of all the poor de-
fences of the old reading, which Dyce upholds, though the new reading only requires
us to admit that &lsquo;revoke&rsquo; has been misprinted awake, and &lsquo;bounty&rsquo; lenity, two
very easy errors with the old compositor.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> Yes, something more must be done; for &lsquo;impotence&rsquo; must be sub-
stituted for ignorance, where the hero urges the Senators to conceal their want of
power.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> No very unlikely mistake we must also allow; seeing that the printer
of 1623 could just before compose woolvish instead of &lsquo;woolless,&rsquo; surely we may
suppose that he was careless enough to make the other mistakes, especially when
the corrections most aptly fall in with the whole spirit of the angry address of
Coriolanus.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> At the same time nobody is to be blamed for adhering to the old
text in every case where it can be fairly understood without the grossest violence
to our language. In this part of the tragedy, possibly, the original manuscript
was very corrupt, or the compositor of it unusually inattentive, because only a
few lines onward he presents us with what everybody, even Dyce and his coad-
jutors, allow to be a most egregious blunder.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> And which egregious blunder would have been preserved to the end of
time but for the old Corrector; you allude to bosom multiplied, instead of &lsquo;bisson
multitude,&rsquo; the indisputable language of the poet.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> I do; everybody has seen that the old text could not be right, yet no-
body, with all the ingenuity of all the commentators, could discover the true words
until I found them in my old despised and maligned folio of 1632. On that
authority I printed them in 1853, and even my bitterest opponents have ever since
been compelled to welcome them as &lsquo;an excellent emendation.&rsquo;</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> Must it not ever appear strange, I might say unaccountable, that
<pb n="595"/>

when we see so many invaluable emendations by the old Corrector, we cannot give
him credit for a few others not quite so palpable?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> That, to my mind, is an unanswerable logical inference.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> Irresistible. Thus, in the second scene of this very Act, is it not more
likely that Volumnia (whose entrance, by the way, Dyce alters at the sole instance
of the old Corrector) should impatiently address Coriolanus as &lsquo;O, son, son, son!&rsquo;
than as &lsquo;O, sir, sir, sir!&rsquo;?</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> Unquestionably.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> And we may feel even more certain about the inserted line,
<cit><quote><l>
&lsquo;To brook control without the use of anger,&rsquo;</l>
</quote><bibl n="shak. cor 3.2">shak. cor 3.2.31</bibl></cit>
not merely because it is found in the margin of my Folio 1632, but because common
sense requires the addition.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> Dyce admits that &lsquo;the passage is obscure,&rsquo; and that the additional
line makes it clear, yet, with childish obstinacy, I must say, rejects it. As to the
change of carriage for &lsquo;courage&rsquo; in Act III, sc. i, we need here say nothing, having
already shown the blunder into which Dyce fell regarding it when we were exam-
ining <hi rend="italic">Henry VI,</hi> Part 3.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> Dyce cannot refuse the important change in Act IV, sc. i, &lsquo;Whose
house, whose bed, whose meal,&rsquo; etc., simply adding &lsquo;So Mr Collier's MS. Cor-
rector.&rsquo; All the rest of his notes are comparatively trifling, now adopting and
now rejecting small improvements, and in one case absolutely recalling an emenda-
tion he had inserted in his first edition, acting throughout upon no intelligible
principle.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Newman.</speaker><p> Only remark the difficulty in which he involves himself as to &lsquo;cheer&rsquo;
or chair, five lines from the end of Act IV.; he owns that the text is very much cor-
rupted, quotes various suggestions by as many editors, and ends by refusing the
very word (only cheer instead of &lsquo;chair&rsquo;) which clears away all obscurity.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Alton.</speaker><p> But that word, you must remember, was contained in the odious volume
upon the representations of which you so much and so justly rely.</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Collier.</speaker><p> Dyce's later notes to this tragedy merit no particular comment; he
is generally at variance with other editors, and sometimes with himself, and resorts
to any authorities rather than to the Corr. Fo. 1632. We may just remark, as to
the words (Act V, sc. v.) &lsquo;Which he did end all his,&rsquo; that nobody seems aware that
&lsquo;end,&rsquo; in Dyce's extracts from the Hereford Times (note to what authorities he is
driven), means that a wheat-rick is &lsquo;well-ended&rsquo; because the end, top, or apex of
it is not made up, as it sometimes was, of stubble or stover, but of as good sheaves
of corn as the whole body of the stack.

<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> to the year 1609, and thus it appears also in his own edition of 1790.
Malone gives for this arbitrary date no reasons other than, that as the other

<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> naturally follows <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Antony &amp; Cleopatra.</hi> In his final

date one year and assigns <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> to 1610. Abandoning his former reasons
<pb n="596"/>
for accepting 1609 as the date of composition he says: 

<cit><quote><p>&lsquo;Cominius, in his panegyric

In Ben Jonson's <hi rend="italic">Silent Woman,</hi> Act V, Sc. last, we find (as Mr Steevens has ob-
served) the same phraseology: &ldquo;You have <hi rend="italic">lurch'd</hi> your friends of the better half
<hi rend="italic">of the garland.</hi>&rdquo; I formerly thought this a sneer at Shakespeare; but have lately
met with nearly the same phrase in a pamphlet by Thomas Nashe, and suppose it
to have been a common phrase of the time.

<note anchored="yes" place="foot"><cit><quote><p>But in Nashe there is only
the word &lsquo;lurch,&rsquo; which is of frequent occurrence, and the combination of this
with &lsquo;the garland&rsquo; by Ben Jonson seems to me to indicate that he had Shakespeare's

inclined to attach to the coincidence more weight than Malone felt himself justified

<note anchored="yes" place="inline">[See note by Malone, II, ii, 113.&mdash;
<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]</note> 

This play is ascertained to have been written after the publication of
Camden's <hi rend="italic">Remaines,</hi> in 1605, by a speech of Menenius in the first Act, in which
he endeavors to convince the seditious populace of their unreasonableness by
the well-known apologue of the members of the body rebelling against the belly.
This tale Shakespeare certainly found in the <hi rend="italic">Life of Coriolanus</hi> as translated by
North, and in general he has followed it as there given; but the same tale is also
told of Adrian the Fourth by Camden in his <hi rend="italic">Remaines,</hi> p. 199, under the head of
<hi rend="italic">Wise Speeches,</hi> with more particularity; and one or two of the expressions, as well
as the enumeration of the functions by each of the members of the body, appear
to have been taken from that book.</p>
<p>In Camden the tale runs thus: <cit><quote>&ldquo;All the members of the body conspired against
the stomach, as against the swallowing gulfe of all their labours; for whereas the
eies beheld, the eares heard, the handes laboured, the feete travelled, the tongue
spake, and all partes performed their functions; onely the stomache lay ydle and
consumed all. Hereuppon they joyntly agreed al to forbeare their lazie and
publike enemy. One day passed over, the second followed very tedious, but the
third day was so grievious to them all, that they called a common counsel. The
eyes waxed dimme, the feete could not support the body; the armes waxed lazie,
the tongue faltered, and could not lay open the matter. Therefore they all with
one accord desired the advice of the heart. There Reason layd open before
them,&rdquo;</quote><bibl></bibl></cit> &amp;c.</p>
<p>The heart is called by one of the citizens, &ldquo;the counsellor-heart&rdquo;; and in making
the counsellor-heart the seat of the brain or understanding, where Reason sits
enthroned, Shakespeare has certainly followed Camden.</p>
<p>The late date which I have assigned to <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> derives likewise some sup-
port from Volumnia's exhortation to her son, whom she advises to address the
Roman people&mdash;

<cit><quote><l>&ldquo;&mdash;now humble as the ripest mulberry.</l>
<l>Which cannot bear the handling.&rdquo;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 3.2">shak. cor 3.2.80</bibl></cit></p>
<p>In a preceding page I have observed that mulberries were not much known in
England before the year 1609. Some few mulberry-trees, however, had been
brought from France and planted before that period, and Shakespeare, we find,
had seen some of the fruit in a state of maturity before he wrote <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi>&rsquo;</p>

<quote><p>I cannot agree with Mr Malone in ranking <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens,
Antony and Cleopatra,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> among the later productions of our author.
Of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> I have already declared it to be my opinion that it was
a very early performance, and I make no doubt but that <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> was written
soon after it. For though Dr Johnson has with great truth observed that the
latter is a very amusing play, and embellished with great diversity of character,
yet is it accompanied with a multitude of metrical faults almost equal in number
to those of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra.</hi> The lines are always those of a young poet
who is scarce a master of numbers, and are often made up in a manner which to
a musical ear is ridiculous and disgusting. It was probably written a short time
before <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens,</hi> since both these pieces abound in faults of the same com-
plexion. There is in both an unskilful and sometimes a laughable confusion of
British with Roman and Athenian customs, many anachronisms, many broken
and ill managed lines, and a dissolute mixture of verse and prose. Add to this
that the proper names in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> are often introduced in a manner truly awk-
ward and bungling. It is nevertheless a performance of considerable merit.
It has passages of true sublimity and poetical excellence; and here and there
surprises us with a few of those delicate touches of nature by which the author
renders himself so irresistible in his appeal to the heart. <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi> takes
place of it only as being a piece more correct in its metre and abounding more in
observations drawn from nature.</p></quote>

<quote><p> This Tragedy, which is said by
Johnson to be one of the most amusing of our author's performances, was neither
entered in the Stationers' Registers nor printed till the publication of the First
Folio, in 1623. The writing of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> has been assigned, though with a hesi-
tating tone, to the year 1610. Mr Malone seems to have proved, with some
acuteness, indeed, that the speech of Menenius, in the first act, whereby he endeav-
ored to convince the seditious populace of the unreasonableness of their clamours,
on the account of the scarcity, by the apologue of the several members of the body
rebelling against the belly, was copied from Camden's <hi rend="italic">Remains</hi> rather than from
North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch.</hi> Yet, this proof goes only the length of showing, that as Camden's
work was published in 1605, Shakspeare must have written his <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> sub-
sequent to that publication; we are still left to enquire, even admitting this proof
in its full extent, for the particular year.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> opens with the entry of a company of mutinous citizens, who are
&lsquo;all resolved rather to die than to famish.&rsquo; Caius Marcius, being deemed by
them the chief enemy of the people, is, by a general verdict, sentenced, tumultu-
ously, to death; the first citizen crying out: &lsquo;Let us kill&rsquo; him; and we'll have corn
enough, at our &lsquo;own price.&rsquo; Menenius, when he came to speak to the citizens,
remarks:
<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;&mdash;For your wants;</l>
<l>Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well</l>
<l>Strike at the Heaven with your staves, as lift them</l>
<l>Against the Roman state:</l>

<l>The Gods, not the patricians, make it.&rsquo;</l>
</quote><bibl n="shak. cor 1.1">shak. cor 1.1.69</bibl></cit></p>
<p>The dearth is afterwards acknowledged, in the senate-house, to be great. Now,
the fact is, that the years 1608 and 1609 were times of great dearth; though the

<pb n="598"/>

first was a year of greater dearth than the last.

tonshire, on account of inclosures, in May, 1607.</note>

<note anchored="yes" place="foot">Ib., 39.</note>
It is said, in Raleigh's <hi rend="italic">Remains,</hi> that two millions sterling were sent out during
those two dear years for the importation of corn. The tragedy turns upon the
existing dearth. And, therefore, the play was probably written in 1609, while the
pressure was yet felt.</p>
<p>Mr Malone tries, indeed, to support his own epoch of the year 1610 by saying
that mulberry trees were not much known in England before the year 1609; Mr
Steevens has some doubt, with regard to this position, about the mulberries. But
the books upon horticulture, which were published during the reign of Elizabeth,
had made the mulberry tree sufficiently familiar to our poets of every kind. Among
several elegies on Sir Philip Sydney there is a pretty poem, by Mathew Roydon,
which was published in <hi rend="italic">The Ph&oelig;nix Nest,</hi> in 1503, and which speaks of&mdash;
<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;Alcides speckled poplar tree,</l>
<l>The palme that monarchs do obtain,</l>
<l>With love juice stain'd the Mulberie,</l>
<l>The fruit that dews the poet's braine,</l>
<l>And Phillis philbert there away,</l>
<l>Compar'd with myrtle and the bay.&rsquo;</l>
</quote><bibl></bibl></cit></p>
<p>The fact, however, is that King James, in order to encourage the breeding of
silk worms, sent circular letters all over England, in 1609, to incite the inhabitants
to plant the mulberry tree. These letters, probably, induced Shakspeare, while he
was writing his <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> to draw a comparison, from what was already known
to graffers, and to poets:

unemployed for the last seven years of his life. We hold that his last years were
devoted to these plays. The proof which Chalmers offers that <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> was
written in 1609 is one of the many ingenious absurdities with which he has sur-
rounded the question of the chronological order of Shakspere's plays. The citizens,
he says, are resolved rather to die than to famish&mdash;they require corn cheap; there
is a dearth. He adds, very gravely, &lsquo;Now the fact is, that the years 1608 and 1609
were times of great dearth. . . . And therefore the play was probably written in
1609 while the pressure was yet felt.&rsquo; We say, now the fact is, the original story
turns upon the dearth. In North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> we have the causes assigned &lsquo;which
made the extreme dearth&rsquo;; and Plutarch also tells us there was great scarcity of
corn within the city. If Shakspere found the dearth in the original story, what
could the dearth of 1608 possibly have to do with the mode in which he drama-
tized it?</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>The several passages in this play which are difficult of explanation
are not so much so on account of misprints, although these are not lacking, as on
account of the involved and elliptical style, which is characteristic of Shakespeare's
last period. And to this period, which begins about the year 1608, <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>
undoubtedly belongs; and while no definite year is furnished us by any notice

<p>It is with regret that I pass from the question of the date of the play with so

excellence of the play in itself renders it desirable to fix it to a year, but from the

when he embodied in living action this illustration of the virtues and the vices that

<quote><p> As to the date of the writing of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> we have no external evi-
dence whatsoever. The internal evidence of metre, diction, and temper refers it
to the Poet's latest period of composition. In all the qualities of style and versi-
fication it clearly falls into the same class with <hi rend="italic">The Tempest, The Winter's Tale,</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">King Henry VIII.</hi> in being as nearly like them as the difference of the subject-
matter would readily admit. Malone, accordingly, assigns the year 1610 as the
probable date of the writing. We should be strongly inclined to place it some
three or four years later, partly from the ease and texture of the workmanship
itself, and partly from the tradition that Shakespeare continued to write for the
stage after his retirement to Stratford. The most, however, that we can affirm
with any great degree of confidence is that <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> was written somewhere
between 1610 and the time of the Poet's death, which, as every reader ought to
know, took place in April, 1616.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Mr Halliwell&mdash;for that is still his name to Shaksperians, though he is now by law a
Phillipps&mdash;had long promist me a Letter on the date of the Roman Plays. But
family-business, and Stage- and Shakspere-searches, having prevented him from
writing the letter, he was good enough to tell me last Wednesday-week, June 17,
what he had intended to write, namely, that on comparing the different early
editions&mdash;1579, 1595, 1603, 1612&mdash;of Sir Thomas North's englishing of Amyot's
French translation of Plutarch's Lives, to find out which of these editions Shakspere
used for his Roman plays, he (Mr Halliwell) had noticed many small differences
between these editions of North, and had in one case, in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> hit on a word,
&lsquo;vnfortunate,&rsquo; altered by the 1612 edition from the former one's &lsquo;vnfortunatly,&rsquo;
which &lsquo;vnfortunate&rsquo; was the word used by Shakspere in his Tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi>
This was therefore <hi rend="italic">prim&acirc; facie</hi> evidence that Shakspere used the 1612 edition of
North for his <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> if not for his other Roman Plays. Here are the ex-

<p>Coupling this fact with the other that Mr Paton claims to have establisht,
namely, that Shakspere's own copy of the 1612 edition of North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch,</hi> with
his initials W. S., is now in the Greenock Library, we have a strong <hi rend="italic">prim&acirc; facie</hi>
case for the use of that edition by Shakspere in his <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus;</hi> for, as Dyce well
says, this Play &lsquo;is proved by the style to have been one of the author's latest
compositions.&rsquo; Now, as we know at present no other allusion or entry to fix the
date of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> we must all be grateful to Mr Halliwell for his discovery of
the present one. But is the evidence anything more than <hi rend="italic">prim&acirc; facie?</hi> Without
doubt, Shakspere may have alterd the &lsquo;vnfortunately&rsquo; of the earlier editions, to
the happier &lsquo;vnfortunate&rsquo; of his text, from his own instinct and ear, without
seeing the edition of 1612, just as he altered, by ear, &lsquo;the naughtie seede and
cockle of insolencie and sedition&rsquo; (North, p. 229, ed. 1612) of the earlier editions
(the 1595, at least) into

the deviation is, and how it was practically necessitated by the metre, we see what
a poor criterion it is of the date of production. Moreover, precisely the opposite
conclusion might be drawn from a comparison of North's translation with other
details of the play. In the fourth Act (sc. 5) we find, for example,
<cit>
<quote><l>&ldquo;&mdash;For if</l>
<l>I had feared death, of all men i' the world</l>
<l>I would have 'voided thee; but in mere spite</l>

<p>In all later editions the italicised words are omitted, &ldquo;with desire to be revenged&rdquo;

<p>We have, therefore, no occasion to abandon 1608 on that ground, and we have
certainly no need to do so for the sake of a fanciful approximation of the position
of Coriolanus to that of James at the dissolution of Parliament in 1614.</p>
<p>Thus much, at any rate, can be declared with absolute certainty, that the anti-
democractic spirit and passion of the play sprang from no momentary political
situation, but from Shakespeare's heart of hearts. We have watched its growth
with the passing of years. A detestation of the mob, a positive hatred of the mass
as mass, can be traced in the faltering efforts of his early youth. We may see its
workings in what is undoubtedly Shakespeare's own description of Jack Cade's
rebellion in the Second Part of <hi rend="italic">Henry VI.,</hi> and we divine it again in the conspicuous
absence of all allusion to Magna Charta displayed in <hi rend="italic">King John.</hi>&rsquo;</p></quote><bibl></bibl></cit>

regard to minor characters, for instance, between the feeble and pompous gar-

the fact that there is no entry of it on the <hi rend="italic">Stationers' Register,</hi> coupled with the
circumstance that after 1609 no entry (with the single exception of <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> in 1621)

<quote><p>In the Register of the Stationers' Com-
pany for Nov. 8, 1623, <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is enumerated as one of sixteen plays of which
copies had not been formerly entered to other men. Of the date of its composi-
tion nothing is known. It is conjectured that it may have been written from about
1608 to 1610, and although the evidence is not sufficiently strong for any positive
conclusion, it appears that these limits represent with sufficient accuracy the time
to which the play belongs, corresponding roughly to the close of the third period
in Shakespeare's career of authorship. Malone, in his essay on the &lsquo;Chronological
Order of Shakespeare's Plays,&rsquo; assigned <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> to the year 1610, but in his
notes to the play itself he puts it to 1609. He seems to have been guided to the
latter date by a theory that mulberries were not much known in England before
1609, and that therefore the comparison in III, ii, 98, 99, to
<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;The ripest mulberry</l>
<l>That will not hold the handling,&rsquo;</l>
</quote><bibl n="shak. cor 3.2">shak. cor 3.2.98</bibl></cit></p>
<p>could not have been written previously to that date. But Shakespeare was familiar
with mulberries at least fifteen years before, as is evident by the mention of them
in <hi rend="italic">Venus and Adonis,</hi> 1103, and <hi rend="italic">Midsummer Night's Dream,</hi> III, i, 170; and a reference 
<pb n="604"/>

to Gerarde's <hi rend="italic">Herball</hi> (1597) will shew that the mulberry-tree was well known
in England before the end of the sixteenth century. It is quite true that in 1609
especial attention was called to it by an attempt made by the King to encourage
the breeding of silkworms, and &lsquo;there were many hundred thousands of young
Mulberrie trees brought out of France, and planted in many Shires of this land&rsquo;
(Stow's <hi rend="italic">Annales,</hi> ed. Howes, 1615, p. 894).</p>
<p>But to assume that, in consequence of this, Shakespeare wrote the line which
has just been quoted is to infer too much; for if mulberry-trees were first planted
in England in 1609 he would have had very little opportunity of observing how the
fruit ripened and hung before writing his play or even before his own death seven
years after, for the mulberry does not bear fruit till the tree is of a certain age.
In all probability, however, he had a mulberry-tree in his own garden at New Place,
Stratford, which he bought in 1597, whether it was the tree of which relics are still
shewn or not.</p></quote></cit></div2>

no external notice. Our modern poet (Freytag), who has perhaps the finest per-

says besides that the cumulative construction of the first scene and act is abso-

greatness of composition of <hi rend="italic">Macbeth.</hi> The commencement of elliptical and in-
volved construction in language is manifest soon after the time of <hi rend="italic">Macbeth.</hi> This
is the last and highest point of Shakespeare's poetical development. Directly
after that there begins to be perceived a gradual decline of poetical craft, until in
<hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi> the last period has already begun to
mark clearly the ageing poet, that is, from 1608 to about 1609.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>We may, if we like, revert to the
old belief that in &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; Shakespeare took a formal leave of the stage, that
his magic staff was broken along with Prospero's, and that the wondrous book,
drowned &lsquo;deeper than did ever plummet sound,&rsquo; was no other than his own. A
worthier consummation of the great magician's career cannot be desired; and though
&lsquo;Henry the Eighth&rsquo; was probably later than &lsquo;The Tempest,&rsquo; being described as
a new play in June, 1613, Fletcher's share in it is so considerable that it hardly
counts. One of Shakespeare's greatest plays, however, may have been later still.
&lsquo;Coriolanus,&rsquo; to our apprehension, manifestly reflects the feelings of a conservative
observer of the contests between James and his refractory Parliaments. Two such
conflicts occurred in Shakespeare's time, in 1610 and 1614. The former date would
at first sight seem the more probable. But a minute circumstance observed by
Mr Halliwell suggests, though it does not quite prove, that Shakespeare read North's
&lsquo;Plutarch&rsquo; for this drama in the edition of 1612; and it is worthy of remark that
he is known to have been in London in November, 1614, just at the time when a

new play would begin to be rehearsed in preparation for the Christmas holidays.

<quote><p>Shakespeare's mother was buried on the 9th of September,
1608. He had travelled about the country of late, playing with his company,
from the middle of May until far into the autumn, during which period court and
aristocracy were absent from the capital.</p>
<p>In the midst of the prevailing gloom and bitterness of his spirit this fresh blow
fell upon him, and, out of his weariness of life as his surroundings and experiences
showed it to him, recalled this one mainstay to him&mdash;his mother. He remembered
all she had been to him for forty-four years, and the thoughts of the man and the
dreams of the poet were thus led to dwell upon the significance in a man's life of
this unique form, comparable to no other&mdash;his mother.</p>
<p>Thus it was that, although his genius must follow the path it had entered upon
and pursue it to the end, we find, in the midst of all that was low and base in his
next work, this one sublime mother-form, the proudest and most highly wrought
that he has drawn&mdash;Volumnia.</p>
<p>The tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> was first published in 1623 in the folio edition, but 1608
is the generally accepted date of its production, partly because a speech in Ben
Jonson's <hi rend="italic">The Silent Woman</hi> (1609) seems to indicate a reminiscence of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi>
and partly because many different critics concur in the opinion that its style and
versification point to that year.</p>
<p>How came this work to emerge from the depths of all the discontent, despond-
ency, hatred of life, and contempt for humanity which went at this time to make
up Shakespeare's soul? He was angry and soured, and the sources of his em-
bittered feelings are embodied in his plays, seeking outlet now under one, now under
another form. In <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> it was the relation of the sexes; here it is
social conditions and politics.</p>
<p>His point of view is as personal as it well could be. Shakespeare's aversion to
the mob was based upon his contempt for their discrimination, but it had its deepest
roots in the purely physical repugnance of his artist nerves to their plebeian at-
mosphere. It was obvious in <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi> that the irritation with public
stupidity was at its height. He now, for the third time, finds in his Plutarch a
subject which not only responds to the mood of the moment but also gives him
an opportunity for portraying a notable mother; and he is irresistibly drawn to
give his material dramatic style.</p>
<p>It is the old traditional story of Coriolanus, great man and great general, who,
in the remote days of Roman antiquity, became involved in such hopeless conflict
with the populace of his native city, and was so roughly dealt with by them in
return, that he was driven, in his bitterness, to reckless deeds.</p>
<p>Was it Shakespeare's intention to allude to the strained relations existing be-
tween James and his Parliament? Does <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> represent an aristocratically-
minded poet's side-glance at the political situation in England? I fancy it does.
Heaven knows there was little resemblance between the amazingly craven and
vacillating James and the haughty, resolute hero of Roman tradition, who fought
a whole garrison single handed. Nor was it personal resemblance which sug-
gested the comparison, but a general conception of the situation as between a
beneficent power on the one hand and the people on the other. He regarded the
latter wholly as a mob, and looked upon their struggle for freedom as mutiny, pure
and simple.</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p> Although the main current of tradition
respecting Shakespeare may be accepted as throwing real light on Shakespeare
the man, it contributes hardly anything to illustrate Shakespeare the author. It
is chiefly derived from Stratford, and but few of the people of Stratford can ever
have seen his plays performed, nor can it be thought that First Folios were at
any time very common among them. If the local tradition can tell us anything
about the dramas, it must be on some point that brings these into connection with
the poet's native place, as in the tradition preserved by the Rev. John Ward, Vicar
of Stratford in the latter part of the seventeenth century, that Shakespeare when
living at New Place regularly supplied the London stage with two plays a year.</p>
<p>The existence of a tradition to this effect is unquestionable. It comes to us
from the man of all others most likely to have heard it, and least likely to have
invented or disfigured it. But its authenticity is another matter. It is not,
and it hardly could be, confirmed by any external testimony. The only way of
testing it is to enquire whether it agrees with what we already know respecting
the dramatic productiveness of Shakespeare's latter years; and whether it does or
does not involve any chronological impossibilities.</p>
<p>As respects the first point, the tradition is entirely in harmony with a remark-
able phenomenon attending Shakespeare's later dramatic work which has not
yet attracted sufficient attention. This is the extent to which he endeavours to
diminish the labour of dramatic composition. In every play known with cer-
tainty to have belonged to his later period, <hi rend="italic">The Winter's Tale</hi> only excepted, re-
course is had to some device tending to save trouble to the author. In <hi rend="italic">Troilus
and Cressida,</hi> as now generally admitted, he revives a former play. <hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi>
is much the shortest of his dramas. Parts of <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline</hi> seem to be from another
hand. In <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> he follows Plutarch, and, although
with exquisite judgment, transcribes freely from his author. In <hi rend="italic">Pericles</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Timon</hi> he either adapts an old play, completes the work of a contemporary, or
hands his own drafts over to be pieced out by another. In <hi rend="italic">Henry the Eighth</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">The Two Noble Kinsmen</hi> (if he had any hand in the latter) he collaborates with
Fletcher. Except for the use of Plutarch in <hi rend="italic">Julius Caelig;sar,</hi> and of Holinshed in
the English historical plays, there is no trace in the earlier works of the procedure
which we find so nearly universal in the later.</p>
<p>The causes of this comparative slackness are in some measure obvious. Shake-
speare had had enough of literary distinction; his share in his theatre made him
independent of the proceeds of his pen; living more and more at Stratford he was
gradually losing touch with the stage, and becoming a country gentleman. The
addition of another reason may seem a transgression of Newton's injunction not
to assign more causes than are necessary to explain the phenomena. It must,
nevertheless, be allowed that the tradition reported by Ward fits in admirably
with the acknowledged cause for resort to extraneous aid. It would further
solve the question why, when so many motives co-operated to render him indiffer-
ent to the stage, Shakespeare did not retire from it, but, so far as regards the
number of his pieces, evinced even more fertility than at any previous epoch. The
obligation he had contracted would pull both ways. Its fulfilment would sometimes
be irksome, but would always be necessary. The natural resource would be the
employment of any device by which the dramatist's labour might be diminished
without lowering the standard of his art. A close analogy would be the conduct
of Pope when, finding that no version of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> could enhance the fame he
had won by the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> he turned a portion of the work over to Fenton and Broome.
<pb n="607"/>
</p>
<p>Ward's tradition, therefore, seems to harmonise with indubitable facts, and it
does not require us to modify our estimate either of Shakespeare or of his plays
in the smallest degree, except as regards chronology. The labour-saving tendency
of his later period, although sufficient attention has not been paid to it, must be
recognised as undeniable; and an obligation to produce two plays a year with or
without the goodwill of Minerva affords as plausible a way of accounting for it as
can be conceived.</p>
<p>A few words may be said about <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> the present writer in the first edition
of his essay on <hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi> having hazarded the opinion that it might be as late
as 1614. The arguments of Professor Brandes have convinced him that this theory
is untenable, while at the same time he must continue to think that the drama
has a distinct political tendency, bespeaking its production at a period of political
excitement. Such excitement prevailed during the contests between James I.
and his Parliament in 1610 and 1611, terminated by the dissolution in February of
the latter year. The play, as Brandes points out, is strongly antidemocratic, and
breathes exactly the spirit with which such a breach between the executive and
legislative authorities might be expected to inspire a conservative statesman.
Brandes places it in 1608, but to the present writer the difference in spirit and
execution seems to forbid such close juxtaposition with <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra,</hi>
which we know to have been produced in or about that year.</p>
<p>It may be that in this and other determinations of date criticism has relied too
exclusively upon the metrical test, which will seem to many conclusive as regards
the period of <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> as well as that of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi> This test is
indeed a most important element in the question of chronology, but is itself sub-
ject to limitation. It is too often forgotten that the preponderance of single or
double endings is partly governed by the character of the play. The double
ending, communicating a buoyant elasticity to the verse in virtue of the catalectic
syllable, is more appropriate to lively spirits and enthusiastic romance; while the
close ending rather befits tragic passion and solemn pathos. The character,
therefore, of most of Shakespeare's later compositions&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Cymbeline, The Winter's
Tale, The Tempest</hi>&mdash;is sufficient reason for the growing fondness for double endings
which they display, while he would instinctively recur to a stricter system of versi-
fication when he had to deal with a Macbeth or a Coriolanus.</p>
<p>We conclude, therefore, that the tradition recorded by Ward is intrinsically
probable, that it explains some remarkable phenomena connected with Shake-
speare's later plays, and that it might very well be accepted if we could see our
way to bring the dates of <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> a few years lower. Quite inde-
pendently of Ward's tradition there is, we think, sufficient reason for reconsidering
the accepted chronology of these dramas, although it may never be possible to
arrive at an entirely satisfactory solution of the question. Assuming provisionally
that Ward is to be relied upon, and that Shakespeare did for some time contribute
to the stage at the rate of two plays a year, we append a table showing the most
probable order of their production:

<quote><p>Internal evidence points with no uncertain
finger to the late months of 1608 or early months of 1609 as the period of the
play's birth.</p>
<p>Ben Jonson's <hi rend="italic">Silent Woman,</hi> which is known to have been first acted in 1609,
seems to echo a phrase of Shakespeare's play. In II, ii, 105 Cominius says of the
hero's feats in youth that &lsquo;he lurch'd [<hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> deprived] all swords of the garland.&rsquo;
The phrase has an uncommon ring and it would be in full accordance with Jonson's
habit to have assimilated it when he penned the sentence, &lsquo;Well, Dauphine,
you have lurched your friends of the better half of the garland&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">Silent Woman,</hi>
V, iv, 227, 228). It is difficult to take seriously the suggestion that 1612 must
be the date of composition because in a new edition, first published in that year,
of North's translation of Plutarch's <hi rend="italic">Lives,</hi> a passage which had previously read
&lsquo;How more unfortunately than all living women&rsquo; was altered to &lsquo;How more un-
fortunate than all living women,&rsquo; in which shape the line figures in Shakespeare's
play (V, iii, 97). It is fatuous to deny Shakespeare the power of making for him-
self (without recourse to the 1612 edition of North) a correction which metrical
exigencies made almost imperative.</p>
<p>The tragedy forms with <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> a virtual trilogy
which is based in its main features on Plutarch's biographical narratives of Roman
history. Although Coriolanus' career belongs to a far earlier period of history
than either of the two companion pieces, there is reason to believe that it was
undertaken last. The irregularities of metre, the ellipses of style, closely associate
it with <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> and separate it by a wide interval from <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar.</hi>
But alike in prosody and verbal construction, <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> seems to accentuate the
peculiarities of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra,</hi> and encourage the inference that it followed
rather than <hi rend="italic">preceded</hi> that great tragedy of passion. Statistics show that weak or
unaccented syllables, the presence of which at the end of lines marks for the most
part a new departure in <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra,</hi> are perceptibly greater in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi>
A similar ratio of increase may be assigned to the syntactical ellipses and harsh
contractions of language. It cannot be asserted that the dramatist's thought flows
through <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> with any such distinctive acceleration of pace as positively to
indicate a precise sequence in workmanship. Rather the flashing intellectual
<pb n="609"/>

vigour gives in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> new signs of restraint, but the development of control
may well mark a stage of advance in the flood of inspiration.</p>
<p>The sharp contrast, too, between the subject-matter of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi>
and that of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> points plainly to some intervening space of time in the
composition of the two plays, and suggests that <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is the later of the two.
The simple austerity of Coriolanus' tragic career is the ethical antithesis of the
passionate subtlety of the story of Antony and his mistress. Turbulent as are
the emotional storms which overwhelm Coriolanus, they break in an atmos-
phere of sombre clarity, out of which the voluptuous fire may well have lately
died.</p>
<p>The imagery, which reflects the sterner sentiment, confirms the impression that
the tide of emotional impulse is just on the ebb. The metaphors and similes of
<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> are hardly less <hi rend="italic">abundant</hi> than in <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> and no less vivid.
But, save in the final crisis, they lack the lyric warmth of colour which characterises
the former piece. Their vitality is often due to their unromantic homeliness; they
are at times impressive from an almost prosaic directness. Coriolanus' wounds
are compared to &lsquo;graves i' the holy churchyard&rsquo; (III, iii, 69). He conquers like
the osprey, who takes the fish &lsquo;by sovereignty of nature&rsquo; (IV, vii, 37). There is
no more pity in him than &lsquo;milk in a male tiger&rsquo; (V, iv, 28). Soldiers follow him

<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;with no less confidence</l>
<l>Than boys pursuing summer butterflies</l>
<l>Or butchers killing flies&rsquo;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 4.6.118">(IV, vi, 118-120).</bibl></cit>

In his most impassioned moods the hero develops a noble grandeur of figurative
utterance. But, in spite of its dignity and its magnificent range, it still savours
for the most part of a sculpturesque, albeit colossal, severity. He goes into solitary
banishment &lsquo;like to a lonely dragon&rsquo; (IV, i, 35). His mother on her knees at his
feet is &lsquo;Olympus nodding in supplication to a molehill&rsquo; (V, iii, 34, 35). His emotions,
strained almost to breaking point by Volumnia's appeal, make it difficult for him
to believe the sight of her prostration, and his incredulity carries him involuntarily
beyond the limits of earth to celestial altitudes:

<cit><quote><l>Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach</l>
<l>Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds</l>
<l>Strike the proud cedars &rsquo;gainst the fiery sun&rsquo;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 5.3.64"> (V, iii, 64-66).</bibl></cit>

But such outbursts are rare. In his penultimate utterance he resumes the more
normal and more mundane strain, and meets death with the glorious boast

<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I</l>
<l>Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli;</l>

Lyric digression is outside the scope of the play, and the lyric glow which fires
the emotional speech of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> is exchanged for the chastened heat
of classic sublimity.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>Are there any events to which Shakespeare may be
thought to refer in the course of the play? To this question, as might be expected,
there is no lack of answers. It is no sooner asked than the air is filled with voices.
The play was written about 1608, shout three at once; or at any rate not much
later. This is fair enough. But why? Because, says one, Shakespeare talks of
&lsquo;the coal of fire upon the ice&rsquo; (I, i, 185), and in January, 1608, the Thames was
frozen over. Very well, says another; but you have not observed the still more
curious fact that when Coriolanus lived there was a famine in Rome, and that in
1608-09 there was a famine in England! You have both missed it, says the third;
the true reason is much more pretty and sad: Shakespeare's mother died in Sep-
tember, 1608; that is why he makes Volumnia so prominent. After listening to
these voices it would be undemocratic not to listen to all. There is the 1609
faction to be heard. It has less to say, but it belongs to the same school of thought.
It relies neither on ice nor famine nor autumn. It rests its whole case on mul-
berries. &lsquo;Humble thy head,&rsquo; says Volumnia to her son,

<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;as the ripest mulberry</l>
<l>That will not bear the handling&rsquo;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 3.2"> (III, ii, 98, 99).</bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>Who does not see in this the compliment to King James for his bringing out of
France in the year 1609 so many hundred thousands of young mulberry trees to
feed silkworms? These are strange voices. To refute them is no part of my
design, though they may still be heard echoing in our text-books. They refute
themselves, for they have indeed the very accent of folly.</p>
<p>The critics who look for parallels in political history are on safer ground. There
is a constitutional problem in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> and there was a constitutional problem
in the reign of James. It was certainly a critical time. The struggle of King and
Commons, which broke the Stuarts and changed the Constitution, had begun
before Shakespeare left London. In 1610 one Parliament was dissolved; in 1614
James dissolved another. Was it likely, we are asked, when events of such con-
sequence were being enacted, that Shakespeare would sit still and say nothing?
This is an odd question. I cannot think that it would have been understood in
<pb n="611"/>

Shakespeare's age. The dramatists of that age, however freely they may have
disputed in their taverns and merry meetings about affairs of state, were seldom
tempted to exhibit them on the boards. It is one thing to &lsquo;sit by the fire and pre-
sume to know what's done i' the Capitol&rsquo;; it is quite another thing to put your
presumptions on the stage. The law on the matter was sharp and sudden; and
nothing is better known than that contemporary politics make bad plays. That
Shakespeare shared these feelings in a degree unusual even in that age has never
been doubted. He is the last man we go to if we wish to hear the din of Tudor
and Jacobean controversy. To suppose, therefore, that in a play concerned with
a well-known story of early Rome, fully set forth in an author whom he discreetly
follows, he should have been dependent for his motive on a parliamentary struggle
which was still far from assuming an appearance of national danger, is to distort
the evidence of human nature. No one would deny that in dealing with politics
in his plays Shakespeare must have drawn on his experience of politics in life.
In this matter, as in others, the citizen helped the playwright. But we cannot
proceed on that ground alone to cite particular events as the inspiration of par-
ticular plays. Even the advocates of 1610 and 1614 must confess that there is
nothing in the political situation of Coriolanus which may not come out of Plutarch,
and that it is an odd way of expressing one's mind about James and his parliaments
&mdash;James who shuddered at a sword, and his unwilling assemblies of country gentle-
men&mdash;to select for the one part Coriolanus, and for the other the tribunes and
their mob.</p>
<p>Let us, then, relinquish these hopes, and since other events have failed us, let
us study the play as an event in its author's life. Here is a play written by Shake-
speare, in a certain style of diction, of metre, and of sentiment, one of more than
thirty of which he was the undoubted author. We are asked to tell its age. The
problem is a familiar one. We solve it daily when we tell the age of men by their
looks. For a sincere piece of writing may be as tell-tale as a face, and to a man
who has followed the sincerest of authors (as Shakespeare is) through his twenty
years of incessant writing, a line may be as good as a wrinkle to tell its age by, and
a jest, a speech, a sentiment, the same thing as your three gray hairs on your bald
crown. To such a man Shakespeare's plays pass as definitely through the series
of the ages as he does himself, and are young, not so young, mature, and middle
aged, like his acquaintances in life.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> it is readily seen, is a play of middle life, of the settled years on the
other side of maturity. We feel it in the moral gravity of the piece and its military
march of action, in its senatorial disregard for the niceties of speech and the vanities
of poetry, in its knotty language, its heavy irony, and its sarcastic humour. Of
these signs of age I shall examine only two&mdash;its speech and its verse. They are
equally removed from the style of speech and verse with which readers of Shake-
speare are most familiar, the style of the plays in the ten years between <hi rend="italic">The
Merchant of Venice</hi> (1595-96) and <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> (1606). The difference shows itself
in a very practical way. You could fill an anthology with extracts from these
plays, extracts that could give pleasure by themselves, that could be recited by
themselves, often without regard either to the character who spoke them or to the
situation which gave them birth. There are no such extracts to be made from
<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> no set speeches, no polished declamations, no flights of poetry rising
above the matter and scorning to be relevant. The anthologist must go elsewhere
for his posies and the reciter for his periods, for there is literally nothing in <hi rend="italic">Corio-
lanus</hi> that will bear removal. Every word uttered is rooted in its context, &lsquo;an
<pb n="612"/>

oak, not to be wind-shaken.&rsquo; If you take anything you must take everything.
It is the whole scene or nothing.</p>
<p>The verse of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> has the same character as its speeches, of which it may
be said that though they are as fine as any in Shakespeare, yet no one knows them
apart from the play. No one learns them, no one quotes them. The reason is
that they are most of them business speeches, which begin and end with the
occasion. The verse of the play is equally business-like and self-denying. To
linger in the memory and live in random quotation is no part of its function. Its
function, which it discharges to admiration, is to fit the speech of the actors,
nothing more. The meditative and romantic graces of Shakespeare's earlier verse
are all absent from these scenes, and they are absent for the best of reasons, because
they are not wanted. Fancy, meditation, and romance have no part in the motives
of the play. The current of the verse is like the current of the action, now sullen,
now torrential. It stays to kiss no sedges on its way to the sea. To be poetry, it
might almost be said, is not so much its concern as to be the perfectly expressive
servant of thoughts and deeds. That such verse could only be written late no one
can doubt. None but an old craftsman could so subjugate his verse to the ex-
pression of pure action and idea. <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar,</hi> which was written in 1601, reads
like a young man's work beside it.</p>
<p>We are now within sight of a conclusion. We agreed to think, on external evi-
dence, that the play was written between 1605 and 1610. We are inclined to
think, on the evidence of style and idea, that the date which we seek is the latest
possible between these years. The confirmation desired is furnished by a peculiar-
ity in the verse of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> a peculiarity which it shares with all Shakespeare's
latest plays: I mean the great number of unemphatic monosyllables at the end of
lines. This had long been observed and remarked upon as one of several devices
employed by Shakespeare to assimilate his verse to the rhythm of dramatic con-
versation. Extra syllables, both within and at the end of the lines and trisyllabic
feet, are other devices which might be named; devices designed to the same end,
the loosening of the blank verse line, and used by Shakespeare more frequently the
longer he wrote.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>It has been often, and correctly, observed that Volumnia's
earnest and finally successful address to her son is taken from Plutarch. And
the murder of the Roman general by the Volscians, at the instigation of the jealous
Tullus Aufidius, is equally conformable to the old book.</p>
<p>Such is the use which Shakespeare has made of that which is now called <hi rend="italic">The
Legend of Coriolanus.</hi> Certainly the story must be founded upon legends or
traditions, and these passing over a great number of years; for its date is given
at the 260th or, according to some, the 290th year of Rome, being nearly five
hundred years before the Christian ear. Plutarch flourished in the time of the
Emperor Claudius; nor have we any historian earlier than Livy, who preceded
Plutarch by little more than a century. The story in Livy is not materially
different from Plutarch's, and includes the enmity between Coriolanus and the
commons, the successful embassy of the women, and various other particulars.
<pb n="614"/>
</p>
<p>But the Greek has improved upon the Roman almost as much as the Englishman
has improved upon the Greek; the hero's peculiar devotion to his mother, and all
the nicer traits of his character, are worked out by Plutarch. Of those who pre-
ceded, Dionysius Halicarnessensis comes nearest to him, who describes Coriolanus
as one of the &lsquo;oligarchical patricians,&rsquo; who spoke openly and boldly against the
plebeians and their tribunes.</p>
<p>Plutarch's work is more evidently wrought up for effect; otherwise Livy is
hardly better authority for what passed in the third century of Rome. He is
said to have founded his history, in great part, upon the writings of older authors,
of which extracts have been given; but none of these go farther back than the
sixth century; indeed, if any written annals of the early Roman history existed,
it is not probable that they survived the burning of Rome by the Gauls in the
year of Rome 372. If any less perishable records of brass or stone survived the
conflagration they can be depended upon for nothing beyond a name or a date.</p></quote>

<quote><p>If we consider the minuteness
with which our poet utilized his sources, and keep in mind that he never forbore
from availing himself of the smallest effect that could impart a new and char-
acteristic life to his portrait, we are forced to suppose that, had he perused the
edition in question, he would have made use of some highly interesting touches
in the likeness of Octavius C&aelig;sar, found among the &lsquo;newly added lives&rsquo; of the
edition of 1603. And if these touches be wanting in the picture, otherwise so true
to its original, we are entitled to believe that the painter had no opportunity of
seeing them, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> that he made use of an edition into which this new biography
of Octavius C&aelig;sar was not yet admitted.</p>
<p>So our researches are confined to the two editions of 1579 and 1595, and there
I have found one word that induces me to fix my opinion upon the present ques-
tion. In the edition of 1579, page 237, we read:

<cit><quote>Of the same house were Publius, and Quintus, who brought to ROME their best water they had by conducts.</quote><bibl></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>In the margin:
<cit><quote>Publius and Quintus Martius, brought the water by conducts to Rome.</quote><bibl></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>In the edition of 1595, page 235:
<cit><quote>Of the same house were Publius, and Quintus, who brought to ROME their best water they had by conduites.</quote><bibl></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>In the margin:
<cit><quote>Publius and Quintus Martius, brought the water by conduites to Rome.</quote><bibl></bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>In the I. Folio, <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> Act II, page 14, we read:

<cit><quote><l>Of the same House Publius and Quintus were,</l>
<l>That our best Water, brought by Conduits hither,</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 2.3">shak. cor 2.3.250</bibl></cit>

and so perhaps we have some right, or at least some inducement, to receive the
conformity of the text of 1595 with the I. Folio, concerning the orthography of
the word &lsquo;conduits&rsquo; as a support of some moment for the opinion that the edition
of Plutarch of 1595 has been Shakespeare's source. I will not lay too great a stress
on this perhaps accidental conformity, especially since Shakespeare uses the same
word &lsquo;conduits,&rsquo; even in plays prior to the year 1595; but perhaps I shall be permitted 
<pb n="615"/>

to pronounce this conjecture the best, so long as no better shall have been
advanced.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>It has been justly said that Shakespeare's deviations
from history in his historical plays, Roman and English, are mainly changes of
time and place, and seldom involve misrepresentation of character or fact. I pre-
sume that Shakespeare regarded Plutarch's story of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> as not less historical
than his story of <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra.</hi> Shakespeare's Coriolanus
seems to me essentially, if with some heightened traits, the Coriolanus of Plutarch;
and he reproduced no less closely Plutarch's picture of the son's subjection to the
mother. Plutarch puts this relation in the foreground. He tells us at the outset
that Coriolanus's deeds were done for Volumnia's sake alone, and &lsquo;at her desire
he took a wife also, and yet never left his mother's house therefore.&rsquo; From this
presentment of Volumnia's fatal sway and from her great speech Shakespeare
built up his characterisation of Volumnia, adding the one point which distinguishes
her, not to her advantage, from her son. The admirable scene in which Volumnia
urges Coriolanus to dissimulate has no parallel in Plutarch's Life.</p>
<p>The Aufidius-element in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is an expansion of Plutarch's account. We
see in Shakespeare's Aufidius the struggle between a certain generosity of nature,
which compels him, as a soldier, to admire Coriolanus' soldierly grandeur, and the
gradual ascendancy of his personal bitterness. This struggle is outlined by
Plutarch. He speaks of Aufidius first as &lsquo;a man of a great mind,&rsquo; and then shows
how this greatness of mind succumbed to that last infirmity&mdash;jealousy. &lsquo;Though
he had received no private injury or displeasure of Martius, yet the common fault
and imperfection of man's nature wrought in him, and it grieved him to see his
own reputation blemished through Martius' great fame and honour.&rsquo; Observe
how early in the tragedy the Aufidius-element is brought in.</p>
<p>Virgilia and Menenius are practically new characters. In Plutarch Virgilia is
a <foreign lang="la">muta persona,</foreign> referred to on two or three occasions, once by name. The fact
that in Plutarch's narrative she is so overshadowed by Volumnia gave Shakespeare
his cue. Also, insight would tell him what type of woman were most likely to
be chosen for wife by a mighty warrior. Somehow Virgilia and Coriolanus turn
our thoughts to Desdemona and Othello.</p>
<p>Menenius illustrates more than any other character in Shakespeare that occurs
to me how a seed of suggestion will fructify in Shakespeare's imagination. All
that Plutarch says about Menenius is that he was &lsquo;chief man&rsquo; of the embassy
of &lsquo;the pleasantest old men and the most acceptable to the people&rsquo; who were sent
by the Senate to remonstrate with them after their secession to the Mons Sacer
outside Rome; that he used successfully &lsquo;many good persuasions and gentle requests
to the people&rsquo;; and ended with his &lsquo;notable tale&rsquo; of the belly and the other members
of the body.</p>
<p>Of Valeria we may just note that in Plutarch it is she, not Volumnia, who pro-
poses the embassy of the Roman ladies to plead with Coriolanus. Shakespeare
does not expressly say that the idea originated with Volumnia, but he certainly
creates that impression in our minds. The dramatic scheme required that the
credit should be transferred to Volumnia; subordinate characters must not detract
from the importance of the protagonists.</p>
<p>In the construction of the tragedy the great thing is the concentration of the
interest on Coriolanus himself. The historical material furnished by Plutarch
appeals to Shakespeare only in so far as it shows up the character of Coriolanus
<pb n="616"/>

and the causes of his downfall. Everything is subordinated to this purpose,
everything alien to it eliminated. This method runs throughout his dramatisa-
tions of history. What fascinates Shakespeare is history as the revelation of
individual character: of personal strength, as in <hi rend="italic">Henry V.;</hi> of personal weakness, as
in <hi rend="italic">Richard II.</hi></p>
<p>Some of Shakespeare's omissions are interesting. Thus, Plutarch says that
directly after Coriolanus's banishment, when &lsquo;Rome was in marvellous uproar
and discord&rsquo; between nobles and people, the Senate was further troubled by reports
of &lsquo;sights and wonders.&rsquo; Perhaps the reason why Shakespeare does not allude to
these omens, though he could easily have done so in IV, vi. or V, i, was that he had
worked this motive so thoroughly in the first two acts of <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar.</hi> The relation
of plays which have some community of source or subject is always interesting.</p>
<p>Plutarch mentions that when Coriolanus first invaded the Roman territory &lsquo;he
was very careful to keep the noblemen's lands and goods safe from harm and
burning, but spoiled all the whole country besides,&rsquo; and that he acted thus &lsquo;to
increase still the malice and dissension between the nobility and the commonalty.&rsquo;
The Coriolanus of the tragedy rages against Rome with a resentment that disdains
such devices, and he curses not least the pusillanimous betrayers among his own
class.</p>
<p>Of actual additions to the story the most notable are the scenes of &lsquo;relief,&rsquo;
viz., the domestic interlude, the unconscious absurdities of the servants of Aufidius's
house, and the humour (culminating in pathos) of Menenius's self-assurance with
the sentinels. The whole representation, too, of the Roman people imparts an
element of humour edged with raillery. And Shakespeare may claim for his own
the handling of the child-motive, so wonderfully effective, especially where the
boy's high paternal spirit serves to break the tension. Plutarch mentions several
times Coriolanus's &lsquo;young children&rsquo; (two); for dramatic purposes the half was
certainly better than the whole.</p>
<p>Finally, even where Shakespeare draws largely upon <bibl>North's <title>Plutarch,</title></bibl> he lends
his own heightening touches that spell &lsquo;Shakespeare,&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">e. g.,</hi>

<cit><quote><l part="F">&lsquo;Come, let us go:</l>
<l>This fellow had a Volscian to his mother.&rsquo;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 5.3">shak. cor 5.3.178</bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>What a contrast too between Menenius's &lsquo;tale&rsquo; as told by Plutarch and as
worked up into a vivid and closer parallel by means of dialogue and interruptions
and picturesque expansion, such as the First Citizen's enumeration of the &lsquo;dis-
contented members.&rsquo;</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>North was a master of English. In many places
Shakespeare found his language too good to be improved. No man could open
a narrative better than North. &lsquo;It was even twilight when he entered the city of
Antium, and many people met him in the streets, but no man knew him&rsquo; (p. 154).
This has the unmistakable mark of all great openings; there is the hush of listeners
in it. You may hear it again, among the moderns, in the opening of Stevenson's
<hi rend="italic">Pavilion on the Links:</hi> &lsquo;I was a great solitary when I was young.&rsquo; North is more
vigorous and vernacular than Amyot, as befits the genius of our tongue. His
epithets are more picturesque and his sentences more concrete. Everything must
be definite in North. An ordinary writer would have been content to say of
Coriolanus at Antium that &lsquo;no man could ever have known him, seeing him in
that apparel.&rsquo; What North says is this: &lsquo;no man could ever have known him for
<pb n="617"/>

the person he was, seeing him in that apparel he had upon his back.&rsquo; Even fact
must bend to his passion for reality. Plutarch and Amyot speak of Coriolanus's
&lsquo;children.&rsquo; North, impatient of so indefinite a plural, made the children &lsquo;two.&rsquo;
He is the same in words. He will have nothing technical or colourless in his
vocabulary. Rather than use a dull name he will describe the thing. Plutarch
speaks somewhere in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Coriolanus</hi> of &lsquo;gladiatorial shows.&rsquo; Amyot, height-
ening a little, makes it &lsquo;fencers to the death&rsquo; (escrimeurs &agrave; oultrance). North
makes a picture of it: &lsquo;the cruel fight of fencers at unrebated swords.&rsquo; He is never
the mere servant of his original. He takes sides. When his blood is up he has
his fling. Amyot, speaking of the priests who went on embassy to Coriolanus,
calls them simply &lsquo;men of religion&rsquo; (ces gens de religion). To North, seeing them
in his mind's eye and scorning them, they are &lsquo;this goodly rabble of superstition
and priests&rsquo;; a hendiadys which would scarcely have approved itself to Bishop
Amyot. His imagination seldom sleeps. He is on his feet at every turn of the
drama to assist the speakers. Finding in Amyot the sentence, &lsquo;for necessity de-
mands that your wife and children should be deprived of one of the two, either of
you or of their country&rsquo; (pour ce qu'il est force &agrave; ta femme &amp; &agrave; tes enfans qu'ilz
soient privez de l'un des deux, ou de toy, ou de leur pais), he must needs turn it
into such great-hearted rhetoric as this: &lsquo;for the bitter sop of most hard choice is
offered thy wife and children, to forgo the one of the two: either to lose the person
of thy self, or the nurse of their native country.&rsquo; One of the most vivid phrases
in the whole Life is wholly his. It is a wonder that Shakespeare did not use it.
It is in that part of the narrative where Coriolanus invades the Antiates and
brings back &lsquo;all his men that went out with him safe and sound to Rome, and
every man rich and loaden with spoil.&rsquo; Then, says North, &lsquo;the home-tarriers and
house-doves that kept Rome still, began to repent them that it was not their
hap to go with him.&rsquo; Of &lsquo;home-tarriers&rsquo; and &lsquo;house-doves&rsquo; there is not a sug-
gestion in either Plutarch or Amyot. They are the contribution of that Thomas
North who captained a volunteer band of three hundred men from the Isle of Ely
in the days of the Great Armada. North, indeed, treated Amyot as Amyot had
treated Plutarch. They had a common desire to make Plutarch a national pos-
session. Both were successful. North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> is as certainly English as Amyot's
is French. This was the old theory of translation, and a noble one. Translation
in this view became a form of patriotism comparable to the opening of new trade-
routes and the annexing of islands in the name of the Virgin Queen. To enrich
one's country with the best that the Ancients had thought and done seemed a
mission worthy of a lifetime. Plutarch, so treated, lost his Gr&aelig;co-Roman look,
and became in the sixteenth century what he had been in his own, a citizen of
the world. It is to this result that we owe the plays of Shakespeare, for this was
the only Plutarch whom Shakespeare would have cared to read.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>The first impression produced by a comparison of the
biography and the play is that the latter is little more than a scenic replica of the
former. Shakespeare has indeed absorbed so many suggestions from the transla-
tion that it is difficult to realise how much he has modified them, or to avoid
reading these modifications into his authority when we try to distinguish what
he has received from what he has supplied. And the illusion is confirmed by the
frequency with which we light on familiar words, familiar traits, familiar incidents.
For the similarity seems at first to pervade the language, the characterisation, and
the action.
<pb n="618"/>
</p>
<p>It is unfair to quote the parallel passages without the context, for, apart from
the subtle transmutation they have undergone, they are preludes to original
utterance, and almost every one of them is a starting point rather than the goal.
Shakespeare's normal practice is illustrated in the fable of Menenius, in which,
with every allowance made for possible assistance from Camden, the words of his
authority or authorities are only so many spur-pricks that set his own imagination
at a gallop. And what goes before and comes after is pure Shakespeare.</p>
<p>And it should be noticed that his textual appropriations from North, long or
short, obvious or covert, never clash with his more personal contributions, which
in bulk are far more important. They are all subdued to the tone that the pur-
pose of the dramatist imposes. Delius says with absolute truth: &lsquo;This harmonious
colouring would make it impossible for us, in respect of style, to discover real or
supposititious loans from Plutarch in Shakespeare's drama, and definitely identify
them as such, if by chance North's translation were inaccessible.&rsquo; Yet this har-
monious colouring, that has its source in the author's mind and that is required
by the theme, does not prevent an individualisation in the utterance, whether
wholly original or partly borrowed, that fits it for the lips of the particular speaker.
The language, even when it is suggested by North, is not only spontaneous and
consistent, it is dramatic as well, and apposite to the strongly marked characters
of whom the story is told.</p>
<p>To these characters, and their development by Shakespeare, we now turn. It
may be remarked that all of them, except the quite episodical Adrian and Nicanor,
are nominally to be found in Plutarch, by whom the hero himself is drawn at full
length and in great detail. For his delineation then there was a great deal to
borrow, and Shakespeare has borrowed a great deal. In his general bearing and
in many of his features the Coriolanus of the play is the Coriolanus of the Life,
though, of course, imagined with far more firmness and comprehension. Only on
very close scrutiny do we see that each has a physiognomy of his own, and that the
difference in the impressions they produce is due, not merely to the execution, but
to the conception. This will become clear as the general discussion proceeds and
will incidentally occupy our attention from time to time. Meanwhile it should
be noticed that, Coriolanus excepted, Plutarch's persons are very shadowy and
vague. If we compare this biography with those that Shakespeare had used for
his earlier Roman plays, it is obvious that it is much more of a monograph. In the
others room is found for sketches of many subordinate figures in connection with
the titular subject, but Marcius stands out alone and the remaining personages
are scarcely more than names. In the tragedy, too, he is in possession of the scene,
but his relatives, his friends, and his enemies are also full of interest and life; and
for their portraiture Shakespeare had to depend almost entirely on himself.</p>
<p>Next to the hero, for example, it is his mother who is most conspicuous in the
play; and how much did Plutarch contribute to the conception of her concrete
personality? He supplies only one or two hints, some of which Shakespeare dis-
regards or contradicts. They both attribute to her the sole training of the boy,
but Plutarch implies that her discipline was slack and her instruction insufficient,
while in Shakespeare she incurs no such blame except in so far as we infer a certain
lack of judiciousness from her peculiar attitude to her grandson and from her son's
exaggeration of some of her own traits. But injudiciousness is not quite the same
as the laxity that Plutarch's apologetic paragraph would insinuate.</p>
<p>In the play it is not with tears of joy that Volumnia welcomes her warrior
home.
<pb n="619"/>
</p>
<p>In Shakespeare there is no word of Marcius's marrying at his mother's desire,
and though she apparently lives with him, it is in his, not in her house.</p>
<p>All these notices occur in the first pages of the Life. Thenceforward till her
intervention at the close there is only a passing mention of her affliction at her son's
banishment.</p>
<p>Even in regard to the intercession, where Shakespeare follows Plutarch most
closely, he makes one significant omission. In the original it is the suggestion
of Valeria, &lsquo;through the inspiration of some god above,&rsquo; that the women should
sue for peace, and she visits Marcius's kinswomen to secure their help; by the
suppression of this circumstance the prominent place is left to Volumnia. And
in the appeal itself Shakespeare, besides the various vivifying and personal touches,
makes one important addition. In Plutarch her words are throughout forcible
and impassioned, but they do not burst into the wrathful indignation of the close,
which alone is sufficient to break down Coriolanus' resolution.</p>
<p>Now it is clear that the presence of Volumnia does not pervade the Life as it
does the play, and she has not nearly so much to do. Moreover, besides being less
important, she is less masculine and masterful. Indeed, from Plutarch's hints it
would be possible to construct for her a character that differed widely from that
of Shakespeare's heroine. She is like the latter in her patriotism, her love for the
delight in her son, and, at the critical moment, in her influence over him. But
even her influence is less constant, and seems to be stronger in the way of uncon-
scious inspiration than of positive direction. It would be quite legitimate to
picture her as an essentially womanly woman, high-souled and dutiful, but finding
her chosen sphere in the home, overflowing with sympathy and affection, and
failing in her obligations as widowed mother only by a lack of sternness.</p>
<p>And if Shakespeare has given features to Volumnia, much more has he done so
to Virgilia and young Marcius. Both, of course, are presented in the merest
outline, but in Plutarch the wife is only once named and the children are not
named at all. Shakespeare's Virgilia, on the other hand, by the few words she
speaks and the few words spoken to her, by her very restraint from speech and the
atmosphere in which she moves, produces a very definite as well as a very pleasing
impression. Ruskin, after enumerating some other of Shakespeare's female
characters, concludes that they &lsquo;and last and perhaps loveliest, Virgilia, are all
faultless; conceived in the highest heroic type of humanity.&rsquo; This enthusiasm
may be, as Ruskin's enthusiasms sometimes were, exaggerated and misplaced, but
it could not be roused by a non-entity; and a non-entity Plutarch's Virgilia is.</p>
<p>Young Marcius, again, is not merely one of the two children mentioned in the
Life. As Mr Verity remarks, in this case &lsquo;the half is certainly better than the
whole&rsquo;; and the named half has a wholeness of his own that an anonymous brace
can lay no claim to. He is a thorough boy, and an attractive though boisterous
one. If he is cruel to winged things, he is brave and circumspect withal. He has
a natural objection to be trodden on even for a patriotic cause; if the risk is too
great, &lsquo;he'll run away till he's bigger, but then he'll fight.&rsquo;</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>The relationship between the tragedy
and the life of Caius Martius Coriolanus in North's <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> is remarkably close.
On a casual comparison one might be tempted to assert that Shakespeare merely
translates his material from the biographical to the dramatic form. He adds
scarcely a stroke to the richly detailed characterization of the hero, and he is
anticipated in the names and at least a hint of the nature of virtually all the other
<pb n="620"/>
actors. The main incidents&mdash;the struggle between the classes, the siege of Corioli
and the disposition of the battle, the candidacy for the consulship, the banishment,
the union with Tullus Aufidius, the siege of Rome, the embassy of friends and
family, the compromise, the conspiracy of the Volscians&mdash;all these are to be found
in the original. Furthermore, the essence of the tragedy for Plutarch no less than
for Shakespeare is moral rather than political; the strife of patricians and populace
is but as the sound of drums and cymbals accompanying the conflict in the spirit
of the protagonist. Finally, Shakespeare takes over from North's translation
many passages almost word for word, including parts of some of the finest speeches.
It is not more than justice to say that he must share his triumph with two brilliant
coadjutors, North and Plutarch.</p>
<p>Yet there is a great gulf between biographical narration and dramatic action.
Examined more narrowly, Coriolanus reveals everywhere as compared with
Plutarch&mdash;in suppression as well as in addition, in compression, emphasis, and
intensification&mdash;a more exigent mind controlling a far more difficult art, a genius
of higher pitch evoking a far more complex harmony.</p>
<p>Thus at the beginning of the play Shakespeare condenses the three popular
uprisings recorded by Plutarch into one, because that suffices for his purpose.
In Plutarch the banishment of Coriolanus follows some time after his failure to
secure the consulship and in consequence of his opposition to a free distribution
of corn. Shakespeare makes the banishment fall on his hero at the pinnacle of
glory, hot on the heels of his candidacy. The omens and supernatural visions
following the exile and made prominent by Plutarch, Shakespeare suppresses in
the interest of the sternly realistic mood in which he has conceived the drama.
He makes no use of &lsquo;Martius Coriolanus's crafty accusation of the Volscians,&rsquo;
perhaps thinking it inconsistent with the fiery frankness of his hero. He trans-
fers the scene of the Volscian conspiracy from Antium to Corioli in the interest
of tragic irony. His are the speeches of citizens and officers interpreting the mind
of the people; the dialogue of servants in the house of Aufidius; the household
scene between Volumnia, Virgilia, and Valeria; the effective scene in which Corio-
lanus reveals his poignant physical repugnance to exhibiting his scars to the
people; the scene in which Coriolanus's family and friends entreat him to tempor-
ize and assume humility; the scene in which Menenius is rebuffed. Most impor-
tant of all is his development of the minor characters. Menenius, save for a hint
two or three lines long, is his own creation. He replaces the vague &lsquo;children&rsquo;
of Plutarch by the delightful sketch of the young Marcius. He subdues Valeria,
who is the real heroine of the original, and brings Volumnia into the foreground,
transforming her from a tearful suppliant into a matron of heroic mould and
temper&mdash;such a woman as Cato would have a Roman mother. He disposes all
the persons of the play in such a way that like so many mirrors they reflect the
countenance of the hero and flash their light back upon his face.</p>
<p>The more closely these alterations are studied&mdash;the list is by no means exhaustive
&mdash;the more indispensable they appear, and the more clearly it becomes evident that
Shakespeare did not, as some of the elder commentators declared, take Plutarch
over bodily and exactly, but, highly as he prized his material, transformed it to his
own uses, dealt with it freely, imaginatively, creatively in his own imperial way.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> A comparison of the many passages in
the lives of Antonius and of Coriolanus with the corresponding lines in Shakespeare
shows that the dramatist was satisfied in no small number of cases to incorporate
<pb n="621"/>

whole speeches from North with the least change consistent with the production
of blank verse. The description of Cleopatra's first visit to Antony, the dying
speech of Antony, and the few noble lines that glorify the passing of Cleopatra,
the address of Coriolanus to Tullus Aufidius when he throws himself upon the
latter's hospitality, and the last all-decisive speech of Volumnia to her son&mdash;these
passages, all of which rank among the special treasures of Shakespearean poetry,
come straight and essentially unaltered out of North.</p>
<p>Nowhere else in Shakespeare is there an instance of verbal borrowing at the
height of dramatic intensity which is comparable to these. Even the speech of
Portia to Brutus in <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi> offers no parallel, for there we can see plainly
the deliberate poetic handling which North's words suffered, fine though they are,
before they were allowed a place in the drama. In the passages I have cited
there is little evidence of any attempt at improvement; indeed, it may be held
in regard to several of them that the palm belongs rather to North's prose than to
Shakespeare's poetry. That this should be so is a fact worthy of all wonder and
attention, for the like can be said of no other of Shakespeare's rivals or assistants.</p>
<p>Yet it is easy to misinterpret woefully the meaning of phenomenon. The
criticism that blatantly advertises North as the writer who has surpassed Shake-
speare in his own art is illogical as well as foolish. It rests on a wrong conception
of the nature of Shakespeare's latest work. The probable date of <hi rend="italic">Antony and
Cleopatra</hi> is 1607, and <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is somewhat later. During this his last period
the poet's manner is characterized; it is not, however, marked by minute attention
to details. In structure as in versification we find a certain looseness; the care-
lessness of conscious mastery overrides trifling rules before which immaturity
had bent. After all, North's style, as we see it in these four Lives, is pretty much
of a piece, and what Shakespeare had been able to improve on in 1601, when he
wrote <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar,</hi> was assuredly not beyond him in 1607. The truth is that
Shakespeare's interest in the last two Roman plays is centred nearly exclusively
in character, in Antony and Cleopatra, Volumnia, and Coriolanus. He has earned
the right to ignore rules of syntax and of scansion. He may at this time appro-
priate without scruple whatever North has written that will serve his purpose
and would cost him pains to write better. It is no more than the assertion of
genius's privilege of indifference to non-essentials&mdash;the natural corollary of the
&lsquo;infinite capacity for taking pains,&rsquo; where the pains are worth the taking.</p>
<p>The borrowing is a deservedly high compliment to North; it is far from being a
reproach to Shakespeare. It is as Archibshop Trench has said in his lectures on
Plutarch: &lsquo;Shakespeare does not abdicate his royal pre-eminence, but resumes it
at any moment that he pleases.&rsquo; To take the dying speech of Charmion and fit
it indistinguishably into a setting worthy of it, to borrow nearly unchanged the
words of Coriolanus to Aufidius, and then to give them their needed consummation
in the answer of Aufidius&mdash;this surely is a greater achievement than to have new-
written the two scenes.</p></quote></cit>

<p>The house of the Martians at Rome was of the number of the Patricians, out

one, king <hi rend="italic">Numaes</hi> daughters sonne, who was king of Rome after <hi rend="italic">Tullus Hos-</hi>
<pb n="622"/>

<hi rend="italic">tilius.</hi> Of the same house were <hi rend="italic">Publius, &amp; Quintus,</hi> who brought to Rome their
best water they had by conduites. <hi rend="italic">Censorinus</hi> also came of that
<note anchored="yes" place="left">II, iii,
253-262.</note>
familie, that was so surnamed, because the people had chosen him Cen-
sor twise. Through whose persuasion they made a lawe, that no man
from thenceforth might require, or enjoy the Censorshippe twise. <hi rend="italic">Caius Martius,</hi>
whose life we intend now to write, being left an orphan by his father, was brought
up under his mother a widowe, who taught us by experience, that orphanage
bringeth many discommodities to a childe, but doth not hinder him to become
an honest man, and to excell in vertue above the common sorte: as they that
are meanely borne, wrongfully doe complaine, that it is the occasion of their
casting awaye, for that no man in their youth taketh any care of them to see them
well brought up, and taught that were meete. This man also is a good proofe to
confirme some mens opinions. That a rare and excellent witte untaught, doth
bring forth many good and evill things together: like a fat soile bringeth forth
herbes &amp; weedes that lieth unmanured. For this <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> naturall wit and great
hart did marvellously sturre up his courage to doe and attempt notable actes.
But on the other side for lacke of education, he was so chollericke and impacient,
that he would yeeld to no living creature: which made him churlishe, uncivil, and
altogether unfit for any mans conversation. Yet men marvelling much at his
constancie, that he was never overcome with pleasure, nor money, and how he
would endure easilie all manner of paines and travailles: thereupon they well
liked and commended his stowtnes and temperancie. But for all that, they could
not be acquainted with him, as one citizen useth to be with another in the cittie.
His behaviour was so unpleasant to them by reason of a certaine insolent and
sterne manner he had, which because it was too lordly, was disliked. And to say
truly, the greatest benefite that learning bringeth men unto, is this: that it teacheth
men that be rude and rough of nature, by compasse and rule of reason, to be civill
and curteous, &amp; to like better the meane state, then the higher. Now in those
dayes, valiantnes was honoured in Rome above all other vertues:
which they call virtus, by the name of vertue it selfe, as including
<note anchored="yes" place="left">II, ii, 95-97.</note>
in that generall name, all other speciall vertues besides. So that
virtus in the Latin, was as much as valiantnesse. But <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> being more inclined
to the warres, then any other gentleman of his time: beganne from his childehood
to give himselfe to handle weapons, and dayly did excercise himselfe therein.
And outward he esteemed armour to no purpose, unles one were naturally armed
within. Morover he did so excercise his bodie to hardnes and all kind of activitie,
that he was very swift in running, strong in wrestling, &amp; mightie in griping, so
that no man could ever cast him. Insomuch as those that would trie masteries
with him for strength and nimblenes, would saye when they were overcome: that
al was by reason of his natural strength, and hardnes of warde, that never yeelded
to any paine or toyle he tooke upon him. The first time he went to the warres,
being but a stripling, was when <hi rend="italic">Tarquine</hi> surnamed the prowde (that
had bene king of Rome, and was driven out for his pride, after many
<note anchored="yes" place="left">II, ii, 100.</note>
attemptes made by sundry battelles to come in againe, wherein he
was ever overcome) did come to Rome, with all the ayde of the Latines, &amp; many
other people of Italie: even as it were to set up his whole rest upon a battell by
them, who with a great &amp; mightie armie had undertaken to put him into his king-
dome againe, not so much to pleasure him, as to overthrow the power of the
Romaines, whose greatness they both feared and envied. In this battell, wherein
were many hotte and sharpe encounters of either partie, <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> valliantly fought
<pb n="623"/>

in the sight of the Dictator: &amp; a Romaine souldier being thrown to the ground
even hard by him, <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> straight bestrid him, and slew the enemie
<note anchored="yes" place="left">II, ii,
104-110.</note>
with his owne handes that had before overthrown the Romaine.
Hereupon, after the battell was wonne, the Dictator did not forget
so noble an acte, and therefore first of all he crowned <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> with a garland of
oken boughs. For whosoever saueth the life of a Romaine, it is a maner among
them, to honour him with such a garland. This was, either because the lawe
did this honour to the oke, in favour of the Arcadians, who by the oracle of <hi rend="italic">Apollo</hi>
were in olde time called eaters of akornes: or else because the souldiers might easily
in every place come by oken boughes: or lastly, because they thought it very
necessarie, to give him that had saved a cittizens life, a crowne of this tree to
honour him, being properly dedicated unto <hi rend="italic">Jupiter,</hi> the patron and protectour
of their citties, and thought amongst other wilde trees to bring forth a profitable
frute, and of plantes to be the strongest. . . . Moreover, it is daily seene, that
honour and reputation lighting on yong men before their time, and before they
have no great courage by nature: the desire to winne more, dieth straight in
them, which easily happeneth, the same having no deepe roote in them before.
Where contrarie wise, the first honour that valliant mindes do come unto, doth
quicken up their appetite, hasting them forward as with force of winde, to enter-
prise thinges of high deserving praise. For they esteeme not, to receive reward
for service done, but rather take it for a remembrance and encouragement, to
make them doe better in time to come: and be ashamed also to cast their honour
at their heeles, not seeking to increase it still by like desert of worthie valiant
deedes. This desire being bred in <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> he strained still to passe himselfe in
manlines: and being desirous to shew a daylie increase of his valiantnesse, his
noble service did still advance his fame, bringing in spoyles upon spoyles from
the enemie. Whereupon, the captaines that came afterwards (for envie of them
that went before) did contend who should most honour him, and who should
beare most honorable testimonie of his valiantnes. Insomuch the Romaines
having many warres and battells in those dayes, <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> was at them all: and
there was not a battell fought, from whence he returned not without some reward
of honour. And as for other, the only respect that made them valiant, was they
hoped to have honour: but touching <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> the onely thing that made him to
love honour, was the joy he sawe his mother did take of him. For
he thought nothing made him so happie and honorable, as that his
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, i, 40-42.</note>
mother might heare everie body praise and commend him, that shee
might alwayes see him returne with a crowne upon his head, and that she might
still imbrace him with teares running downe her cheekes for joye. . . . But
<hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> thinking all due to his mother, that had bene also due to his father if
he had lived: did not only content himselfe to rejoyce and honour her, but at
her desire took a wife also, by whome he had two children, and yet never left his
mothers house therefore. Now he being growen to great credit &amp; authoritie in
Rome for his valiantnes, it fortuned there grewe sedition in the
cittie, because the Senate did favour the rich against the people,
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, i, 83-88.</note>
who did complaine of the sore oppression of usurers, of whom they
borrowed money. For those that had litle, were yet spoyled of that litle they
had by their creditours, for lacke of abilitie to paye the usurie: who offered their
goodes to be solde to them that would give most. And such as had nothing left,
their bodies were layed hold on, and they were made their bondmen, notwith-
standing all the woundes and cuttes they shewed, which they had received in
<pb n="624"/>

many battells, fighting for defence of their countrie and common wealth: of the
which, the last warre they made was against the Sabines, wherein they fought
upon the promise the rich men had made them, that from thenceforth they would
intreate them more gently and also upon the word of <hi rend="italic">Marcus Valerius</hi> chiefe of
the Senate, who by authoritie of the Counsell, &amp; in the behalfe of the rich, sayed
they should performe that they had promised. But after that they had faith-
fully served in this last battell of all, where they overcame their enemies, seeing
they were never a whit the better, nor more gently intreated, and that the Senate
would give no care to them, but made as though they had forgotten their former
promise, and suffered them to be made slaves and bondemen to their creditors,
and besides, to be turned out of all that ever they had: they fell
then even to flat rebellion and mutinie, and to sturre up daungerous
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, i, 3.</note>
tumults within the cittie. The Romaines enemies hearing of this
rebellion did straight enter the territories of Rome with a marvellous great power,
spoyling and burning all as they came. Whereupon the Senate immediatly made
open proclamation by sound of trumpet, that all those that were of lawfull age
to carie weapon, should come and enter their names into the muster masters
booke, to goe to the warres: but no man obeied their commaundement. Where-
upon their chiefe magistrates, and many of the Senate, began to be of divers opinions
among themselves. For some thought it was reason, they should somewhat
yeelde to the poore peoples request, and that they should a little qualifie the severitie
of the lawe. Other held hard against that opinion, and that was <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> for one.
For he alleged, that the creditours losing their money they had lent, was not the
worst thing that was thereby: but that the lenitie that was favored, was a begin-
ning of disobedience, and that the proude attempt of the communaltie, was to
abolish law, and to bring all to confusion. Therefore he sayed, if the Senate
were wise, they should betimes prevent and quench this ill favored &amp; worse ment
beginning. The Senate met many dayes in consultation about it: but in the
end they concluded nothing. The poore common people seeing no redresse,
gathered themselves one day together, and one encoraging another,
they all forsooke the cittie, and encamped themselves upon a hill,
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, i, 60-63.</note>
called at that daye the holy hill, alongest the river of Tyber, offring
no creature any hurt or violence, or making any shewe of actual rebellion: saving
that they cried as they went up and downe, that the rich men had driven them out
of the cittie, and that all Italie through they should find aire, water, and ground
to burie them in. Moreover, they sayed, to dwell at Rome was nothing else
but to be slaine, or hurt with continuall warres, and fighting for defence of the
rich mens goodes. The Senate being afeard of their departure, did send unto
them certaine of the pleasantest olde men, and the most acceptable
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, i, 53.</note>

after many good persuasions and gentle requestes made to the

tale, in this manner. That on a time all the members of mans body did rebell
against the bellie, complaining of it, that it onely remained in the middest of
the bodie, without doing anything, neither did beare any labour to the mainte-
naunce of the rest: whereas all other partes and members did labour paynefully,
&amp; were very carefull to satisffie the appetites and desires of the bodie. And so
the bellie, all this notwithstanding laughed at their follie, and sayed. It is true, I

to the norishment of other partes of the same. Even so (quoth he) &ocirc; you, my
maisters, and citizens of Rome: the reason is alike betweene the Sen-
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, i, 110.</note>
ate &amp; you. For matters being wel digested, their counsells throughly
examined, touching the benefite of the common wealth: the Sena-
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, i,
158-163.</note>
tours are cause of the common comoditie that cometh unto every
one of you. These persuasions pacified the people, condition-
ally, that the Senate would graunt there should be yerely chosen five magis-
trates, which they now call <hi rend="italic">Tribuni plebis,</hi> whose office should be to
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, i,
230-232.</note>
defend the poore people from violence and oppression. So <hi rend="italic">Junius</hi>
<hi rend="italic">Brutus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sicinius Vellutus,</hi> were the first Tribunes of the people
that were chosen, who had onely bene the causers &amp; procurers of this sedition.
Hereupon the citie being grown againe to good quiet and unitie, the people imme-
diately went to the warres, shewing that they had a good will to do better than
ever they did, and to be very willing to obey the magistrates in that they would
commaund, concerning the warres. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> also, though it liked him nothing to
see the greatnes of the people thus increased, considering, it was to the prejudice,
and imbasing of the nobilitie, and also sawe that other noble Patricians were
troubled as well as himselfe: he did persuade the Patricians, to shew themselves
no lesse forward and willing to fight for their countrie, then the common people
were: and to let them know by their deedes and actes, that they did not so much
passe the people in power and riches, as they did exceede them in true nobilitie
and valiantnesse. In the countrie of the Volsces against whom the Romaines
made war at that time, there was a principall cittie &amp; of most fame, that was
called Corioles, before the which the Consul <hi rend="italic">Cominius</hi> did laye siege.
Wherefore al the other Volsces fearing least that cittie should be
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, iv.</note>
taken by assault, they came from all partes of the countrie to save it,
entending to give the Romaines battell before the cittie, and to give an onset on
them in two severall places. The Consul <hi rend="italic">Cominius</hi> understanding this, devided
his armie also into two partes, and taking the one part with himself, he marched
towards them that were drawing to the cittie, out of the countrie: and the other
part of the armie he left in the campe with <hi rend="italic">Titus Latius</hi> (one of the valiantest men
the Romaines had at that time) to resist those that would make any saly out of
the cittie upon them. So the <hi rend="italic">Coriolans</hi> making small accompt of them that
laye in campe before the cittie, made a salye out upon them, in the
which at the first the <hi rend="italic">Coriolans</hi> had the better, and drave the
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, iv, 38-45.</note>
Romaines backe againe into the trenches of their campe. But
<hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> being there at that time, running out of the campe with a fewe men with
him, he slew the first enemies he met withal, and made the rest of them stay upon
the sodain, crying out to the Romaines that had turned their backes, and calling
them againe to fight with a loud voyce. For he was even such another, as Cato
would have a souldier and a captaine to be, not only terrible, and
fierce to lay about him, but to make the enemie afearde with the
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, iv, 82.</note>
sounde of his voyce, and grimnes of his countenance. Then there
flocked about him immediately, a great number of Romaines: whereat the enemies
were so afeard, that they gave backe presently. But <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> not staying so, did
chase and followe them to their owne gates, that fled for life. And
there perceiving that the Romaines retired backe, for the great number
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, iv, 61-65.</note>
of dartes and arrowes which flew about their eares from the walles of
the cittie, &amp; that there was not one man amongest them that durst venter him-
selfe to follow the flying enemies into the cittie, for that it was full of men of warre,
<pb n="626"/>

very well armed, and appointed: he did encorage his fellowes with wordes and
deedes, crying out to them, that fortune had opened the gates of the cittie, more
for the followers then the flyers. But all this notwithstanding, few had the hartes
to follow him. Howbeit <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> being in the throng among the enemies, thrust
himselfe into the gates of the cittie; and entred the same among them that fled,
without that any one of them durst at the first turne their face upon him, or else
offer to stay him. But he looking about him, &amp; seeing he was entred the cittie
with very fewe men to helpe him, and perceiving he was environed by his enemies
that gathered round about to set upon him: did thinges as it is written, wonderfull
and incredible, as well for the force of his hand, as also for the agilitie of his body
and with a wonderfull corage and valiantnes, he made a lane through the middest
of them, and overthrew also those he layed at: that some he made runne to the
furthest part of the cittie and other for feare he made yeeld themselves, and to let
fall their weapons before him. By this means, <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> that was gotten out, had
some leisure to bring the Romaines with more safetie into the cittie. The cittie
being taken in this sorte, the most part of the souldiers beganne incontinently to
spoile, to carry away, and to looke up the bootie they had wonne.
But <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> was marvellous angry with them, and cryed out of them,
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, v, 1-17.</note>
that it was no time now to looke after spoyle, and to runne stragling
heere and there to enrich themselves, whilest the other Consul and their fellowe
cittizens peradventure were fighting with their enemies: and how that leaving the
spoyle, they should seeke to winde themselves out of danger and perill. Howbeit
crie, and saye, to them what he could, very fewe of them would harken to him.
Wherefore taking those that willingly offered themselves to follow him, he went
out of the cittie, and tooke his waye towardes that part, where he understoode the
rest of the armie was: exhorting and intreating them by the waye that followed
him not to be fainte harted, and ofte holding up his handes to heaven, he be-
sought the goddes to be gracious and favorable unto him, that he might come
in time to the battell, and in a good houre to hazarde his life in defence of his
countrie-men. Now the Romaines when they were put in battell raye, and readye
to take their targettes on their arms, and to girde them upon their arming coates,
had a custome to make their willes at that very instant, without any manner of
writing, naming him only whom they would make their heir in the presence of
three or foure witnesses. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> came just to that reckoning, whilest the souldiers
were doing after that sorte, and that the enemies were approached
so neere, as one stoode in viewe of the other. When they sawe him
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, vi, 26.</note>
at his first comming, all blouddy, and in a swet, and but with a fewe
men following him: some thereupon beganne to be afeard. But soone after,
when they sawe him runne with a lively cheere to the Counsul, and to take him
by the hande, declaring howe he had taken the cittie of Corioles, and that they
sawe the Consul <hi rend="italic">Cominius</hi> also kisse and imbrace him: then there was not a man
but tooke harte againe to him, and beganne to be of a good courage, some hearing
him report from poynt to poynt, the happie successe of this exployte, and other
also coniecturing it by seeing their gestures a farre off. Then they all beganne
to call upon the Consul to martch forward, and to delaye no longer but to give
charge upon the enemie. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> asked him howe the order of their enemies
battell was, and on which side they had placed their best fighting
men. The Consul made him aunswer, that he thought the bandes
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, vi, 63-68.</note>
which were in the vowarde of their battell, were those of the Antiates,
whom they esteemed to be the warlikest men, and which for valiaunt corage
<pb n="627"/>

would give no place, to any of the hoste of their enemies. Then prayed <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi>
to be set directly against them. The Consul granted him, greatly praysing his
courage. Then <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> when both armies came almost to joyne, advaunced
himselfe a good space before his companie, and went so fiercely to give charge
on the voward that came right against him, that they could stand no longer in
his handes: hee made such a lane through them, and opened a passage into the
battell of the enemies. But the two winges of either side turned one to the other,
to compasse him in between them: which the Consul <hi rend="italic">Cominius</hi> perceiving, he
sent thither straight of the best souldiers he had about him. So the battell was
marvellous blouddie about <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> and in a very shorte space many were slaine
in the place. But in the end the Romaines were so strong, that they distressed
the enemies, and brake their arraye: and scattering them, made them flye. Then
they prayed <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> that he would retire to the campe, because they sawe he
was able to do no more, he alreadie so wearied with the great paine he had taken,
and so fainte with the great woundes he had upon him. But <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> aunswered
them, that it was not for conquerours to yeelde, nor to be fainte harted: and
thereupon beganne a freshe to chase those that fledde, untill such time as the
armie of the enemies was utterly overthrowne, and numbers of them slaine and
taken prisoners. The next morning betimes, <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> went to the Consul, and the
other Romaines with him. There the Consul <hi rend="italic">Cominius</hi> going up to his chayr of
state, in the presence of the whole armie, gave thankes to the goddes
for so great, glorious, and prosperous a victorie: then he spake to
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, ix, 5-15.</note>
<hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> whose valiantnesse he commended beyond the moone, both
for that he himselfe sawe him do with his eyes, as also for that Martius had re-
ported unto him. So in the ende he willed <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> that he should choose out
of all the horses they had taken of their enemies, and of all their
goodes they had wonne (whereof there was great store) tenne of everie
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, ix, 40.</note>
sorte which he liked best, before any distribution should be made to
other. Besides this great honourable offer he had made him, he gave
him testimonie that he had wonne that daye the price of prowesse
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, ix, 18.</note>
above all other, a goodly horse with a capparison, and all furniture
to him: which the whole armie beholding, did marvellously praise and commend.
But <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> stepping forth, told the Counsull, he most thankefully
accepted the gift of his horse, and was a glad man besides, that his
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, ix, 46.</note>
service had deserved his generalles commendation: and as for his
other offer, which was rather a mercenarie rewarde, then an honorable recompence,
he would have none of it, but was contented to have his equal part with other
souldiers. Onely, this grace (sayed he) I crave and beseech you to graunt me.
Among the Volsces there is an olde friend and hoast of mine, an honest
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, ix,
98-103.</note>
wealthie man, and now a prisoner, who living before in great wealth
in his owne countrie, liveth nowe a poore prisoner, in the hands of
his enemies: and yet notwithstanding all this his miserie and misfortune, it would
do me great pleasure if I could save him from this one danger: to keepe him from
being solde as a slave. The souldiers hearing <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> wordes, made a marvellous
great shoute among them: and there were more that wondred at his great con-
tentation and abstinence, when they sawe so little covetousnes in him, then they
were that highly praised and extolled his valiantnes. For even they themselves,
that did somewhat malice and envie his glorie, to see him thus honoured, and
passingly praysed did thinke him so much the more worthie of an honorable
recompence for his valiant service, as the more carelesly he refused the great offer
<pb n="628"/>

made unto him for his profitte: and they esteemed more the vertue that was in
him, that made him refuse such rewards, then that which made them to be offered
to him, as unto a worthie person. For it is farre more commendable, to use riches
well, then to be valiant: and yet it is better not to desire them then to use them
well. After this shoute and noyse of the assembly was somewhat appeased; the
Consul <hi rend="italic">Cominius</hi> beganne to speake in this sorte. We cannot compell <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi>
to take these giftes wee offer him if he will not receive them: but we will give him
such a reward for the noble service he hath done, as he cannot refuse. Therefore
we do order and decree, that henceforth he be called <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi>
unlesse his valiant actes have wonne him that name before our
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, ix, 71-78.</note>
nomination. And so ever since, he still bare the third name of <hi rend="italic">Corio-
lanus.</hi> And thereby it appeareth, that the first name the Romaines have, as
<hi rend="italic">Caius:</hi> was our Christian name now. The second as <hi rend="italic">Martius:</hi> was the name of
the house and familie they came of. The third, was some addition given, either
for some act or notable service, or for some marke on their face, or of some shape
of their bodie, or else for some speciall vertue they had. Even so did the Grecians
in olde time give additions to Princes, by reason of some notable acte worthie
memorie. . . . Now when this warre was ended, the flatterers of the people began
to sturre up sedition againe, without any new occasion, or just matter offered of
complaint. For they did ground this second insurrection against the Nobilitie
and Patricians, upon the peoples miserie and misfortune, that could not but
fall out, by reason of the former discorde and sedition betweene them and the
Nobilitie. Because the most part of the arable land within the territorie of Rome,
was become heathie and barren for lacke of plowing, for that they had no time
nor meane to cause corne to be brought them out of other countries to sowe, by
reason of their wars which made the extreame dearth they had among them.
Now those busie pratlers that sought the peoples good will, by such flattering
words, perceiving great scarcitie of corne to be within the citie, and though there
had bene plenty enough, yet the common people had no money to buie it: they
spread abroad false tales and rumors against the Nobilitie, that they
in revenge of the people, had practised and procured the extreame
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, i, 74.</note>
dearth among them. Furthermore, in the middest of this stir, there
came ambassadours to Rome from the citie of Velitres, that offered up their citie
to the Romaines, and praied them they would send new inhabitants to replenish
the same: because the plague had bene so extreame among them, and had killed
such a number of them, as there was not left alive the tenth person of the people
that had bene there before. So the wise men of Rome began to thinke, that the
necessitie of the Velitrians fell out in a most happy houre, and how by this occasion
it was very meere in so great a scarcitie of victuals, to disburden
Rome of a great number of citizens: and by this meanes as well to take
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, i, 243.</note>
away this new sedition, and utterlie to rid it out of the citie, and also
to cleare the same of many mutinous and seditious persons, being the superfluous
ill humours that greevouslie fedde this disease. Hereupon the Consuls prickt
out all those by a bill, whom they intended to send to Velitres, to go dwell there
as in forme of a colonie: and they leavied out of all the rest that remained in the
citie of Rome, a great number to go against the Volsces, hoping by the meanes
of forraine warre, to pacifie their sedition at home. Moreover they imagined,
when the poore with the riche, and the meane sorte with the Nobilitie, should by
this devise be abroad in the warres, and in one campe, and in one service, and in
one like danger: that then they would be more quiet and loving together. But
<pb n="629"/>

<hi rend="italic">Sicinius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Brutus,</hi> two seditious Tribunes, spake against either of these devises,
and cried out upon the noble men, that under the gentle name of a colonie: they
would cloake and colour the most cruell and unnaturall fact as might be: because
they sent their poore citizens into a sore infected citie and pestilent ayre, full of
dead bodies unburied, and there also to dwell under the tuition of a strange god,
that had so cruelly persecuted his people. This were (said they) even as much
as if the Senate should headlong cast downe the people into a most bottomlesse
pit. And are not yet contented to have famished some of the poore citizens here-
tofore to death, and to put other of them even to the mercie of the plague: but a
fresh, they have procured a voluntarie warre, to the end they would leave behinde
no kinde of miseries and ill, wherewith the poore sillie people should not be plagued,
and onely because they are wearie to serve the riche. The common people being
set on a broile and braverie with these wordes, would not appeare when the Con-
suls called their names by a bill, to prest them for the warres, neither would they
be sent out to this new colonie: in so much as the Senate knewe not well what to
say or do in the matter. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> then, who was now growne to great credit, and
a stoute man besides, and of great reputation with the noblest men of Rome, rose
up, and openly spake against these flattering Tribunes. And for the replenishing
of the citie of Velitres, he did compell those that were chosen, to go thither, and to
depart the citie, upon great penalties to him that should disobey: but to the
warres, the people by no meanes would be brought or constrained. So <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi>
taking his friends and followers with him, and such as he could by
faire words intreate to go with him, did runne certaine forreys into
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, iii, 5.</note>
the dominion of the Antiates, where he met with great plentie of
corne, and had a marvellous great spoile, as well of cattell, as of men he had
taken prisoners, whom he brought away with him, and reserved nothing for him-
selfe. Afterwards, having brought backe againe all his men that went out with
him, safe and sound to Rome, and every man riche and loden with spoile: then
the home-tarriers and house-doves that kept Rome still, began to repent them that
it was not their hap to go with him, and so envied both them that had sped so
well in this journey, and also of malice to <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> they spighted to see his credit
and estimation increase still more and more, because they accounted him to be a
great hinderer of the people. Shortly after this, Martius stood for the Consulship:
and the common people favoured his sute, thinking it would be a shame to them
to denie, and refuse the chiefest noble man of bloud, and most worthie person of
Rome, and specially him that had done so great service and good to her common-
wealth. For the custome of Rome was at that time, that such as did sue for any
office, should for certaine dayes before be in the market place, onely
<note anchored="yes" place="left">II, ii,
155-165.</note>
with a poore gowne on their backes, and without any coate under-
neath, to pray the citizens to remember them at the day of election:
which was thus devised, either to move the people the more, by requesting them
in such meane apparell, or else because they might shew them their wounds they
had gotten in the warres in the service of the commonwealth, as manifest markes
and testimonie of their valiantnesse. Now it is not to be thought that the suters
went thus lose in a simple gowne in the market place, without any coate under it,
for feare, and suspition of the common people: for offices of dignitie in the citie
were not then given by favour or corruption. It was but of late time, and long
after this, that buying and selling fell out in election of officers, and that the voices
of the electours were bought for money. . . . Now <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> following this custome,
shewed many woundes and cuts upon his bodie, which he had received in
<pb n="630"/>

seventeene years service at the warres, and in many sundrie battels, being ever the
foremost man that did set out feete to fight. So that there was not
<note anchored="yes" place="left">II, ii,
110-113.</note>
a man among the people, but was ashamed of himselfe, to refuse so
valiant a man: and one of them said to another, we must needes choose
him Consull, there is no remedie. But when the day of election was come, and
that <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> came to the market place with great pompe, accom-
panied with all the Senate, and the whole Nobilitie of the citie about
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i, 35.</note>
him, who sought to make him Consul, with the greatest instance and
intreatie they could, or ever attempted for any man or matter: then the love
and good will of the common people, turned straight to hate and envie toward
him, fearing to put this office of soveraigne authoritie into his hands, being a
man somewhat partiall toward the nobilitie, and of great credit and authoritie
amongst the Patricians, and as one they might doubt would take away altogether
the libertie from the people. Whereupon for these considerations, they refused
<hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> in the end, and made two other that were suters, Consuls. The Senate
being marvellously offended with the people, did accompt the shame of this re-
fusall, rather to redound to themselves, then to <hi rend="italic">Martius:</hi> but <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> tooke it
in farre worse parte then the Senate, and was out of all pacience. For he was a
man too full of passion and choller, and too much given to over selfe will and
opinion, as one of a high minde and great courage, that lacked the gravitie, and
affabilitie that is gotten with judgement of learning and reason, which onely is
to be looked for in a governour of state: and that remembred not how wilfulnesse
is the thing of the world, which a governour of a commonwealth for pleasing should
shun, being that which <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> called solitarinesse. As in the end, all men that are
wilfully given to a selfe opinion and obstinate minde, and who will never yeeld
to others reason, but to their owne: remaine without companie, and forsaken of
all men. For a man that will live in the world, must needs have patience, which
lustie blouds make but a mocke at. So <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> being a stoute man of nature,
that never yeelded in any respect, as one thinking that to overcome alwaies,
and to have the upper hand in all matters, was a token of magnanimitie, and of
no base and faint courage, which spitteth out anger from the most weake and
passioned part of the heart, much like the matter of an impostume: went home to
his house, full fraighted with spight and malice against the people, being accom-
panied with all the lustiest young gentlemen, whose mindes were nobly bent, as
those that came of noble race, and commonly used for to follow and honour him.
But then specially they flockt about him, and kept him companie, to his much
harme: for they did but kindle and inflame his choller more and more, being sorie
with him for the injurie the people offered him, because he was their captaine
and leader to the warres, that taught them all marshall discipline, and stirred
up in them a noble emulation of honour and valiantnesse, and yet without envie,
praising them that deserved best. In the meane season, there came great plentie
of corne to Rome, that had been bought part in Italie, and part was sent out of
Sicile, as given by <hi rend="italic">Gelon</hi> the tyrant of Syracusa: so that many stood in great
hope, that the dearth of victuals being holpen, the civill dissention would also
cease. The Senate sate in counsell upon it immediately, the common people stood
also about the pallace where the counsell was kept, gaping what resolution would
fall out: perswading themselves, that the corne they had bought should be solde
good cheape, and that which was given should be devided by the polle, without
paying any pennie, and the rather, because certaine of the Senatours amongst
them did so wishe and perswade the same. But <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> standing upon his feete,
<pb n="631"/>

did somewhat sharpely take up those, who went about to gratifie the people
therein: and called them people pleasers, and traitours to the nobil-
itie. Moreover, he saied, they nourished against themselves, the
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i, 57-59.</note>
naughtie seede and cockle of insolencie and sedition, which had bene
sowed and scattered abroade amongst the people whom they should have cut off,
if they had bene wise, and have prevented their greatnesse: and not
to their owne destruction to have suffered the people, to stablish a
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i, 88-95.</note>
magistrate for themselves, of so great power and authoritie, as that
man had, to whome they had granted it. Who was also to be feared, because he
obtained what he would, and did nothing but what he listed, neither
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i,
128-132.</note>
passed for any obedience to the Consuls, but lived in all libertie,
acknowledging no superiour to commaund him, saving the onely heads
and authours of their faction, whom he called his magistrates. Therefore saied
he, they that gave counsell, and perswaded that the corne should be given out to
the common people <hi rend="italic">gratis,</hi> as they used to do in the cities of Greece,
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i,
138-140.</note>
where the people had more absolute power: did but onely nourish
their disobedience, which would breake out in the ende, to the utter
ruine and overthrowe of the whole state. For they will not think it is done in
recompense of their service past, sithence they know well enough they have so
oft refused to go the warres, when they were commanded: neither
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i,
147-157.</note>
for their mutinies when they went with us, whereby they have rebelled
and forsaken their countrie: neither for their accusations which their
flatterers have preferred unto them, and they have received, and made good
against the Senate: but they will rather judge, we give and grant them this, as
abasing ourselves, and standing in feare of them, and glad to flatter
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i,
160-166.</note>
them every way. By this meanes, their disobedience will still growe
worse and worse: and they will never leave to practise new sedition,
and uprores. Therefore it were a great follie for us, me thinkes to do it: yea,
shall I say more? we should if we were wise, take from them their
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i,
195-201.</note>
Tribuneship, which most manifestly is the embasing of the Consul-
ship, and the cause of the division of the citie. The state whereof as
it standeth, is not now as it was wonte to be, but becommeth dismembred in two
factions, which maintains alwaies civill dissention and discorde
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i,
131-136.</note>
betweene us, and will never suffer us againe to be united into one
body. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> dilating the matter with many such like reasons,
wonne all the young men, and almost all the riche men to his opinion: in so much
they range it out, that he was the only man, and alone in the city, who stood
out against the people, and never flattered them. There were only a fewe old
men that spake against him, fearing least some mischiefe might fall out upon it,
as indeed there followed no great good afterward. For the Tribunes of the people,
being present at this consultation of the Senate, when they sawe that the opinion
of <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> was confirmed with the more voices, they left the Senate, and went
downe to the people, crying out for helpe, and that they would assemble to save
their Tribunes. Hereupon the people ran on head in tumult together, before
whom the words that <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> spake in the Senate were openly reported: which
the people so stomaked, that even in that furie they were ready to flie upon the
whole Senate. But the Tribunes laide all the fault and burthen
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i,
205-260.</note>
wholly upon <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> and sent their sergeants forthwith to arrest
him, presently to appeare in person before the people, to answer the
words he had spoken in the Senate. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> stoutly withstood these officers that
<pb n="632"/>

came to arrest him. Then the Tribunes in their owne persons, accompanied
with the &AElig;diles, went to fetche him by force, and so laide violent hands upon
him. Howbeit the noble Patricians gathering together about him, made the
Tribunes give back, and laid it sore upon the &AElig;diles: so for that time, the night
parted them, and the tumult appeased. The next morning betimes, the Consuls
seeing the people in an uprore, running to the market place out of all parts of the
citie, they were affraide least all the citie would together by the eares: wherefore
assembling the Senate in all hast, they declared how it stood them upon, to appease
the furie of the people, with some gentle words, or gratefull decrees in their favour:
and moreover, like wise men they should consider, it was not no time to stand at
defence and in contention, nor yet to fight for honour against the communaltie:
they being fallen to so great an extremitie, and offering such imminent danger.
Wherefore they were to consider temperately of things, and to deliver some present
and gentle pacification. The most part of the Senatours that were present at this
counsell, thought this opinion best, and gave their consents unto it. Whereupon
the Consuls rising out of consull, went to speake unto the people as gently as they
could, and they did pacifie their furie and anger, purging the Senate of all the unjust
accusations laid upon them, and used great modestie in perswading them, and also
in reproving the faults they had committed. And as for the rest, that touched the
sale of corne: they promised there should be no disliking offered them in the price.
So the most part of the people being pacified, and appearing so plainly by the great
silence and still that was among them, as yeelding to the Consuls, and liking well
of their words: the Tribunes then of the people rose out of their seates, and said.
Forasmuch as the Senate yeelded unto reason, the people also for their part, as
became them, did likewise give place unto them: but notwith-
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i,
390-398.</note>
standing, they would that <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> should come in person to aunswer
to the articles they had devised. First, whether he had not solicited
and procured the Senate to change the present state of the commonweale, and to
take the soueraigne authoritie out of the peoples hands. Next, when he was
sent for by authoritie of their officers, why he did contemptuously resist and dis-
obey. Lastly, seeing he had driven and beaten the &AElig;diles into the market place
before all the world: if in doing this, hee had not done as much as in him lay, to
raise civill warres, and to set one citizen against another. All this was spoken to
one of these two endes, either that <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> against his nature should be con-
strained to humble himself, and to abase his haughtie and fierce mind: or else if
he continued still in his stoutnesse, he should incurre the peoples dis-
<note anchored="yes" place="left">II, iii,
275-284.</note>
pleasure and ill will so farre, that he should never possibly win them
againe. Which they hoped would rather fall out so, then otherwise:
as in deede they gest unhappily, considering <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> nature and disposition.
So <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> came, and presented himselfe, to answere their accusations against
him, and the people held their peace, and gave attentive eare, to heare what he
would say. But where they thought to have heard very humble and lowly wordes
come from him, he beganne not only to use his wonted boldness of
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, iii,
91-97.</note>
speaking (which of itselfe was very rough and unpleasant, and did
more aggravate his accusation, then purge his innocencie) but also
gave himselfe in his wordes to thunder, and looke therewithall so grimly, as though
he made no reckoning of the matter. This stirred coales among the people, who
were in wonderfull furie at it, &amp; their hate and malice grew so toward him, that
they could hold no longer, beare, nor indure his braverie and carelesse boldnes.
Whereupon <hi rend="italic">Sicinius,</hi> the cruellest and stoutest of the Tribunes, after he had
<pb n="633"/>

whispered a litle with his companions, did openly pronounce in the face of all the
people, <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> as condemned by the Tribunes to die. Then pres-
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, iii,
100-107.</note>
ently he commaunded the &AElig;diles to apprehend him, and carie him
straight to the rocke Tarpeian, and to cast him hedlong downe the
same. When the &AElig;diles came to lay handes upon <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> to do that they were
commanded, divers of the people themselves thought it too cruell
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i,
250-278.</note>
and violent a deede. The noble men also being much troubled to
see such force and rigour used, beganne to crie aloude, helpe <hi rend="italic">Martius:</hi>
so those that laide handes on him being repulsed, they compassed him in round
among themselves, and some of them holding up their handes to the people, be-
sought them not to handle him thus cruelly. But neither their words, nor crying
out could ought prevaile, the tumult and hurly burley was so great, untill such
time as the Tribunes owne friends and kinsemen weying with themselves the
impossiblenesse to convey <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> to execution, without great slaughter &amp; murder
of the nobilitie: did perswade and advise not to proceede in so violent and ex-
traordinarie a sort, as to put such a man to death, without lawfull processe in
lawe, but that they should referre the sentence of his death, to the free voice of the
people. Then <hi rend="italic">Sicinius</hi> bethinking himselfe a litle, did aske the Patricians, for
what cause they tooke <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> out of the officers handes that went
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i,
338-361.</note>
to doe execution? The <hi rend="italic">Patricians</hi> asked him againe, why they
would of themselves so cruelly and wickedly put to death, so noble
and valiant a Romaine as <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> was, and that without law or justice? Well,
then said <hi rend="italic">Sicinius,</hi> if that be the matter, let there be no more quarrell or dis-
sention against the people: for they do grant your demaund, that
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, i,
395-412.</note>
his cause shall be heard according to the law. Therefore said he to
<hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> we doe will and charge you to appeare before the people,
the third day of our next sitting and assembly here, to make your purgation for
such articles as shall be objected against you, that by free voice the people may
give sentence upon you as shall please them. The noble men were glad then
of the adjornment, and were much pleased they had gotten <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> out of this
danger. In the meane space, before the third day of their next cession came about,
the same being kept every ninth day continually at Rome, whereupon they call
it now in Latin, <hi rend="italic">Nundin&aelig;:</hi> there fell out warre against the Antiates, which gave
some hope to the nobilitie, that this adjornment would come to litle effect, thinking
that this warre would hold them so long, as that the furie of the people against
him would be well swaged, or utterly forgotten, by reason of the trouble of the
warres. But contrarie to expectation, the peace was concluded presently with
the Antiates, and the people returned again to Rome. Then the <hi rend="italic">Patricians</hi> assem-
bled oftentimes together, to consult how they might stand to <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> and keepe
the Tribunes from occasion to cause the people to mutinie againe, and rise against
the nobilitie. And there <hi rend="italic">Appius Clodius</hi> (one that was taken ever as an heavie
enemie to the people) did avow and protest, that they would utterly abase the
authoritie of the Senate, and destroy the common weale, if they would suffer the
common people to have authoritie by voices to give judgement against the nobilitie.
On the other side againe, the most auncient Senatours, and such as were given to
favour the common people, saide: that when the people should see they had
authoritie of life and death in their handes, they would not be so cruell and fierce,
but gentle and civill. More also, that it was not for contempt of nobilitie or the
Senate, that they sought to have the authoritie of justice in their handes, as a
preheminence and prerogative of honour: but because they feared, that them-
<pb n="634"/>

selves should be contemned and hated of the nobilitie. So as they were perswaded,
that so soone as they gave them authoritie to judge by voices: so soone would
they leave all envie and malice to condemne any. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> seeing the Senate in
great doubt howe to resolve, partly for the love and good will the nobilitie did
beare him, and partly for the feare they stoode in of the people:
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, iii,
85-88.</note>
asked aloud of the Tribunes, what matter they would burden him
with? The Tribunes aunswered him, that they would shewe howe
he did aspire to be king, and would prove that all his actions tended to usurpe
tyrannicall power over Rome. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> with that, rising up on his feete, saide:
that thereupon he did willingly offer himselfe to the people, to be tried upon that
accusation. And that if it were proved by him, he had so much as once thought
of any such matter, that hee would then refuse no kinde of punishment they
would offer him: conditionally (quoth he) that you charge me with nothing else
besides, and that ye doe not also abuse the Senate. They promised they would
not. Under these conditions the judgement was agreed upon, and the people
assembled. And first of all the Tribunes would in any case (whatsoever became
of it) that the people would proceede to give their voices by Tribes,
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, iii,
12-16.</note>
and not by hundreds: for by this meanes the multitude of the poore
needy people (and all such rable as had nothing to loose, and had
lesse regard of honestie before their eies) came to be of greater force (because
their voices were numbred by the polle) then the noble honest citizens, whose per-
sons and purse did dutifully serve the common wealth in their warres. And
then when the Tribunes saw they could not prove he went about to make himselfe
King: they beganne to broach a fresh the former wordes that <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> had spoken
in the Senate, in hindering the distribution of the corne at meane price unto the
common people, and perswading also to take the office of Tribuneship from them.
And for the third, they charged him a new, that he had not made the common
distribution of the spoyle he had gotten in the invading the territories of the
Antiates: but had of his owne authoritie devided it among them, who were with
him in that journey. But this matter was most straunge of all to <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> looking
least to have bene burdened with that, as with any matter of offence. Whereupon
being burdened on the sodaine; and having no readie excuse to make even at that
instant: he beganne to fall a praising of the souldiers that had served with him
in that journey. But those that were not with him, being the greater number,
cried out so loud, and made such a noise that he could not be heard. To conclude,
when they came to tell the voices of the Tribes, there were three
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, iii, 130.</note>
voices odde, which condemned him to be banished for life. After
declaration of the sentence, the people made such joy, as they never
<note anchored="yes" place="left">III, iii,
168-176.</note>
rejoyced more for any battell they had wonne upon their enemies,
they were so brave and lively, and went home so jocondly from the
assembly, for triumph of this sentence. The Senate againe in contrarie manner
were as sad and heavie, repenting themselves beyond measure, that
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, iii,
21-25.</note>
they had not rather determined to have done and suffered anything
whatsoever, before the common people should so arrogantly and
outragiously have abused their authoritie. There needed no difference of gar-
ments I warrant you, nor outward shewes to know a <hi rend="italic">Plebeian</hi> from a
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, ii, 3-5.</note>
<hi rend="italic">Patrician,</hi> for they were easily discerned by their lookes. For he
that was on the peoples side, looked cheerely on the matter: but he
that was sad, and hung downe his head, he was sure of the noble mens side. Saving
<hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> alone, who neither in his countenance nor in his gate, did ever shew him-
<pb n="635"/>

selfe abashed, or once let fall his great courage: but he onely of all other gentlemen
that were angry at his fortune, did outwardly shew no manner of passion, nor
care at all of himselfe. Not that he did patiently beare and temper
his good hap, in respect of any reason he had, or by his quiet con-
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, i, 19-38.</note>
dition: but because he was so caried away with the vehemencie of
anger, and desire of revenge, that he had no sense nor feeling of the hard state
he was in, which the common people judge not to be sorow, although indeed it
be the very same. For when sorow (as you would say) is set a fire, then it is
converted into spite and malice, and driveth away for that time all faintnesse of
heart and naturall feare. And this is the cause why the cholericke man is so
altered and mad in his actions, as a man set on fire with a burning agew: for
when a mans heart is troubled within, his pulse will beate marvellous strongly.
Now that <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> was even in that taking, it appeared true soone after by his
doings. For when he was come home to his house againe, and had taken his
leave of his mother and wife, finding them weeping and shreeking
out for sorrow, and had also comforted and perswaded them to be
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, i, 3-17.</note>
content with his chaunce: he went immediately to the gate of the
citie, accompanied with a great number of <hi rend="italic">Patricians</hi> that brought him thither,
from whence he went on his way with three or foure of his friendes onely, taking
nothing with him, nor requesting anything of any man. So he remained a few
daies in the countrie at his houses, turmoyled with sundry sorts and kinds of
thoughts, such as the fire of his choller did stirre up. In the end, seeing he could
resolve no way, to take a profitable or honourable course, but onely was pricked
forwarde still to be revenged of the Romaines: he thought to raise up some great
wars against them, by their neerest neighbours. Whereupon he thought it his
best way, first to stirre up the Volsces against them, knowing they were yet able
enough in strength and riches to encounter them, notwithstanding their former
losses they had received not long before, and that their power was not so much
impaired, as their malice and desire was increased to be revenged of the Romaines.
Now in the citie of Antium, there was one called <hi rend="italic">Tullus Aufidius,</hi> who for his
riches, as also for his nobilitie and valiantnesse was honoured among
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, i,
249-253.</note>
the Volsces as a King. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> knewe very well that <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> did
more malice and envie him, then he did all the Romaines besides:
because that many times in battels where they met, they were ever
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, viii.</note>
at the encounter one against another, like lustie couragious youthes,
striving in all emulation of honour, and had encountered many
<note anchored="yes" place="left">I, x.</note>
times together. Insomuch as besides the common quarrell betweene
them, there was bred a marvellous private hate one against another. Yet not-
withstanding, considering that <hi rend="italic">Tullus Aufidius</hi> was a man of a great mind, and
that he above all other of the Volsces most desired revenge of the Romaines, for
the injuries they had done unto them: hee did an acte that confirmed the true
wordes of an auncient Poet, who saide:
<hi rend="blockquote">It is a thing full hard, mans anger to withstand,<lb/>
if it be stiffely bent to take an enterprise in hand.<lb/>
For then most men will have, the thing that they desire,<lb/>
although it cost their lives therefore, such force hath wicked ire.<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>And so did he. For he disguised himselfe in such array and attire, as he thought
no man could ever have knowen him for the person he was, seeing
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, iv, 1-30.</note>
him in that apparell he had upon his backe: and as Homer said of
Ulysses, So did he enter into the enemies towne.
<pb n="636"/>

It was even twy-light when he entred the citie of Antium, and many people
met him in the streets, but no man knew him. So he went directly to <hi rend="italic">Tullus
Aufidius</hi> house, and when he came thither, he got him up straight to
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, v, 27.</note>
the chimney harth, and sate him downe, and spake not a word to
any man, his face all muffled over. They of the house spying him,
wondered what he should be, and yet they durst not bid him rise. For ill favour-
edly muffled and disguised as he was, yet there appeared a certaine
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, v,
162-165.</note>
majestie in his countenance, and in his silence: whereupon they
went to <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> who was at supper, to tell him of the strange disguising
of this man. <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> rose presently from the board, and comming towards him,
asked him what he was, and wherefore he came. Then <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> unmuffled himselfe,
and after he had paused a while, making no answere, he said unto him. If thou
knowest me not yet, <hi rend="italic">Tullus,</hi> and seeing me, dost not perhappes beleeve me to be
the man I am indeede, I must of necessitie bewray myselfe to be that I am. I
am <hi rend="italic">Caius Martius,</hi> who hath done to thy selfe particularly, and to all the Volces
generally, great hurt and mischief, which I cannot denie for my surname of
<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> that I beare. For I never had other benefite nor recompence, of all
the true and painefull service I have done, and the extreme daungers I have bene
in, but this only surname: a good memorie and witnesse of the malice and dis-
pleasure thou shouldest beare me. Indeede the name onely remaineth with me:
for the rest, the envie and crueltie of the people of Rome have taken from me,
by the sufferance of the dastardly nobilitie and magistrates, who have forsaken
me, and let me be banished by the people. This extremitie hath now driven me
to come as a poore suter, to take thy chimney harth, not of any
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, v,
53-106.</note>
hope I have to save my life thereby. For if I had feard death, I
would not have come hither to have put my life in hazard: but prickt
forward with spite and desire I have to be revenged of them that thus have banished
me, whom now I beginne to be avenged on putting my person betweene thy
enemies. Wherefore, if thou hast any heart to be wrecked of the injures thy
enemies have done thee, speede thee now, and let my miserie serve thy turne,
and so use it, as my service may be a benefite to the Volsces: promising thee, that
I will fight with better good will for all you, then I did when I was against you,
knowing that they fight more valiantly, who knowe the force of the enemie, then
such as have never proved it. And if it be so that thou dare not, and that thou
art wearie to prove fortune any more: then am I also wearie to live any longer.
And it were no wisdome in thee, to have the life of him, who hath bene heretofore
thy mortall enemie, and whose service now can nothing helpe nor pleasure thee.
<hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> hearing what he said, was a marvellous glad man, and taking him by the
hande, he saide unto him. Stand up, o <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> and be of good cheere, for in
profering thyselfe unto us, thou dost us great honour: and by this meanes thou
maiest hope also of greater things, at all the Volsces handes. So he feasted him
for that time, and entertained him in the honourablest manner he could, talking
with him in no other matters at that present: but within few daies after, they
fell to consultation together in what sort they should beginne their warres. Now
on the other side, the citie of Rome was in marvellous uprore &amp; discord, the
nobilitie against the communaltie, and chiefely for <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> condemnation and
banishment. . . . Now <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> had secret conference with the greatest
personages of the citie of Antium, declaring unto them, that now they had good
time offered them to make warre with the Romaines, while they were in dis-
sention one with another. They answered them, they were ashamed to breake
<pb n="637"/>

the league, considering that they were sworne to keepe peace for two years. How-
beit shortly after, the Romaines gave them great occasion to make warre with them.
For on a holy day common playes being kept in Rome, upon some suspicion,
or false report, they made proclamation by sound of trumpet, that all the Volsces
should avoide out of Rome before sunne set. Some thinke this was a craft and
deceipt of <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> who sent one to Rome to the Consuls, to accuse the Volsces
falsely, advertising them how they had made a conspiracy to set uppon them,
whilest they were busie in seeing these games, and also to set their city a fire. This
open proclamation made all the Volsces more offended with the Romaines, then
ever they were before: and <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> aggravating the matter, did so inflame the
Volsces against them, that in the end they sent their ambassadours to Rome, to
summon them to deliver their lands and townes againe, which they had taken
from them in times past, or to looke for present warres. The Romaines hearing
this, were marvellously netled: and made no other aunswer but thus. If the
Volsces be the first that beginne warre: the Romaines will be the last will end it.
Incontinently upon returne of the Volsces ambassadours, and deliverie of the
Romaines aunswer: <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> caused an assembly generall to be made of the Volsces,
and concluded to make warre uppon the Romaines. This done, <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> did counsell
them to take <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> into their service, and not to mistrust him for the remem-
braunce of any thing past, but boldly to trust him in any matter to come: for he
would doe them more service in fighting for them, then ever he did them dis-
pleasure in fighting against them. So <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> was called forth, who spake so
excellently in the presence of them all, that he was thought no lesse eloquent in
tongue, then warlike in shew: and declared himselfe both expert in warres, and
wise with valiantnes. Thus he was joyned in commission with <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> as generall
of the Volsces, having absolute authority between them to follow and pursue the
warres. But <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> fearing least tract of time to bring this army
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, vi,
83-101.</note>
together with all the munition and furniture of the Volsces, would
robbe him of the meane he had to execute his purpose and intent:
left order with the rulers and chiefe of the city, to assemble the rest of their power,
and to prepare all necessary provision for the campe. Then he with the lightest
souldiers he had, and that were willing to follow him, stale away uppon the sodaine,
and marched with all speede, and entred the territories of Rome, before the
Romains heard any newes of his comming. In so much as the Volsces found
such spoile in the fields, as they had more then they could spend in their campe,
and were weary to drive and cary away that they had. Howbeit the gaine of
the spoile and the hurt they did to the Romaines in this invasion, was the least
part of his intent. For his chiefest purpose was, to increase still the malice and
dissention between the nobility, and the communalty: and to draw that on, he
was very carefull to keepe the noble mens landes and goods safe from harme and
burning, but spoiled all the whole countrey besides, and would suffer no man to
take or hurt any thing of the noble mens. This made greater sturre and broile
between the nobility &amp; the people, then was before. For the noble
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, vi,
137-143.</note>
men fell out with the people, because they had so unjustly banished
a man of so great valure and power. The people on the other side,
accused the nobility, how they had procured <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> to make these wars, to be
revenged of them: because it pleased them to see their goods burnt
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, vi,
105-111.</note>
and spoiled before their eyes, whilest themselves were well at ease,
and did behold the peoples losses and misfortunes, and knowing
their owne goods safe and out of daunger: and how the warre was not made against
<pb n="638"/>

the noble men, that had the enemy abroad, to keepe that they had in safety. Now
<hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> having done this first exploite (which made the Volsces bolder, and lesse
fearefull of the Romaines) brought home all the army againe, without losse of any
man. After their whole army (which was marvellous great, and very forward
to service) was assembled in one campe: they agreed to leave part of it for garrison
in the country about, and the other part should goe on, and make the warre upon
the Romaines. So <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> bad <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> choose, and take which of the two charges
he liked best. <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> made him aunswere, hee knew by experience that <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi>
was no lesse valiant than himselfe, and how hee ever had better fortune and good
happe in all battells, then him selfe had. Therefore he thought it best for him
to have the leading of those that should make the warres abroad: and him selfe
would keep home, to provide for the safetie of the cities and of his countrey, and
to furnish the campe also of all necessary provision abroade. So <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> being
stronger then before, went first of all unto the city of Cercees, inhabited by the
Romaines, who willingly yeelded them selves, and therefore had no hurt. From
thence he entred the countrey of the Latines, imagining the Romaines would
fight there, to defend the Latines, who were their confederates, &amp; had many times
sent unto the Romaines for their aide. But on the one side, the people of Rome
were very ill willing to goe: and on the other side the Consuls being upon their
going out of their office, would not hazard them selves for so small a time: so that
the ambassadours of the Latines returned home againe, and did no good. Then
<hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> did besiege their cities, and having taken by force the townes of the
Tolerinians, Vicanians, Pedanians, and the Bolanians, who made resistaunce: hee
sacked all their goods, and tooke them prisoners. Such as did yeeld them selves
willingly unto him, he was as carefull as possible might be, to defend them from
hurt: and because they should receive no damage by his will, he removed his
campe as farre from their confines as he could. Afterwards, he tooke the city of
Boles by assault, being about an hundred furlong from Rome, where he had a
marvellous great spoile, and put every man to the sword that was able to carie
weapon. The other Volsces that were appointed to remaine in garrison for defence
of their countrey, hearing this good news, would tary no longer at
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, vii,
1-35.</note>
home, but armed themselves, and ranne to <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> campe, saying they
did acknowledge no other captaine but him. Hereupon his fame
ranne through al Italie, and every one praised him for a valiant captaine, for that
by change of one man for another, such and so straunge events fell out in the
state. In this while, all went still to wracke at Rome. For, to come
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, i, 20-22.</note>
into the field to fight with the enemy, they could not abide to heare
of it, they were one so much against another, and full of seditious
wordes, the nobility against the people, and the people against the nobility.
Untill they had intelligence at the length that the enemies had laide siege to the
city of Lavinium, in the which were all the temples and images of the goddes their
protectours, and from whence came first their auncient originall, for that &AElig;neas
at his first arrivall into Italie did builde that citie. Then fell there out a mar-
vellous sodaine chaunge of minde among the people, and farre more
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, vi,
174-197.</note>
straunge and contrary in the nobility. For the people thought good
to repeale the condemnation and exile of <hi rend="italic">Martius.</hi> The Senate
assembled uppon it, would in no case yeeld to that. Who either did it of a selfe
will to bee contrary to the peoples desire: or because <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> should not returne
through the grace and favour of the people. Or else, because they were throughly
angry and offended with him, that he would set uppon the whole, being offended
<pb n="639"/>

but by a few, and in his doinges would shew him selfe as open enemy besides unto
his countrey: notwithstanding the most part of them tooke the wrong they had
done him, in marvellous ill part, and as if the injurie had beene done unto them-
selves. Report being made of the Senates resolution, the people found them-
selves in a straight: for they coulde authorise and confirme nothing by their
voices, unlesse it had beene first propounded and ordained by the Senate. But
<hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> hearing this sturre about him, was in a greater rage with them then
before: in so much as he raised his siege incontinently before the city of Lavinium,
and going towardes Rome, lodged his campe within forty furlong of the citie,
at the ditches called <hi rend="italic">Cluili&aelig;.</hi> His incamping so neare Rome, did put all the whole
city in a wonderfull feare: howbeit for the present time it appeased the sedition
and dissention betwixt the Nobility and the people. For there was no Consull,
Senatour, nor Magistrate, that durst once contrary the opinion of the people,
for the calling home againe of <hi rend="italic">Martius.</hi> When they saw the women in a mar-
vellous feare, running up and downe the city: the temples of the goddes full of
olde people, weeping bitterly in their prayers to the goddes: and finally, not a
man either wise or hardy to provide for their safety: then they were all of opinion,
that the people had reason to call home <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> againe, to reconcile them selves
to him, and that the Senate on the contrary part, were in marvellous great fault
to bee angry and in choller with him, when it stoode them uppon rather to have
gone out and intreated him. So they all agreede together to send ambassadours
unto him, to let him understand how his countrey men did call him
home againe, and restored him to all his goods, and besought him to
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, i.</note>
deliver them from this warre. The ambassadours that were sent, were
<hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> familiar friends, and acquaintaunce, who looked at the least for a curteous
welcome of him, as of their familiar friend and kinseman. Howbeit they found
nothing lesse. For at their comming, they were brought through the campe,
to the place where he was set in his chaire of state, with a marvellous
and an unspeakeable majesty, having the chiefest men of the Volsces
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, iv, 21-44.</note>
about him: so hee commaunded them to declare openly the cause of
their comming. Which they delivered in the most humble and lowly wordes
they possibly could devise, and with all modest countenaunce and behaviour
agreable for the same. When they had done their message: for the injury they
had done him, he aunswered them very whotly, and in great choller. But as
generall of the Volsces, he willed them to restore unto the Volsces, all their landes
and cities they had taken from them in former warres: and moreover, that they
should give them the like honour and freedome of Rome, as they had before given
to the Latines. For otherwise they had no other meane to end this warre, if they
did not graunt these honest and just conditions of peace. Thereupon he gave
them thirty daies respit to make him aunswere. So the ambassadours returned
straight to Rome, and <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> forthwith departed with his army out of the terri-
tories of the Romaines. This was the first matter wherewith the Volsces (that
most envied <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> glory and authority) did charge <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> with. Among
those, <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> was chief: who though hee had received no private injurie or dis-
pleasure of <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> yet the common fault and imperfection of mans nature
wrought in him, and it grieved him to see his owne reputation blem-
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, vii,
18-28.</note>
ished, through <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> great fame and honour, and so him selfe to be
lesse esteemed of the Volsces, then he was before. This fell out the
more, because every man honoured <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> and thought he only could do all,
and that all other governors and captaines must be content with such credite
<pb n="640"/>

and authority, as he would please to countenaunce them with. From hence they
derived all their first accusations and secret murmurings against <hi rend="italic">Martius.</hi> For
private captains conspiring against him, were very angry with him: and gave it
out, that the removing of the campe was a manifest treason, not of
<note anchored="yes" place="left">IV, vii,
3-10.</note>
the townes, nor fortes, nor of armes, but of time and occasion, which
was a losse of great importaunce, because it was that which in treason
might both lose and binde all, and preserve the whole. Now <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> having given
the Romaines thirty daies respit for their answer, and specially because the wars
have not accustomed to make any great changes, in lesse space of time then that:
hee thought it good yet, not to lie a sleepe and idle all the while, but went and
destroyed the lands of the enemies allies, and tooke seven great cities of theirs
well inhabited, and the Romaines durst not once put themselves into the fielde,
to come to their aide and helpe: they were so fainte hearted, so mistrustfull, and
loth besides to make warres. In so much as they properly resembled the bodies
paralyticke, and losed of their limmes and members: as those which through the
palsey have lost all their sence and feeling. Wherefore, the time of peace expired,
<hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> being returned into the dominions of the Romaines againe
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, iii,
19-21.</note>
with all his army, they sent another ambassade unto him, to pray
peace, and the remove of the Volsces out of their countrey: that
afterwardes they might with better leysure fall to such agreementes together, as
should bee thought most meete and necessary. For the Romaines were no men
that would ever yeelde for feare. But if he thought the Volsces had any ground
to demaund resonable articles and conditions, all that they would reasonably
aske should be graunted unto, by the Romaines, who of them selves would will-
ingly yeelde to reason, conditionally, that they did lay downe armes. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi>
to that aunswered: that as generall of the Volsces he would reply
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, i, 78-82.</note>
nothing unto it. But yet as a Romaine citizen, he would counsell
them to let fall their pride, and to be conformable to reason, if they
were wise: and that they should returne againe within three daies, delivering up
the articles agreed upon, which he had first delivered them. Or otherwise, that
hee would no more give them assuraunce or safe conduite to returne againe into
his campe, with such vaine and frivolous messages. When the ambassadours
were returned to Rome, and had reported <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> aunswer to the Senate: their city
being in extreame daunger, and as it were in a terrible storme or tempest, they
threw out (as the common proverbe saieth) there holy ancker. For then they
appointed all the bishoppes, priestes, ministers of the gods, and keepers of holy
thinges, and all the augures or soothsayers, which foreshew thinges to come by
observation of the flying of birdes (which is an olde auncient kinde of prophecying
and divination amongest the Romaines) to goe to <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> apparelled, as when they
doe their sacrifices: and first to intreate him to leave off warre, and then that hee
would speake to his countrey men, and conclude peace with the Volsces. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi>
suffered them to come into his campe, but yet he granted them nothing the more,
neither did he entertaine them or speake more curteously to them, then he did
the first time that they came unto him, saving onely that hee willed them to take
the one of the two: eyther to accept peace under the first conditions offered, or
else to receive warre. When all this, goodly rable of superstition and priestes
were returned, it was determined in counsell that none should goe out of the gates
of the citie, and that they should watch and ward uppon the walls, to repulse their
enemies if they came to assault them: referring themselves and all their hope to
time, and fortunes uncertaine favour, not knowing otherwise how to remedy the
<pb n="641"/>

daunger. Now all the city was full of tumult, feare, and marvellous doubt what
would happen: untill at the length there fell out such a like matter,
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, iv,
35-40.</note>
as Homer oftimes saide they would least have thought of. For in
great matters, that happen seldome, Homer saieth, and crieth out
in this sort.
<hi rend="blockquote">The goddesse Pallas she, with her faire glistering eyes,<lb/>
did put into his minde such thoughts, and made him so devise. . . . . .<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>Now the Romaine ladies and gentlewomen did visite all the temples and gods
of the same, to make their praiers unto them: but the greatest ladies (and more
part of them) were continuallie about the aulter of <hi rend="italic">Jupiter Capitolin,</hi> among which
troope by name, was <hi rend="italic">Valeria, Publicolaes</hi> owne sister. The selfe same <hi rend="italic">Publicola,</hi>
who did such notable service to the Romaines, both in peace and
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, iii, 71-74.</note>
warres: and was dead also certaine yeares before, as we have declared
in his life. His sister <hi rend="italic">Valeria</hi> was greatly honoured and reverenced among all
the Romaines: and did so modestly and wisely behave herselfe, that she did not
shame nor dishonour the house she came off. So she sodainly fell into such a
fansie, as we have rehearsed before, and had (by some god as I thinke) taken hold
of a noble devise. Whereupon she rose, and the other ladies with her, and they
all together went straight to the house of <hi rend="italic">Volumnia, Martius</hi> mother: and comming
in to her, found her, and <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> wife her daughter in law set together, and having
her husband <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> young children in her lap. Now all the traine of these ladies
sitting in a ring round about her: <hi rend="italic">Valeria</hi> first began to speake in this sort unto her.
We ladies, are come to visite you ladies (my lady <hi rend="italic">Volumnia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Virgilia</hi>) by no
direction from the Senate, nor commaundement of other magistrate: but through
the inspiration (as I take it) of some god above. Who having taken compassion
and pittie of our praiers, hath moved us to come unto you, to intreate you in a
matter, as well beneficiall for us, as also for the whole citizens in general: but to
yourselves in especiall (if it please you to credit me) and shall redound to our more
fame and glorie, then the daughters of the Sabynes obtained in former age, when
they procured loving peace, instead of hatefull war, between their fathers and their
husbands. Come on good ladies, and let us go altogether unto <hi rend="italic">Martius,</hi> to intreat
him to take pittie upon us, and also to report the trothe unto him, how much you
are bound unto the citizens: who notwithstanding they have sustained great
hurt and losses by him, yet they have not hitherto sought revenge upon your
persons by any discourteous usage, neither ever conceived any such thought or
intent against you, but do deliver you safe into his hands, though thereby they
looke for no better grace or clemencie from him. When <hi rend="italic">Valeria</hi> had spoken this
unto them, all the other ladies together with one voice confirmed that she had
said. Then <hi rend="italic">Volumnia</hi> in this sort did aunswer her. My good ladies, we are
partakers with you of the common miserie and calamitie of our countrie, and yet
our griefe exceedeth yours the more, by reason of our particular misfortune: to
feele the losse of my sonne <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> former valiancie and glorie, and to see his person
environed now with our enemies in armes, rather to see him forth comming &amp;
safe kept, then of any love to defend his person. But yet the greatest griefe of
our heaped mishaps is, to see our poore country brought to such extremitie, that
all the hope of the safetie and preservation thereof, is now unfortunately cast
upon us simple women: because we know not what account he will make of us,
since he hath cast from him all care of his naturall countrie and common weale,
which heretofore he hath holden more deere and precious, then either his mother,
<pb n="642"/>

wife or children. Norwithstanding, if ye thinke we can do good, we will willingly
do what you will have us: bring us to him I pray you. For if we cannot prevaile,
we may yet dye at his feete, as humble suters for the safetie of our countrie. Her
aunswer ended, she tooke her daughter in lawe, and <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> children with her,
and being accompanied with all the other Romaine ladies, they went in troupe
together unto the Volsces campe: whom when they sawe, they of themselves did
both pitty and reverence her, and there was not a man among them that once
durst say a word unto her. Now was <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> set then in his chaire of state, with
all the honours of a generall, and when he had spied the women coming a farre
off, he marvelled what the matter ment: but afterwards knowing his wife which
came formost, he determined at the first to persist in his obstinate and inflexible
rancker. But overcome in the end with natural affection, and being
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, iii,
25-40.</note>
altogether altered to see them: his heart would not serve him to tarie
their comming to his chaire, but comming downe in hast, he went
to meete them, and first he kissed his mother, and imbraced her a prety while,
then his wife and little children. And nature so wrought with him, that the
teares fell from his eyes, and he could not keepe himself from making much of
them, but yeelded to the affection of his bloud, as if he had bene violently caried
with the furie of a most swift running streame. After he had thus lovingly received
them, and perceiving that his mother <hi rend="italic">Volumnia</hi> would begin to speake
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, iii, 102.</note>
to him, he called the chiefest of the counsell of the Volsces to heare
what she would say. Then she spake in this sort. If we helde our
peace (my sonne) and determined not to speake, the state of our poore bodies,
and present sight of our raiment, would easily bewray to thee what
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, iii,
104-135.</note>
life we have led at home, since thy exile and abode abroad. But
thinke now with thy selfe, how much more unfortunately, then all
the women living we are come hither, considering that the sight which should be
most pleasant to all other to behold, spightfull fortune hath made most fearefull
to us: making my selfe to see my sonne, and my daughter here, her husband, be-
sieging the walles of his native countrie. So as that which is the onely comfort
to all other in their adversitie and miserie, to pray unto the gods, and to call to
them for aide: is the onely thing which plungeth us into most deepe perplexitie.
For we cannot (alas) together pray, both for victorie, for our countrie, and for
safetie of thy life also: but a world of grievous curses, yea more then any mortall
enemie can heape upon us, are forcibly wrapt up in our praiers. For the bitter
sop of most harde choice is offered thy wife and children, to forgo the one of the
two; either to lose the person of thy selfe, or the nurse of their native countrie.
For my selfe (my sonne) I am determined not to tarie, till fortune in my life time
do make an end of this warre. For if I cannot perswade thee, rather to do good
unto both parties, then to overthrow and destroy the one, preferring love and
nature, before the malice and calamitie of warres: thou shalt see, my sonne,
and trust unto it, thou shalt no sooner marche forward to assault thy countrie,
but thy foote shall treade upon thy mothers wombe, that brought thee first into
this world. And I may not deferre to see the day, either that my sonne be led
prisoner in triumph by his naturall countrymen, or that he himselfe do triumphe
of them, and of his naturall countrie. For if it were so, that my request tended
to save thy country, in destroying the Volsces: I must confesse, thou wouldst
hardly and doubtfully resolve on that. For as to destroy thy naturall countrie,
it is altogether unmeete and unlawfull: so were it not just, and lesse honorable,
to betray those that put their trust in thee. But my only demaund consisteth,
<pb n="643"/>

to make a gaile deliverie of all evils, which delivereth equall benefit and safetie,
both to the one and the other, but most honorable for the Volsces. For it shall
appeare, that having victorie in their hands, they have of speciall favour granted
us singular graces: peace, and amitie, albeit themselves have no lesse part of
both, then we. Of which good, if so it came to passe, thy selfe is the onely author,
and so hast thou the only honour. But if it faile, and fall out contrarie: thy selfe
alone deservedly shall carie the shamefull reproach and burthen of either partie.
So, though the end of warre be uncertaine, yet this notwithstanding is most cer-
taine: that if it be thy chance to conquer, this benefit shalt thou reape of thy goodly
conquest, to be chronicled the plague and destroier of thy countrie. And if fortune
also overthrow thee, then the world will say, that through desire to revenge thy
private injuries, thou hast for ever undone thy good friends, who did most lovingly
and courteouslie receive thee. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> gave good eare unto his mothers words,
without interrupting her speach at all: and after she had said what she would,
he held his peace a prety while, and answered not a word. Hereupon she began
againe to speak unto him, and said. My sonne, why doest thou not
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, iii,
165-193.</note>
answer me? doest thou thinke it good altogether to give place unto
thy choller and desire of revenge, and thinkest thou it no honestie
for thee to graunt thy mothers request, in so weighty a cause? doest thou take
it honorable for a noble man, to remember the wrongs and injuries done him:
and doest not in like case thinke it an honest noble mans parte, to be thankfull
for the goodnesse that parents do shew to their children, acknowledging the dutie
and reverence they ought to beare unto them? No man living is more bound
to shew himselfe thankefull in all parts and respects, then thy selfe: who so
unnaturally sheweth all ingratitude. Moreover (my sonne) thou hast sorely
taken of thy country, exacting grievous paiments upon them, in revenge of the
injuries offered thee: besides, thou hast not hitherto shewed thy poore mother any
courtesie. And therefore, it is not only honest, but due unto me, that without
compulsion I should obtaine my so just and reasonable request of thee. But
since by reason I cannot perswade thee to it, to what purpose do I defer my last
hope? And with these words, her selfe, his wife and children, fell downe upon
their knees before him. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> seeing that, could refraine no longer, but went
straight and lift her up, crying out: Oh mother, what have you done
to me? And holding her hard by the right hand, oh mother, said
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, iii,
195-200.</note>
he, you have wonne a happy victorie for your countrie, but mortall
and unhappy for your sonne: for I see my selfe vanquished by you
alone. These words being spoken openly, he spake a litle apart with
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, iii,
211-213.</note>
his mother and wife, and then let them returne againe to Rome, for
so they did request him: and so remaining in campe that night, the
next morning he dislodged, and marched homewards into the Volsces countrie
againe, who were not all of one minde, nor all alike contented. For some mis-
liked him, and that he had done. Other being well pleased that peace should
be made, said: that neither the one, nor the other, deserved blame nor reproche.
Other, though they misliked that was done, did not thinke him an ill man for that
he did, but said: he was not to be blamed, though he yeelded to such a forcible
extremitie. Howbeit no man contraried his departure, but all obeied his com-
mandement, more for respect of his worthinesse and valiancie, then for feare of
his authoritie. Now the citizens of Rome plainly shewed, in what feare and
danger their citie stood of this war, when they were delivered. For so soone as
the watch upon the wals of the citie perceived the Volsces campe to remove, there
<pb n="644"/>

was not a temple in the citie but was presently set open, and full of men, wearing
garlands of flowers upon their heads sacrificing to the gods, as they
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, iv,
42-69.</note>
were wont to do upon the newes of some great obtained victorie. And
this common joy was yet more manifestly shewed, by the honour-
able courtesies the whole Senate, and people did bestow on their ladies. For they
were all throughly perswaded, and did certainly beleeve, that the ladies onely
were cause of the saving of the citie, and delivering themselves from the instant
danger of the war. Whereupon the Senate ordained, that the magistrates to
gratifie and honour these ladies, should grant them all that they would require.
And they onely requested that they would builde a temple of Fortune
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, iii,
221, 222.</note>
of the women, for the building whereof they offered themselves to
defray the whole charge of the sacrifices, &amp; other ceremonies belonging
to the service of the gods. Neverthelesse, the Senate commending their good
will and forwardnesse, ordained, that the temple and image should be made at the
common charge of the citie. . . . Now when <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> was returned againe into
the citie of Antium from his voyage, <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> that hated and could no longer abide
him for the feare he had of his authoritie: sought diverse meanes to make him
out of the way, thinking if he let slip that present time, he should
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, vi, 2-56.</note>
never recover the like and fit occasion againe. Wherefore <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi>
having procured many other of his confederacie, required <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi>
might be deposed from his estate, to render up account to the Volsces of his charge
&amp; government. <hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> fearing to become a private man again under <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi>
being generall (whose authority was greater otherwise, then any other among all
the Volsces) answered: he was willing to give up his charge, and
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, vi,
79-85.</note>
would resigne it into the hands of the lords of the Volsces, if they did
all command him, as by all their commandement he received it.
And moreover, that he would not refuse even at that present to give up an account
unto the people, if they would tarie the hearing of it. The people hereupon called
a common counsell, in which assembly there were certaine oratours appointed,
that stirred up the common people against him; &amp; when they had told their tales,
<hi rend="italic">Martius</hi> rose up to make them answer. Now, notwithstanding the mutinous people
made a marvelos great noise, yet when they saw him, for the reverence they bare
unto his valiantnesse, they quieted themselves, and gave still audience to alledge
with leasure what he could for his purgation. Moreover, the honestest men of
the Antiates, and who most rejoyced in peace, shewed by their countenance that
they would heare him willingly, and judge also according to their conscience.
Whereupon <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi> fearing that if he did let him speake, he would prove his inno-
cencie to the people, because amongst other things he had an eloquent tongue,
besides that the first good service he had done to the people of the Volsces, did
win him more favour, then these last accusations could purchase him displeasure:
and furthermore, the offence they laide to his charge, was a testimonie of the good
will they ought him, for they would never have thought he had done them wrong
for that they tooke not the citie of Rome, if they had not bene very neere taking
of it, by meanes of his approache and conduction. For these causes <hi rend="italic">Tullus</hi>
thought he might no longer delay his pretence and enterprise, neither to tarie
for the mutining and rising of the common people against him: wherefore, those
that were of the conspiracie, beganne to crie out that he was not to
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, vi,
145-156.</note>
be heard, nor that they would not suffer a traytour to usurpe ty-
rannicall power over the Tribe of the Volsces, who would not yeeld up
his estate and authoritie. And in saying these words, they all fell upon him, and
<pb n="645"/>
killed him in the market place, none of the people once offering to rescue him.
Howbeit it is a clere case, that this murder was not generally con-
<note anchored="yes" place="left">V, vi,
175-189.</note>
sented unto, of the most part of the Volsces: for men came out of
all partes to honour his bodie, and did honourably burie him, set-
ting out his tombe with great store of armour and spoiles, as the tombe of a
worthy person and great captaine.

<div2 type="subsection" n="Jacobs"><head>Jacobs</head>
<p><bibl><ref target="jacobs-1889" targOrder="U"><hi rend="smallcap">Jacobs</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Fables of &AElig;sop,</hi> i, 82)</ref></bibl> gives the following variants of this fable, 
beginning with the earliest version (see his note on I, i, 99):</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trial of Belly v. Head&mdash;wherein are published the pleadings made before the
supreme judges&mdash;while their President watched to unmask the liar&mdash;his eye
never ceased to watch. The due rites having been done&mdash;in honour of the god
who detests iniquity&mdash;after the Belly had spoken his plea&mdash;the Head began a
long harangue:
<quote>&lsquo;'Tis I, the rafter of the whole house&mdash;whence the beams issue and where they
join together&mdash;all the members . . . on me and rejoice. My forehead is joyous&mdash;
members are vigorous&mdash;the neck stands firm beneath the head&mdash;my eye sees afar
off&mdash;the nostril expands and breathes the air&mdash;the ear opens and hears&mdash;the
mouth sends forth sound and talks&mdash;the two arms are vigorous&mdash;and cause a man
to be respected&mdash;he marches with head erect&mdash;looks the great in the face as well
as the lowly. . . . 'Tis I that am their queen&mdash;'tis I the head of my companions.
. . . Who would play a trick&mdash;or is there any would say&mdash;&ldquo;Is it not false?&rdquo; Let
them call me the head&mdash;'tis I that cause to live. . . .&rsquo;</quote></p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; adds Jacobs, &lsquo;the fragment breaks off, and we cannot tell if judgment
went with the plaintiff as in the Roman fable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He continues with the fable as in the Upanishads:
<text><body>
<head>Dispute of the Senses and the Soul.</head>
<p>The senses disputed among themselves saying, &lsquo;I am the first, I am the first.&rsquo;
They said: &lsquo;Let us go out of the body, whichever shall cause the body to fall by
its departure shall be the first.&rsquo; The word departed, the man spoke no more, but
he still ate, drank, and lived; the sight departed, the man saw not, but still ate,
drank, and lived; (and so with the hearing, &amp;c.); the mind went forth, intelligence
left the man, but he still ate, drank, and lived. The soul departed, no sooner was
it without than the body fell. (They again disputed and tried who could raise
the body, with the same result.)</p>
</body></text></p>
<p>Jacobs says further that a somewhat similar fable exists in the Chinese Budd-
histic work Avadanas (No. 105); and it occurs also in the Pantschatantra:
<text><body>
<head>The Bird with Two Heads.</head>
<p>&lsquo;Once on a time on Mount Himavat there was a bird named Jivanjiva. This
had one body and two heads, one of which used to eat fine fruit to give strength
and vigour to the body. The other became jealous and thought, &ldquo;Why should
that head always eat fine fruit, of which I never taste one?&rdquo; Accordingly it ate a
poisonous fruit and the two heads perished at the same time.</p>
</body></text>

</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have also found a Jewish variant, though with a somewhat different moral:
<text><body>
<head>The Tongue and the Members.<lb/>
(Schocher Tob on Ps. xxxix, I.).</head>

<p>&lsquo;A Persian King sick unto death was ordered the milk of a lioness (Heb. Lebia).
(A man obtains it after many adventures.) On his return the members disputed
in the night. The feet said, &ldquo;Had we not gone the milk had not been got&rdquo;: the
hands, &ldquo;We milked; that was the chief thing&rdquo;: the eyes, &ldquo;But for us the lioness
could not have been found out.&rdquo; The heart reminds them of her wise counsels.
At last spoke the tongue, &ldquo;But for me where would you have been?&rdquo; To the
retorts of the other members, the only reply is, &ldquo;You'll soon see!&rdquo; Next morning
the man came before the King and handing him the milk, said, &ldquo;There is the milk
of the bitch&rdquo; (Heb. Kalba). (The man is ordered off to execution.) On the scaffold
the members wept, but the tongue laughed. &ldquo;What did I tell you? Are you not
all in my power? However, I'll take pity on you.&rdquo; The tongue called out,
&ldquo;Lead me once more to the King.&rdquo; In his presence it said, &ldquo;I have truly brought
you the milk of a lioness, Sire. Kalba is Arabic for lioness.&rdquo; They tasted, and
tried, and found it right, and sent the man away with great gifts. Then said the
tongue, &ldquo;See now, life and death are in my hand&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">Prov.</hi> xviii, 21).</p>
</body></text></p>
<p>&lsquo;There still remain a number of Indian parallels to our fables, in what I call
the Mesozoic stratum of the Bidpai literature&mdash;passages, that is, which formed
part of the original form of the book, but cannot be traced back among the Jatakas.
Taken by themselves, they could scarcely be adduced as valid evidence, as they
cannot be traced back even as early as 300 A. D., when the Greco-Roman collec-
tions were already in existence. But the Jatakas have shown us evidence of
similar stories being current in India from five to seven centuries before that,
and the analogues from the Indian epic can trace back nearly as far. Besides
Indian writers were veritable Jeremy Diddlers in the way of literary borrowing,
and the whole of the Bidpai, even in its earliest form, strikes one as a vast plagiar-
ism. It becomes, therefore, probable that the Bidpai stories of the Mesozoic
stratum have the same antiquity as the Jatakas or the Mahabharata. We may
therefore proceed to add to our previous parallels such of these as have close
analogy with Greek fables, being somewhat more particular as to the closeness of
the parallelism than we were in the case of the Jatakas or the epic references.&rsquo;

<quote><p>We will consider the speech of the Second Citizen to Menenius
in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> (I, i, 119-122), in reference to the latter's fable of the &lsquo;Belly and the

<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,</l>

  <bibl n="shak. cor 1.1">shak. cor 1.1.119</bibl></cit>

a speech to which Menenius retorts by calling the citizen the great toe of the
assembly.</p>
<p>It hardly needs to be said that this is medieval, in the full style of medieval
allegory. It resembles the symbolism of the Two Lights, the Sun and the Moon,
on which so much of the argumentation between the Empire and the Papacy was
based, or that other symbolism of the Two Swords, of which Christ said &lsquo;It is
enough,&rsquo; and on which plenty will be found said in the controversies of Dante with
<pb n="647"/>
the Pope. The analogy of the body politic with the body physical is of course not
only very old, but very natural; but in the Middle Ages it shared the fate of many
analogies and was pressed to its utmost limits with scholastic thoroughness. As
Taylor tells us (<hi rend="italic">Medi&aelig;val Mind,</hi> II, 276) it was used to symbolize the mystery of
the oneness of all mankind in God, and the organic co-ordination of all sorts and
conditions of men with one another in the divine commonwealth on earth; it
was also drawn out into every detail of banal anthropomorphic comparison.
From John of Salisbury to Nicholas Cusanus, Occam and Dante, no point of
fancied analogy between the parts and members of the body and the various func-
tions of Church and State was left unexploited.</p>
<p>And similarly Gierke (<hi rend="italic">Political Theories of the Middle Ages,</hi> trans. Maitland,
pp. 22 sq.) tells us that John of Salisbury made the first attempt to find some mem-
ber of the natural body which would correspond to each portion of the State. . . .
Later writers followed him, but with many variations in minor matters. The most
elaborate comparison comes from Nicholas of Cusa, who for this purpose brought
into play all the medical knowledge of his time.</p>
<p>As, in fact, we read the medieval political treatises, we are reminded of the
monkish work, <foreign lang="la">De partibus Virginis Mari&aelig;,</foreign> in which the limbs of the Virgin are
tortured one by one into the most extraordinary mystical meanings. Some of
the parallels, of course, are natural enough: that the head, for instance, should be
the King is not surprising. The eye, again, might well be a sentry or a watchful
magistrate, and the arm is easily supposed to be a soldier. But that the heart
should be the counsellor or senator does a little astonish us; and it is precisely
here that we begin to suspect Shakspere of medievalism, and to see that he is not
drawing out a symbolism of his own, but adopting one ready-made. For, in the
medieval writings on law or politics, it is almost always <hi rend="italic">cor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pectus</hi> that is
<hi rend="italic">Senatus.</hi> Take, for example, the <hi rend="italic">Policraticus</hi> of John of Salisbury&mdash;perhaps the
most representative of all these writings. Basing himself, as he professes, on the
so-called Plutarch's <hi rend="italic">Institutio Trajani,</hi> John writes as follows (<hi rend="italic">Policraticus,</hi> ed.
Webb, I, 283, section 540 <hi rend="italic">c</hi>): &lsquo;Princeps vero capitis in re publica optinet locum uni
subjectus Deo et his qui vices illius agunt in terris, quoniam et in corpore humano
ab anima vegetatur caput et regitur. Cordis locum senatus optinet, a quo bonorum
operum et malorum procedunt initia. Oculorum aurium et linguae officia vendicant
sibi judices et praesides provinciarum. Officiales et milites manibus coaptantur.
Qui semper adsistunt principi, lateribus assimilantur. Quaestores et commenta-
rienses (non illos dico qui carceribus praesunt, sed comites rerum privatarum) ad
ventris et intestinorum refert imaginem. Quae, si immensa aviditate congesserint
et congesta tenacius reservaverint, innumerabiles et incurabiles generant morbo, ut
vitis eorum totius corporis ruina immineat. Pedibus vero solo jugiter inherentibus
agricolae coaptantur.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here then we have the kingly-crowned head, the soldier hand, and above all
the counsellor heart; while the slight differences between John and Shakspere tend
to diminish as we read the hundred odd following pages in which the conception is
worked out in fuller detail. We even notice in a later sentence a suggestion for
Menenius's gibe at the &lsquo;great toe of the assembly&rsquo;: &lsquo;Pedes quidem qui humiliora
exercent officia, appellantur, quorum officia totius rei publicae membra per terram
gradiuntur. His etiam aggregantur multae species lanificii artesque mechanicae,
quae in ligno ferro ere metallisque variis consistunt&rsquo; (Webb, II, 58, section 618 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>),
while the way in which Shakspere's thoughts dwelt upon the symbolism is clearly
shown in the famous passage in <hi rend="italic">Henry V.</hi> about the advised head that defends
<pb n="648"/>

itself at home while the armed hand doth fight abroad: &lsquo;Manus itaque rei publicae
aut armata est aut inermis. Armata quidem est quae castrensem et cruentam
exercet militiam, inermis quae justitiam expedit&rsquo; (Webb, II, 2, section 589 a);
and the Archbishop's speech on the honey-bees, though doubtless directly derived
from Lyly, owes something to the same metaphor. This is not, of course, to
maintain that Shakspere, like Chaucer, had studied John of Salisbury for himself;
all we are here contending for is that, by some process of permeation or other,
such medieval ideas as John expresses in a scholastic manner had reached Shakspere
as part and parcel of the general intellectual equipment of his time. It may well
have been some homily or sermon that formed the channel of transmission&mdash;just
as, in a very probable view, stories like those of the &lsquo;Cock and the Fox&rsquo; came to the
common people and to Chaucer through the sermons of Holkot. Theologians
of the type of Dr Shaw or Vice-Chancellor Perne, preaching on politics as they
so often did in those days, may well have made the conception familiar; nor is it
the habit of preachers, when once they have got hold of a parable, to refrain from
pressing its details.</p>
<p>It may be desirable here to say that I do not believe in a Jewish origin of the idea
of the &lsquo;body politic.&rsquo; In a note on the passage of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> which we are here
considering Aldis Wright remarks that of the ten sephiroth or Intelligences spoken
of in the Kabbala, the first, which is called the crown, is placed in the head, while
the heart is the seat of understanding; and every reader of the Old Testament
knows that &lsquo;men of heart&rsquo; are really men of brain, while fools are spoken of as
destitute of &lsquo;heart.&rsquo; But in the form the idea assumes in the Kabbala there is
every reason to believe that it was the Jews who borrowed from classical authors,
and not <hi rend="italic">vice vers&acirc;.</hi> Though Jewish scholars may have helped to spread such
notions, yet (whatever we may think of the &lsquo;Plutarch&rsquo; on whom John of Salisbury
professes to rely) the ultimate source was certainly classical, and the method of
developing it ecclesiastical.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind, then, that Shakspere's view of the body politic was identical
with this medieval one which we have sketched, we are now able to see a closer
aptness than we might have expected in the speech of King Claudius to Laertes
(<hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> I, ii, 45):
<cit><quote><l part="F">&lsquo;What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,</l>
<l>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</l>
<l>The head is not more native to the heart,</l>
<l>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</l>
<l>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.&rsquo;</l></quote>
<bibl n="shak. ham 1.2">shak. ham 1.2.45</bibl></cit></p>
<p>This is not a series of vague and general metaphors, but symbolism precise, defi-
nite, and technical; as technical, in fact, as one of Donne's medical or scientific
similes. The &lsquo;head&rsquo; is the King as the crowned chief of the State, Claudius him-
self; the &lsquo;heart&rsquo; is the counsellor&mdash;it is indeed Polonius in his capacity as the
Burleigh of Denmark. The next line puts the same thing once more, but with
a slight alteration in the symbolism. Claudius now appears as &lsquo;hand,&rsquo; that is, the
King as soldier, who beareth not the sword in vain; while Polonius, who had just
before been the senator or counsellor, takes now the allied character of the &lsquo;mouth&rsquo;
or orator&mdash;a description which, so far as it can be earned by verbosity, no one,
surely, ever better deserved.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not too fanciful to compare here Milton's famous designation of
the &lsquo;corrupted clergy&rsquo; as &lsquo;blind mouths&rsquo;: gentry who, like Polonius, know how to
<pb n="649"/>
talk, but in their lack of foresight prove very bad sentries. This explanation is at
any rate far less fantastic than that of Ruskin in <hi rend="italic">Sesame and Lilies.</hi> It may
interest Baconians to observe that Bacon's idea of Fortune, as given in his <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi>
is quite different from Shakespere's.</p></quote></cit></div2></div1>

<quote><p> The Character of Martius is truly Dramatic, for his Man-
ners are not only equal but necessary to his Misfortunes. His Pride and Rashness
are what History gives him, but his Modesty and Aversion to Praise I cannot find
in Plutarch, who makes him very well satisfy'd with the Praise given by Cominius.
And indeed it seems something opposite to his Pride, which both in the Play and
History was so signal in him. Our Poet seems fond to lay the Blame on the
People, and everywhere is representing the Inconstancy of the People, but this
is contrary to Truth; for the People have never discover'd that Changeableness
which Princes have done. And Plutarch in the Life of Pyrrhus seems sensible
of this when he says: Thus Kings have no Reason to Condemn the People for
changing for their Interest, who in that do but imitate them, as the great Teachers
of Unfaithfulness and Treachery, holding him the Bravest who makes the least
Account of being an honest Man. And any one that will look over the Roman
History will find such Inconstancy and such a perpetual Changeableness in the
Emperors as cannot be parallel'd in the People of any Time or Country. What
the Greeks or Romans have ever done against any of their fortunate or great
Generals is easily vindicated from a guilty Inconstancy and Ingratitude. For
the fault has always been in the great Men, who swelling in the Pride of their Suc-
cess, have thought in deference to that, that they might and ought to do whatever
they pleas'd; and so often attempted the Ruin of that Liberty themselves for the
Preservation of which their warlike Actions were only valuable. And so it was
their changing their Manners, and not the People, that produc'd their Misfor-
tunes; they lov'd them for Defending their Country and Liberties, but by the same
Principle must hate them when they sought by their Ambition and Pride to sub-
vert them, and this by a Constancy, not variableness, of Principle or Temper.</p>
<p>This is plain in the very Story of this Play, for their Anger was just against
Coriolanus, who thought so well of his own Actions as to believe that ev'n the
Rights, Customs, and Priviledges of his Country were his due for his Valour and
Success. His turning a Traytor to his Country on his Disgrace is a Proof of his
Principle. Camillus, on the contrary, banish'd on far less Occasion or Ground,
brought his Country in Distress Relief against the Gauls so far was he from joining
them.</p>
<p>This Contempt of the People often proceeds from an over Value of our selves,
and that not for our superiour Knowledge, Virtue, Wisdom, etc., but for the good
Fortune of our Birth, which is a Trifle no farther valuable in Truth, than it is
join'd to Courage, Wisdom or Honour; yet what, when blindly valu'd by the
Possessor, sets aside all Thoughts and endeavour to obtain those nobler Advantages.</p>
<p>Our English Poets indeed to flatter Arbitrary Power have too often imitated
Shakespear in this Particular, and preposterously brought the Mob on the Stage
contrary to the Majesty of Tragedy, and the Truth of the Fact. Shakespear has
<pb n="650"/>

here represented, as in <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar,</hi> the Commons of Rome, as if they were the
Rabble of an Irish Village, as senseless, ignorant, silly and cowardly, not remem-
bring that the Citizens of Rome were the Soldiers of the Common-wealth, by
whom they Conquer'd the World; and who in Julius C&aelig;sar's time were at least
as Polite as our Citizens of London; and yet if he had but consulted them, he
wou'd have found it a difficult Matter to have pick'd out such ignorant unlick'd
Cubbs to have fill'd up his Rout.</p>
<p>It is no hard Matter to prove that the People were never in the Wrong but
once, and then they were byass'd by the Priest to choose Barabas and cry out
Crucify.</p>
<p>I have not room here to examine this Point with that Clearness that I might;
nor is it so much to our present Purpose; and yet I presume the Digression is not
so foreign to the Matter as to deserve a judicious Censure.</p>
<p>The Character of Martius is generally preserv'd, and that Love of their Country
which is almost peculiar to Rome and Greece shown in the principal Persons. The
Scene of the Mother, Wife, and Valeria is moving and noble; there are a great
many fine Lines in this Play, tho' the Expression or Diction is sometimes obscure
and puffy.</p></quote></cit></div2>

Brutus and Sicinius make a very pleasing and interesting variety, and the various

<quote><p>Shakespear was one of the greatest Genius's that the
World e'er saw for the Tragick Stage. Tho' he lay under greater Disadvantages
than any of his Successors, yet had he greater and more genuine Beauties than
the best and greatest of them. And what makes the brightest Glory of his Char-
acter, those Beauties were entirely his own, and owing to the Force of his own
Nature; whereas his Faults were owing to his Education, and to the Age that he
liv'd in. One may say of him as they did of Homer, that he had none to imitate,
and is himself inimitable. His Imaginations were often as just, as they were bold
and strong. He had a natural Discretion which never cou'd have been taught him,
and his Judgment was strong and penetrating. He seems to have wanted nothing
but Time and Leisure for Thought to have found out those Rules of which he
appears so ignorant. His Characters are always drawn justly, exactly, graph-
ically, except where he fail'd by not knowing History or the Poetical Art. He
has for the most part more fairly distinguish'd them than any of his Successors
have done, who have falsified them, or confounded them, by making Love the
predominant Quality in all. He had so fine a Talent for touching the Passions,
and they are so lively in him, and so truly in Nature, that they often touch us
more without their due Preparations than those of other Tragick Poets, who have
all the Beauty of Design and all the Advantage of Incidents. His Master-Passion
was Terror, which he has often mov'd so powerfully and so wonderfully that we
may justly conclude that, if he had had the Advantage of Art and Learning, he
would have surpass'd the very best and strongest of the Ancients. His Paintings
are often so beautiful and so lively, so graceful and so powerful, especially where
<pb n="651"/>
he uses them in order to move Terror, that there is nothing perhaps more accom-
plish'd in our English Poetry. His Sentiments for the most part in his best Trag-
edies are noble, generous, easie and natural, and adapted to the Persons who use
them. His Expression is in many Places good and pure after a hundred Years;
simple tho' elevated, graceful tho' bold, and easie tho' strong. He seems to have
been the very Original of our English Tragical Harmony; that is, the Harmony
of Blank Verse, diversifyed often by Dissyllable and Trisyllable Terminations.
For that Diversity distinguishes it from Heroick Harmony, and bringing it nearer
to common Use makes it more proper to gain Attention and more fit for Action
and Dialogue. Such Verse we make when we are writing Prose; we make such Verse
in common Conversation.</p>
<p>If Shakespear had these great Qualities by Nature, what would he not have been
if he had join'd to so happy a Genius Learning and the Poetical Art. For want
of the latter, our Author has sometimes made gross Mistakes in the Characters
which he had drawn from History, against the Equality and Conveniency of
Manners of his Dramatical Persons. Witness Menenius in the following Tragedy,
whom he has made an errant Buffoon, which is a great Absurdity. For he might
as well have imagin'd a grave majestick Jack-Pudding, as a Buffoon in a Roman
Senator. Aufidius the General of the Volscians is shewn a base and a profligate
Villain. He has offended against the Equality of the Manners even in his Hero
himself. For Coriolanus who in the first part of the Tragedy is shewn so open, so
frank, so violent, and so magnanimous, is represented in the latter part by Aufidius,
which is contradicted by no one, a flattering, fawning, cringing, insinuating Traytor.</p>
<p>For want of this Poetical Art, Shakespear has introduced things into his Trag-
edies, which are against the Dignity of that noble Poem, as the Rabble in <hi rend="italic">Julius
C&aelig;sar,</hi> and that in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus;</hi> tho' that in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> offends not only against
the Dignity of Tragedy, but against the Truth of History likewise, and the Customs
of Ancient Rome, and the Majesty of the Roman people, as we shall have occasion
to shew anon.</p>
<p>For want of this Art he has made his Incidents less moving, less surprizing, and
less wonderful. He has been so far from seeking those fine Occasions to move
with which an Action furnish'd according to Art would have furnish'd him that
he seems rather to have industriously avoided them. He makes Coriolanus, upon
his Sentence of Banishment, take his leave of his Wife and his Mother out of sight
of the Audience, and so has purposely, as it were, avoided a great occasion to move.
[Had another critic made a misstatement as apparent as this, Dennis would have
justly censured him.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]</p>
<p>If we are willing to allow that Shakespear, by sticking to the bare Events of
History, has mov'd more than any of his Successors, yet his just Admirers must
confess that, if he had had the Poetical Art, he would have mov'd ten times more.
For 'tis impossible that by a bare Historical Play he could move so much as he
would have done by a Fable.</p>
<p>We find that a Romance entertains the generality of Mankind with more Satis-
faction than History if they read only to be entertain'd; but if they read History
thro' Pride or Ambition, they bring their Passions along with them, and that alters
the case. Nothing is more plain than that even in an Historical Relation some Parts
of it, and some Events, please more than others. And therefore a Man of Judgment,
who sees why they do so, may in forming a Fable, and disposing an Action, please
more than an Historian can do. . . . For 'tis observable that both in a Poetical
Fiction and an Historical Relation those Events are the most entertaining, the most
<pb n="652"/>
surprizing, and the most wonderful, in which Providence most plainly appears. And
'tis for this Reason that the Author of a just Fable must please more than the Writer
of an Historical Relation. The Good must never fail to prosper, and the Bad must
be always punish'd. Otherwise the Incidents, and particularly the Catastrophe
which is the grand Incident, are liable to be imputed rather to Chance than to
Almighty Conduct and to Sovereign Justice. The want of this impartial Dis-
tribution of Justice makes the <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> of Shakespear to be without Moral.
'Tis true indeed Coriolanus is kill'd by those Foreign Enemies with whom he had
openly sided against his Country, which seems to be an Event worthy of Provi-
dence, and would look as if it were contriv'd by infinite Wisdom, and executed by
supreme Justice, to make Coriolanus a dreadful Example to all who lead on Foreign
Enemies to the Invasion of their native Country; if there were not something in
the Fate of the other Characters, which gives occasion to doubt of it, and which
suggests to the Sceptical Reader that this might happen by accident. For Aufidius
the principal Murderer of Coriolanus, who in cold Blood gets him assassinated by
Ruffians, instead of leaving him to the Law of the Country, and the Justice of
the Volscian Senate, and who commits so black a Crime, not by an erroneous
Zeal, or a mistaken publick Spirit, but thro' Jealousy, Envy, and inveterate Malice;
this Assassinator not only survives, and survives unpunish'd, but seems to be
rewarded for so detestable an Action by engrossing all those Honours to himself
which Coriolanus before had shar'd with him. But not only Aufidius, but the
Roman Tribunes, Sicinius and Brutus, appear to me to cry aloud for Poetick Ven-
geance. For they are guilty of two Faults, neither of which ought to go unpunish'd:
The first in procuring the Banishment of Coriolanus. If they were really jealous
that Coriolanus had a Design on their Liberties when he stood for the Consulship,
it was but just that they should give him a Repulse; but to get the Champion and
Defender of their Country banish'd upon a pretended Jealousy was a great deal
too much, and could proceed from nothing but that Hatred and Malice which
they had conceiv'd against him for opposing their Institution. Their second
Fault lay in procuring this Sentence by indirect Methods, by exasperating and
inflaming the People by Artifices and Insinuations, by taking a base Advantage of
the Open-heartedness and Violence of Coriolanus, and by oppressing him with a
Sophistical Argument, that he aim'd at Sovereignty, because he had not delivered
into the Publick Treasury the Spoils which he had taken from the Antiates. As
if a Design of Sovereignty could be reasonably concluded from any one Act; or
any one could think of bringing to pass such a Design, by eternally favouring the
Patricians, and disobliging the Populace. For we need make no doubt but that
it was among the young Patricians that Coriolanus distributed the Spoils which
were taken from the Antiates; whereas nothing but caressing the Populace could
enslave the Roman People, as C&aelig;sar afterwards very well saw and experienc'd.
So that this Injustice of the Tribunes was the original Cause of the Calamity which
afterwards befel their Country, by the Invasion of the Volscians, under the Conduct
of Coriolanus. And yet these Tribunes at the end of the Play, like Aufidius,
remain unpunish'd. . . . The Good and the Bad then perishing promiscuously in the
best of Shakespeare's Tragedies, there can be either none or very weak Instruction
in them: For such promiscuous Events call the Government of Providence into
Question, and by Scepticks and Libertines are resolv'd into Chance. I humbly
conceive therefore that this want of Dramatical Justice in the Tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Corio-
lanus</hi> gave occasion for a just Alteration, and that I was oblig'd to sacrifice to
that Justice Aufidius and the Tribunes, as well as Coriolanus.</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p>Shakespear has in this play
shewn himself well versed in history and state-affairs. <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is a store-house
of political common-places. Any one who studies it may save himself the trouble
of reading Burke's <hi rend="italic">Reflections,</hi> or Paine's <hi rend="italic">Rights of Man,</hi> or the Debates in both
Houses of Parliament since the French Revolution or our own. The arguments
for and against aristocracy or democracy, on the privileges of the few and the
claims of the many, on liberty and slavery, power and the abuse of it, peace and
war, are here very ably handled with the spirit of a poet and the acuteness of a
philosopher. Shakespear himself seems to have had a leaning to the arbitrary
side of the question, perhaps from some feeling of contempt for his own origin;
and to have spared no occasion of bating the rabble. What he says of them is
very true: what he says of their betters is also very true, though he dwells less
upon it. The cause of the people is indeed but little calculated as a subject for
poetry: it admits of rhetoric, which goes into argument and explanation, but
it presents no immediate or distinct images to the mind, &lsquo;no jutting frieze, buttress,
or coigne of vantage&rsquo; for poetry &lsquo;to make its pendant bed and procreant cradle
in.&rsquo; The language of poetry naturally falls in with the language of power. The
imagination is an exaggerating and exclusive faculty: it takes from one thing to
add to another: it accumulates circumstances together to give the greatest possible
effect to a favourite object. . . . Poetry is right-royal. It puts the individual for
the species, the one above the infinite many, might before right. A lion hunting a
flock of sheep or a herd of wild asses is a more poetical object than they; and
we even take part with the lordly beast, because our vanity or some other feeling
makes us disposed to place ourselves in the situation of the strongest party. So
we feel some concern for the poor citizens of Rome when they meet together to
compare their wants and grievances, till Coriolanus comes in and with blows and
big words drives this set of &lsquo;poor rats,&rsquo; this rascal scum, to their homes and beg-
gary before him. There is nothing heroical in a multitude of miserable rogues
not wishing to be starved, or complaining that they are like to be so: but when a
single man comes forward to brave their cries and to make them submit to the
last indignities, from mere pride and self-will, our admiration of his prowess is
immediately converted into contempt for their pusillanimity. The insolence of
power is stronger than the plea of necessity. The tame submission to usurped
authority or even the natural resistance to it has nothing to excite or flatter the
imagination: it is the assumption of a right to insult or oppress others that carries
an imposing air of superiority with it. We had rather be the oppressor than the
oppressed. The love of power in ourselves and the admiration of it in others
are both natural to man: the one makes him a tryant, the other a slave. Wrong
dressed out in pride, pomp, and circumstance has more attraction than abstract
right. Coriolanus complains of the fickleness of the people: yet the instant he
cannot gratify his pride and obstinacy at their expense, he turns his arms against
his country. If his country was not worth defending, why did he build his pride
on its defence? He is a conqueror and a hero; he conquers other countries, and
makes this a plea for enslaving his own; and when he is prevented from doing so,
he leagues with its enemies to destroy his country. He rates the people &lsquo;as if
he were a God to punish, and not a man of their infirmity.&rsquo; He scoffs at one of
their tribunes for maintaining their rights and franchises: &lsquo;Mark you his absolute
shall?&rsquo; not marking his own absolute will to take every thing from them, his
impatience of the slightest opposition to his own pretensions being in proportion to
their arrogance and absurdity. If the great and powerful had the beneficence
<pb n="654"/>
and wisdom of Gods, then all this would have been well: if with a greater knowl-
edge of what is good for the people, they had as great a care for their interest as
they have themselves, if they were seated above the world, sympathising with
the welfare, but not feeling the passions of men, receiving neither good nor hurt
from them, but bestowing their benefits as free gifts on them, they might then rule
over them like another Providence. But this is not the case. Coriolanus is
unwilling that the senate should shew their &lsquo;cares&rsquo; for the people, lest their &lsquo;cares&rsquo;
should be constructed into &lsquo;fears,&rsquo; to the subversion of all due authority; and he is
no sooner disappointed in his schemes to deprive the people not only of the cares
of the state, but of all power to redress themselves, than Volumnia is made madly
to exclaim,
<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,</l>
<l>And occupations perish.&rsquo;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 4.1">shak. cor 4.1.13</bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>This is but natural: it is but natural for a mother to have more regard for her
son than for a whole city; but then the city should be left to take some care of
itself. The care of the state cannot, we here see, be safely entrusted to maternal
affection or to the domestic charities of high life. The great have private feelings
of their own, to which the interests of humanity and justice must courtesy. Their
interests are so far from being the same as those of the community that they are in
direct and necessary opposition to them; their power is at the expense of our weak-
ness; their riches, of our poverty; their pride, of our degradation; their splendour,
of our wretchedness; their tyranny, of our servitude. If they had the superior
knowledge ascribed to them (which they have not) it would only render them so
much more formidable; and from Gods would convert them into Devils. The whole
dramatic moral of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is that those who have little shall have less, and that
those who have much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor;
therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be
treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be
allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved,
oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions,
which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery,
to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that
which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate; to exalt magistrates
into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves
to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a
tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal
hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the
spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc
in the chase, though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that
what men delight to read in books they will put in practice in reality.</p>
<p>One of the most natural traits in this play is the difference of the interest taken
in the success of Coriolanus by his wife and mother. The one is only anxious for
his honour; the other is fearful for his life.</p>
<p>Coriolanus himself is a complete character; his love of reputation, his con-
tempt of popular opinion, his pride and modesty are consequences of each other.
His pride consists in the inflexible sternness of his will; his love of glory is a deter-
mined desire to bear down all opposition, and to extort the admiration both of
friends and foes. His contempt for popular favour, his unwillingness to hear
his own praises, spring from the same source. He cannot contradict the praises
<pb n="655"/>
that are bestowed upon him; therefore he is impatient at hearing them. He would
enforce the good opinion of others by his actions, but does not want their acknowl-
edgments in words.

</p>
<p>His magnanimity is of the same kind. He admires in an enemy that courage
which he honours in himself; he places himself on the hearth of Aufidius with the
same confidence that he would have met him in the field, and feels that by
putting himself in his power he takes from him all temptation for using it against
him.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>This play, which refers us to the third
century of the Republic, is of a very peculiar character, involving in its course a
large intermixture of humorous and political matters. It affords us a picture of
what may be termed a Roman electioneering mob; and the insolence of newly
acquired authority on the part of the tribunes, and the ungovernable licence and
malignant ribaldry of the plebeians, are forcibly but naturally expressed. The
popular anarchy, indeed, is rendered highly diverting through the intervention
of Menenius Agrippa, whose sarcastic wit and shrewd good sense have lent to
these turbulent proceedings a very extraordinary degree of interest and effect.
His &lsquo;pretty tale,&rsquo; as he calls it, of the belly and the members, which he recites to
the people during their mutiny occasioned by the dearth of corn, is a delightful
and improved expansion of the old apologue, originally attributed to Menenius
by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, but taken immediately by Shakspeare from
Plutarch's <hi rend="italic">Life of Coriolanus,</hi> and from Camden's <hi rend="italic">Remains.</hi></p>
<p>The serious and elevated persons of the drama are delineated in colours of
equal, if not superior, strength. The unrivalled military prowess of Coriolanus,
in whose nervous arm &lsquo;Death, that dark spirit,&rsquo; dwelt; the severe sublimity of his
character, his stern and unbending hauteur, and his undisguised contempt of all
that is vulgar, pusillanimous, and base, are brought before us with a raciness and
power of impression, and, notwithstanding a very liberal use both of the senti-
ments and language of his Plutarch, with a freedom of outline which, even in
Shakspeare, may be allowed to excite our astonishment.</p>
<p>The representation of the Character of Coriolanus by Mr. Kemble, which realises
the very conception of the poet, and which in spirit, manner, and costume can
scarcely be deemed susceptible of improvement, has rendered this drama very
popular in our own day.</p>
<p>Among the female characters a very important part is necessarily attached to
the person of Volumnia, the fate of Rome itself depending upon her parental
influence and authority. The poet has accordingly done full justice to the great
qualities which the Cheronean sage has ascribed to this energetic woman; the daring
loftiness of her spirit, her bold and masculine eloquence, and, above all, her patri-
otic devotion, being marked by the most spirited and vigorous touches of his
pencil.</p>
<p>The numerous vicissitudes in the story; its rapidity of action; its contrast of
character; the splendid vigour of its serious, and the satirical sharpness and relish
of its more familiar scenes, together with the animation which prevails throughout
all its parts, have conferred on this play, both in the closet and on the stage, a
remarkable degree of attraction.</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p>The leading idea of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>&mdash;the pivot upon
which all the action turns, the key to the bitterness of factious hatred which
runs through the whole drama&mdash;is the contest for power between the patricians
and plebeians. This is a broad principle, assuming various modifications in
various states of society, but very slightly varied in its foundations and its results.
He that truly works out the exhibition of this principle must paint men, let the
scene be the Rome of the first Tribunes or the Venice of the last Doges. With the
very slightest changes of accessories the principle stands for the contests between
aristocracy and democracy, in any country or in any age, under a republic or a
monarchy. The historical truth and the philosophical principle which Shakspere
has embodied in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> are universal. But suppose he had possessed the
means of treating the subject with what some would call historical accuracy; had
learnt that Plutarch, in the story of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> was probably dealing only with a
legend; that, if the story is to be received as true, it belongs to a later period; that
in this later period there were very nice shades of difference between the classes
composing the population of Rome; that the balance of power was a much more
complex thing than he found in the narrative of Plutarch; further, suppose that,
proud of this learning, he had made the universal principle of the plebeian and
patrician hostility subsidiary to an exact display of it, according to the conjectures
which modern industry and acuteness have brought to bear on the subject. It is
evident, we think, that he would have been betrayed into a false principle of art,
and would necessarily have drawn Roman shadows instead of vital and enduring
men. As it is, he has drawn men so vividly&mdash;under such permanent relations to
each other&mdash;with such universal manifestations of character, that some persons
of strong political feelings have been ready to complain, according to their several
creeds, either that his plebeians are too brutal or his patricians too haughty. A
polite democracy, a humane oligarchy, would be better.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p><hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> must have been after 1605, according to Malone,
from the resemblance, in the speech of Menenius to the people, to certain passages
in Camden's <hi rend="italic">Remains.</hi></p>
<p>He is evidently stiffened by writing from a history. His art, as he says in his son-
nets, is &lsquo;made tongue-tied by authority.&rsquo; The first part of the mother's speech might
almost have been another poet's; though the other part of it, which is separated,
could not. He thought that he was bound to the words which he found in the
book, and had only to make verse of it. He is also stiffened by having to write
on a high political subject. But all this operates quite differently from what it
does in his plays on the history of England, partly from falling upon a different
time of his life, partly because the manners are not English. Instead of thinning
off his multitude of ideas, the constraint of the subject seems only to increase the
demand for a crowd and complication of them. Ideas, quite as much ratio-
cinative as imaginative, though there are passages that approach to rant. The
subject took his mind in this direction rather than that of simple feeling. But
the four lines on Valeria would be enough to show that he has still the same sweet-
ness of character. The love of thought and knowledge, which he seems always to
have possessed, must have immensely increased the stores of his mind, and the
materials, either for good or bad illustration, as he lived longer, and in so very
learned an age. Perhaps the example of Jonson led him to require of himself more
of dry thought (yet Jonson does not think deeply, as he does). In this play there
is a good deal of character and prodigious spirit in many places, but which seems
<pb n="657"/>
obstructed and kept down by the loaded state of mind I have mentioned, and by
the exceedingly over-forced system of metre. With all the interest of the story,
it is, to me, an uninviting and unremembered play. I speak of the serious passages
in verse except the last scene of the killing. The scenes of the mob are excessively
natural and spirited, and are among those I have always found to give that im-
pression of reality, when acted, which the works of no other writer can do.</p>
<p>It is a much better play, no doubt, than <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens,</hi> which is something
of the same class; or <hi rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida,</hi> which is not. There is a great deal
more in it. It is hard; every sentence, almost, asks some pains to take in its
meaning wholly.</p>
<p>The verse of this play is somewhat like that of <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII.,</hi> but the matter in
<hi rend="italic">Henry VIII.</hi> is thin in comparison, and the meaning, consequently, clear; and it
is far more prosaic and matter-of-fact. Here we have the fourth style completely.</p>
<p>The speeches, too, break and fit together regularly, and double endings are
frequent.</p>
<p>The poetry and the thoughts in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> arise out of the business of the scene;
there are not many excursive passages, and those are mostly of feeling, not reasoning or imagery.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>This is the tragedy. Coriolanus is first starved
and impoverished by an ideal from which he has no escape, an ideal which as in
duty bound he satisfies, and more than satisfies: and then he is annihilated by it.
And the cruellest of the tragedy is this, that he possesses in himself in high per-
fection that very capacity&mdash;namely, of sympathy&mdash;which the ideal proscribes,
the obedient renunciation of which is his ruin. Consider his beautiful love and
reverence for &lsquo;the most noble mother of the world&rsquo;&mdash;Volumnia, the splendid
Patrician woman without sympathy, who &lsquo;framed&rsquo; him. Three times in the
Play she, for a purpose, untightens the strain of his nature; and he, for his love
for her, submits. Or his still more beautiful and tender love for his wife Virgilia,
Patrician indeed, but so unlike the type&mdash;&lsquo;best of his flesh,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Gracious silence,&rsquo;
whose kiss is sweeter to him than revenge. Or, again, his friendship for Menenius,
the old man who worships him, whose heart is cracked by his enforced unkindness.
How alien all this is from the mere Patrician mould of selfish isolation into which
his nature is, for the rest, compressed. But it may be urged that, had his nature
been truly generous, he would have practically recoiled from such excesses of
insolence and of revenge&mdash;however logically forced upon him by the triple com-
bination of aggressive Plebeians, narrow Patrician ideal, and boiling pent-up energy
of soul. Can we not, on the contrary, almost put ourselves at his standpoint and
sympathize with him? Are not the Tribunes ignoble, malevolent, treacherous,
mean? Are not the people cowardly, foolish, fickle, without an ideal, led through
the nose by demagogues? He seems not to have believed in the starvation and
misery of the commons when they clamoured for corn; and it is certain that the
<pb n="658"/>
idea of patriotism, in the largest sense, was impossible to him. The Patricians
were, to him, his countrymen; and the Plebeians, since the institution of the
Tribunate, his countrymen's worst enemies. This misconception was at the root
of the mischief; but his sin, his treason, was not that he was ready to fight against
his country, but that he was ready to involve his friends in one common destruction
with his foes.</p>
<p>Compare Coriolanus, lastly, with Aufidius. The hearts of both men are set
upon glory. Both men are cruelly revengeful. Aufidius too is noble sometimes,
but only sometimes. He can be envious; and this (in spite of his accusation of
himself, &lsquo;I sin in envying his nobility,&rsquo; and the slander of the Tribunes, that he
submits to be commanded by Cominius only that he may have the honours for
himself and let the faults be charged to his superior), Coriolanus cannot be. And,
what is most unlike the true Coriolanus, the Volscian can conceal a purpose, cal-
culate an opportunity, spring treacherously upon an unsuspecting foe. He has,
nevertheless, bursts of nobleness. His welcome of Coriolanus (the most eloquent
passage in the Play) is the expression of a real, though transient, enthusiasm.</p>
<p>What is the dramatic fitness, dramatic teaching, of the death of Coriolanus by
the hand of Aufidius? Is it not that Coriolanus is in this most false to himself&mdash;
that, to effect his revenge, he allies himself with, so debases himself to the level of,
a meaner nature? How unlike him, how like Aufidius, the silence as to his pur-
pose of revenge in which he parts from his friends when he leaves Rome; the silence
of his journey to Antium; and, most of all, the cynical cold speech which breaks
the silence as he passes through the streets of Antium to the house of Aufidius.
In all this he is dishonest, unnatural; revenge has warped the straightness of his
soul. Had he been true to his nature, he would have been still the foe of Aufidius,
and, as a foe, he leads a life charmed against all possible assaults. It is as if his
magnificent honesty had been the panoply of the man, and that here he discovers
for the first time a vulnerable point. It seems that his nobleness, exaggerated by
all the circumstances of his life&mdash;the milk he has sucked, the very air he has
breathed&mdash;gives away at last and cracks under the over-strain of the conflict with
the Tribunes; and though, when the strain has abated, the man becomes natural
again, himself again, the fatal crack remains, and admits the knife of the assassin.</p>
<p>We have seen how stormy excesses of passion, through the shock and breach of
the sacred ties of country and of blood, avenge themselves&mdash;in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> as in
<hi rend="italic">Lear</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Macbeth.</hi> We do not know what it was that, in this latest period of
his works, so constantly attracted Shakspere to the theme of impiety, of un-
natural hate and ingratitude and treason. Events may to some extent have shaped
his thoughts. It has been suggested that <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi> was written not without
reference to the rebellion of the Earl of Essex. And we may suppose that in
<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> Shakspere intended a twofold warning, to the pride of James and to
the gathering resistance of the Commons. The first of the Stuart kings had lost
no time in propounding his theory of kingship. From the first meeting of his first
parliament to its dissolution in this year 1610, there were continual bickerings
between King and Commons. &lsquo;His command upon our allegiance,&rsquo; they said,
&lsquo;is like the roaring of a lion.&rsquo; The straining of the prerogative and the doctrine
of the duty of passive obedience were met by statements of grievances, by the
assertion of the privileges of parliament, and in February of this year by a Re-
monstrance against illegal impositions.</p>
<p>But the lesson of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> (standing as it does among the plays of this period)
is less political than moral. Between the haughtiness of the aristocrat and the
<pb n="659"/>
clamour of the demagogue there is little to choose: both are excess. Man is
violent, but the Erinys of violence is sure: in moderation, not excess, is strength.</p>
<p>We do not find ideals, political or moral, upon the stage of Shakspere. All that
moves there is real. But it is there as in the life which is there portrayed: those
who have eyes to see can discern, through the distempered atmosphere of the actual,
the presence of an all-controlling law. Violence may drown the voice of reason and
of conscience; but reason and conscience assert themselves at last. Disorder
yields to order: and the anarchic impulses of men obey the calm supremacy of right.</p>
<p>For Shakspere, like Sophocles, is a harmonist of discords: himself harmonious,
whole, he sees the whole, and not the part, and sees that all is good.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> The tragedy is not heard of at
all through any notice or allusion made during the author's life; in fact, w&lt;*&gt; have
no contemporary note of reference to it whatever, save in the elegy on Richard
Burbadge, where we learn that the hero's part was sustained by that celebrated
actor. So that we are left without any external evidence as to the date of the
writing. Nor does the piece itself contain a traceable vestige of allusion to any
known contemporary events; such, for instance, as that to the new creation of
baronets in  <hi rend="italic">Othello.</hi> Our only argument, therefore, as regards the time of com-
position lies in marks of style, use of language, and complexion of imagery and
thought; in all which respects it clearly falls among the very latest of the Poet's
writing. Certainly no play of the series surpasses it, and very few, if any, equal
it, in boldness of metaphor, in autocratic prerogative of expression, or in passages
marked by an overcrowding of matter or an overcompression of language. The
strength of civil wisdom, also, the searching anatomy of public characters and
motives, the wide and firm grasp of social and political questions, in short, the
whole moral and intellectual climate of the piece, all concur with the former notes
in marking it off to the Poet's highest maturity of thought and power. There-
withal I hold it to be among his greatest triumphs in organization: I cannot point
out, I believe no one has pointed out, a single instance where the parts might have
been better ordered for the proper effect of the whole; while the interest never once
flags or falters, nor suffers any break or diversion, from the beginning to the end;
rather say, it holds on with ever-increasing force throughout, and draws all the
details into its current; so that the unity of impression is literally perfect. In this
great point of dramatic architecture I think it bears the palm clean away from
both the other Roman tragedies; and indeed I am not sure but it should be set
down as the peer of <hi rend="italic">Othello, Macbeth,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">King Lear.</hi></p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p><hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi> Another Roman
play from Plutarch; but how different in tone and colour from the last! An interval
of 520 years separates the deaths of the two heroes (Coriolanus's was after 489
B. C.; Antony's, 30 A. D.). Antony lived in the decay of public spirit, the growth
of luxury in Rome, and after his death Augustus became its first Emperor. Corio-
lanus lived in Rome's early austere days, just when she'd driven the lustful Tarquin
from his throne, and establisht the Republic. And it was in the great battle
against Tarquin endeavouring to recover the throne, that Coriolanus won his first
garland of oak. But it is rather in the heroines than the heroes that the contrast
of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is felt. Against the shifting colours of the
kaleidoscope of Cleopatra's whims and moods, against the hail and storm of her
passions, the lurid glow of her lust, the fierce lightning of her wrath, rises the pure
<pb n="660"/>
white figure of Volumnia, clad in the dignity of Honour and Patriotism, the grand-
est woman in Shakspere, the embodiment of all the virtues that made the noble
Roman lady. It is the heaven of Italy beside the hell of Egypt. And from mothers
like Volumnia came the men who conquered the known world, and have left their
mark for ever on the nations of Europe. Read her lines in their beautiful rhythmic
prose, &lsquo;When yet &verbar; he was but &verbar; tender-bodied, &verbar; and the on &verbar; ly son &verbar; of my
womb. &verbar; I &verbar; was pleased &verbar; to let him &verbar; seek danger &verbar; where &verbar; he was like &verbar; to find
fame. &verbar; Had I &verbar; a doz &verbar; en sons, &verbar; each in &verbar; my love &verbar; alike. &verbar; I had rather &verbar; had
eleven &verbar; die nobly &verbar; for their country, &verbar; than one &verbar; volup &verbar; tuously &verbar; surfeit &verbar; out
of &verbar; action.&rsquo; See her overcome her mother's righteous indignation against her
townsmen's injustice to her gallant son; see her on her knees to that son, for her
country's sake, pleading to him for mercy to her native land, appealing to him in
words that all Shakspere's last plays echo and re-echo to us: &lsquo;Think'st thou it
honourable, for a noble man, still to remember wrongs?&rsquo; See her win her happy
victory, and then return with welcome into Rome, its life; and then acknowledge
that no grander, nobler woman, was ever created by Shakspere's art.</p>
<p>Her one fault, her son tells us of, her scorn of the common folk. And as his
character was moulded on hers, this fault he shared, but he wilfully greatend it,
while his pride and self-love stopt his reaching the height of his mother's patriot-
ism. &lsquo;Flower of warriors&rsquo; as he is, &lsquo;his nature (on one side) too noble for this
world,&rsquo; bravest of the brave, generous in his gifts, his pride&mdash;as well of person as
of birth&mdash;flaws and ruins the jewel of his renown. Treated with ingratitude&mdash;
base and outrageous though in his case it was&mdash;he cannot put his country above
himself. As Hotspur would third England, so Coriolanus would destroy Rome.
His grip is on her throat when his wife Virgilia, mov'd by the gods, stirs his
mother to appeal to him. They are joind by Valeria&mdash;
<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle</l>

<l>And hangs on Dian's temple,&rsquo;&mdash;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 5.3">shak. cor 5.3.65</bibl></cit>

and they visit that Volscian camp. Coriolanus thought he was above nature,
that he could hear them unmoved. But mother, wife, and boy prevail. Corio-
lanus is himself again, and takes death, as he should, from the hand of his country's
foe, while his dear ones, unlike Portia, Cordelia, live on in Rome. The ingratitude
of the Roman citizens, the cursings of them by Coriolanus, prepare us for the bitterer
curses of the next play of this Group, [<hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi>].</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p><hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is essentially a drama of Political Parties. Internal
dissension, through partisan organizations, is shown in a variety of forms; also,
other elements, as foreign war and the domestic relation, intermingle in the action
and diversify its incidents and coloring. Moreover, the warring principles of the
two parties are aristocracy and democracy&mdash;the conflict which has always in
History been most prolific of political strife. The main characters are graded
according to their partisan bias and intensity, for the essence of the conflict is
party versus country. Finally, the heroic figure of the drama is a person who
cannot subordinate his hatred against a party to his love for his country. Great
as is Coriolanus, Rome must get rid of him, and all like him, before she can con-
quer the world.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the action exhibits two distinct movements&mdash;the one of
which terminates in the banishment of the hero, the other in his death. Coriolanus
<pb n="661"/>
is portrayed as the great defender of his country, but also as the greater enemy
of the plebeians; partisan rancor leads to his expulsion&mdash;to his separation from
Family and State. Herein both sides commit wrong. Such is the first movement.
The second movement shows Coriolanus passing over to the enemies of his coun-
try, in order to ruin it and thereby ruin the opposite party. Patriotism is subor-
dinate to partisan hate; even attachment to his own class cannot outweigh his
desire for revenge. His nation and his order, therefore, cannot mediate his
hostility to a party, but his family can, though at the cost of the life of himself,
one of its members.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the two threads which run through the whole play are the
political and domestic, in their manifold relation and interaction. The political
thread is shown in both its internal and external manifestations, namely, in partisan
dissension and in foreign war; while the domestic thread&mdash;the Family&mdash;has its
various sides represented in the mother, wife, husband, son, father, neighbor, and
friend.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>I cannot but think that enough at least of
time has been spent if not wasted by able and even by eminent men on examination
of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> with regard to its political aspect or bearing upon social questions.
It is from first to last, for all its turmoil of battle and clamour of contentious
factions, rather a private and domestic than a public or historical tragedy. As in
<hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi> the family had been so wholly subordinated to the state, and all
personal interests so utterly dominated by the preponderance of national duties,
that even the sweet and sublime figure of Portia passing in her &lsquo;awful loveliness&rsquo;
was but as a profile half caught in the background of an episode, so here on the
contrary the whole force of the final impression is not that of a conflict between
patrician and plebeian, but solely that of a match of passions played out for life
and death between a mother and a son. The partisans of oligarchic or demo-
cratic systems may wrangle at their will over the supposed evidences of Shake-
speare's prejudice against this creed and prepossession in favour of that. A third
bystander may rejoice in the proof thus established of his impartial indifference
towards either; it is all nothing to the real point in hand. The subject of the whole
play is not the exile's revolt, the rebel's repentance, or the traitor's reward, but
above all it is the son's tragedy. The inscription on the plinth of this tragic statue
is simply to Volumnia Victrix.</p>
<p>A loftier or a more perfect piece of man's work was never done in all the world
than this tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus;</hi> the one fit and crowning epithet for its companion
or successor is that bestowed by Coleridge&mdash;&lsquo;the most wonderful.&rsquo;</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>All of the later tragedies may
be called tragedies of passion, but not all of them display these extreme forms of
evil. Neither of the last two does so. Antony and Coriolanus are, from one
point of view, victims of passion; but the passion that ruins Antony also exalts
him, he touches the infinite in it; and the pride and self-will of Coriolanus, though
terrible in bulk, are scarcely so in quality; there is nothing base in them, and the
huge creature whom they destroy is a noble, even a lovable being. Nor does
either of these dramas, though the earlier depicts a corrupt civilisation, include
even among the minor characters anyone who can be called villainous or horrible.
Consider, finally, the impression left on us at the close of each. It is remarkable
that this impression, though very strong, can scarcely be called purely tragic; or,
<pb n="662"/>
if we call it so, at least the feeling of reconciliation which mingles with the obviously
tragic emotions is here exceptionally well-marked. The death of Antony, it will
be remembered, comes before the opening of the Fifth Act. The death of Cleo-
patra, which closes the play, is greeted by the reader with sympathy and admira-
tion, even with exultation at the thought that she has foiled Octavius; and these
feelings are heightened by the deaths of Charmian and Iras, heroically faithful to
their mistress, as Emilia was to hers. In <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> the feeling of reconciliation
is even stronger. The whole interest towards the close has been concentrated on
the question whether the hero will persist in his revengeful design of storming
and burning his native city, or whether better feelings will at last overpower his
resentment and pride. He stands on the edge of a crime beside which, at least
in outward dreadfulness, the slaughter of an individual looks insignificant. And
when, at the sound of his mother's voice and the sight of his wife and child, nature
asserts itself and he gives way, although we know he will lose his life, we care little
for that; he has saved his soul. Our relief, and our exultation in the power of
goodness, are so great that the actual catastrophe which follows and mingles sad-
ness with these feelings leaves them but little diminished, and as we close the
book we feel, it seems to me, more as we do at the close of <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline</hi> than as we do
at the close of <hi rend="italic">Othello.</hi> In saying this I do not in the least mean to criticise <hi rend="italic">Corio-
lanus.</hi> It is a much nobler play as it stands than it would have been if Shakespeare
had made the hero persist, and we had seen him amid the flaming ruins of Rome,
awaking suddenly to the enormity of his deed and taking vengeance on himself;
but that would surely have been an ending more strictly tragic than the close of
Shakespeare's play. Whether this close was simply due to his unwillingness to
contradict his historical authority on a point of such magnitude we need not ask.
In any case <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is, in more than an outward sense, the end of his tragic
period. It marks the transition to his latest works, in which the powers of repent-
ance and forgiveness charm to rest the tempest raised by error and guilt.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p><hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is beyond doubt among the latest
of Shakespeare's tragedies; there is some reason for thinking it the last. Like
all those that succeeded <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi> it is a tragedy of vehement passion; and in none
of them are more striking revolutions of fortune displayed. It is full of power,
and almost every one feels it to be a noble work. We may say of it, as of its hero,
that, if not one of Shakespeare's greatest creations, it is certainly one of his biggest.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is scarcely popular. It is seldom acted, and perhaps no reader
ever called it his favourite play. Indeed, except for educational purposes, I
suppose it is, after <hi rend="italic">Timon,</hi> the least generally read of the tragedies. Even the
critic who feels bound to rank it above <hi rend="italic">Romeo and Juliet,</hi> and even above <hi rend="italic">Julius
C&aelig;sar,</hi> may add that he prefers those dramas all the same; and if he ignores his
personal preferences, still we do not find him asking whether it is not the equal of
the four great tragedies. He may feel this doubt as to <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra,</hi> but
not as to <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi></p>
<p>The question why this should be so will at once tell us something about the
drama. We cannot say that it shows any decline in Shakespeare's powers, though
in parts it may show slackness in their use. It has defects, some of which are due
to the historical material; but all the tragedies have defects, and the material of
<hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> was even more troublesome. There is no love-story; but
then there is none in <hi rend="italic">Macbeth,</hi> and next to none in <hi rend="italic">King Lear.</hi> Thanks in part
to the badness of the Folio text, the reader is impeded by obscurities of language
<pb n="663"/>
and irritated by the mangling of Shakespeare's metre; yet these annoyances would
not much diminish the effect of <hi rend="italic">Othello.</hi> It may seem a more serious obstacle
that the hero's faults are repellent and chill our sympathy; but Macbeth, to say
nothing of his murders, is a much less noble being than Coriolanus. All this
doubtless goes for something; but there must be some further reason why this
drama stands apart from the four great tragedies and <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra.</hi> And
one main reason seems to be this. Shakespeare could construe the store he found
only by conceiving the hero's character in a certain way; and he had to set the whole
drama in tune with that conception. In this he was, no doubt, perfectly right;
but he closed the door on certain effects, in the absence of which his whole power
in tragedy could not be displayed. He had to be content with something less, or
rather with something else; and so have we.</p>
<p>Dr Johnson observes that &lsquo;the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is one of the most amusing
of our author's performances.&rsquo; By &lsquo;amusing&rsquo; he did not mean &lsquo;mirth-provoking&rsquo;;
he meant that in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> a lively interest is excited and sustained by the variety
of the events and characters; and this is true. But we may add that the play
contains a good deal that is amusing in the current sense of the word. When the
people appear as individuals they are frequently more or less comical. Shakespeare
always enjoyed the inconsequence of the uneducated mind, and its tendency to
express a sound meaning in an absurd form. Again, the talk of the servants
with one another and with the muffled hero, and the conversation of the sentinels
with Menenius, are amusing. There is a touch of comedy in the contrast between
Volumnia and Virgilia when we see them on occasions not too serious. And then,
not only at the beginning, as in Plutarch, but throughout the story we meet with
that pleasant and wise old gentleman Menenius, whose humour tells him how to
keep the peace while he gains his point, and to say without offence what the hero
cannot say without raising a storm. Perhaps no one else in the play is regarded
from beginning to end with such unmingled approval, and this is not lessened
when the failure of his embassy to Coriolanus makes him the subject as well as
the author of mirth. If we regard the drama from this point of view we find that
it differs from almost all the tragedies, though it has a certain likeness to <hi rend="italic">Antony
and Cleopatra.</hi> What is amusing in it is, for the most part, simply amusing, and
has no tragic tinge. It is not like the gibes of Hamlet at Polonius, or the jokes of
the clown who, we remember, is digging Ophelia's grave, or that humour of Iago
which for us is full of menace; and who could dream of comparing it with the
jesting of Lear's fool? Even that Shakespearean audacity, the interruption of
Volumnia's speech by the hero's little son, makes one laugh almost without reserve.
And all this helps to produce the characteristic tone of this tragedy.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Certainly <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is not meant to be a constitutional
manifesto; probably it does not, even at unawares, idealise a contemporary dis-
pute; it is hardly likely that Shakespeare so much as intrudes conscious allusions
to the questions then at issue. And this on account not only of the particular
opinions attributed to him, but, much more, of his usual practice in poetic creation.
Do any of these alleged incentives in the circumstances, public or private, of his
life go far to explain his attraction to a story and selection of it, its power over him
and his power over it? Doubtless in realising the subject that took his fancy, he
would draw on the stores of his experience as well as his imagination. In dealing
with the tragedy of a proud and unpopular hero of antiquity, very possibly he
would be helped by what he knew of the tragedy of a proud and unpopular worthy
<pb n="664"/>
of his own time. In dealing with the influence of a mother and the reverence of
a son, very probably the memories of his own home would hover before his mind.
In dealing with the plebeians and patricians of Rome, he would inevitably fill in
the details from his knowledge of the burgesses and nobles of England, and he
might get hints for his picture of the by-gone struggle, from the struggle that he
himself could watch. But it is the story of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> that comes first and that
absorbs all such material into itself, just as the seed in its growth assimilates
nourishment from the earth and sunshine and rain. These things are not the seed.
The experiences are utilised in the interest of the play; the play is not utilised in
the interest of the experiences.</p>
<p>It is particularly important to emphasise this in view of the circumstance that
<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> has often been regarded as a drama of principles rather than of char-
acter, even by those who refrain from reading into it any particular reference.
But Shakespeare's supreme preoccupation is always with his fable, which explains,
and is explained by, human nature in action. He does not set out to commend or
censure or examine a precept or a theory or a doctrine. Of course the life of men
is concerned with such matters, and he could not exclude them without being untrue
to his aim. Thus, to take the most obvious example, it is impossible to treat of
character with a total omission of ethical considerations, since character is con-
nected with conduct, and conduct has its ethical aspect; and, indeed, success in
getting to the truth of character depends very much on the keenness of the moral
insight. It is very largely Shakespeare's moral insight that gives him his unrivalled
position among the interpreters of men; and we may, if we like, derive any number
of improving lessons from his works. But he is an artist, not a moralist; and he
wrote for the story, not for the moral. Just in the same way an architect seeks to
design a beautiful or convenient building, not to illustrate mechanical laws.
Nevertheless, in proportion as these are neglected, the building will not rise or
will not last; and if they are obeyed, however unconsciously, the illustration of
them will be provided. In Charlotte Bronte's <hi rend="italic">Shirley,</hi> when Caroline gives Robert
Moore this very play to read, he asks, &lsquo;Is it to operate like a sermon?&rsquo; And she
answers: &lsquo;It is to stir you; to give you new sensations. It is to make you feel
life strongly&rsquo; (that is the main thing, and then comes the indirect consequence),
&lsquo;not only your virtues, but your vicious perverse points.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now just as in all Shakespeare's dramas, though or rather because they are
personal, the ethical considerations cannot be excluded; so in a drama that moves
through a constitutional crisis, though or rather because it, too, is personal,
political considerations cannot be excluded. They are there, though it is on the
second plane. And just as his general delineation of character would be unsatis-
factory if his moral insight were at fault, so his delineation of the characters that
play their part in this history would be unsatisfactory if his political insight were
at fault. He is not necessarily bound to appreciate correctly the conditions that
prevailed in reality or by report: that is required only for historical accuracy or
fidelity to tradition. But he is bound to appreciate the conditions as he imagines
them, and not to violate in his treatment of them the principles that underlie all
political society.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>It has been supposed by some that in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>
the leading thought of the poet is a purely political one, and that we have here
an exposition of Shakespeare's political faith. This appears to be a complete
inversion of his method. It is true, no doubt, that in plays which turn upon political 
<pb n="665"/>
issues Shakespeare's leanings may in some measure be seen, and that in
<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> those leanings are not towards democracy. But that he here or any-
where preached a political doctrine I disbelieve as entirely as I disbelieve that
he ever preached a moral doctrine. A moral is of course to be found in all stories
of human action. But it is there because the poet taking certain characters and
certain incidents, whether from history, fiction, or his own imagination, shows us
dramatically how those characters would act amidst those incidents; not because
he has chosen those characters and incidents to illustrate a particular theory
whether of ethics or of politics. In the present instance history is at hand with an
outline of striking incidents, and characters strong in their individuality&mdash;in
other words, with a subject eminently capable of dramatic handling. Shakespeare's
tribunes are the tribunes of Plutarch, his hero Plutarch's hero, but with their souls
laid bare, the working of their minds manifested in words as in actions. The
play has, in fact, nothing more of set political purpose than, say, <hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi> or
<hi rend="italic">Cymbeline. . . .</hi> A great though far from flawless soul is brought in contact with
mighty events, and the necessary results of position, nature, and training develop
themselves.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p><hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is, if not
one of the greatest, one of the most masterly of Shakespeare's plays. If it does not
hold all the spiritual significance of any of the three great tragedies, if it has not
the profound emotional appeal of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar,</hi> it in-
dubitably belongs to the same period of serene mastery of mind and expression.
French critics continually, and English critics occasionally&mdash;these last improperly
obeisant before the prestige of French criticism&mdash;have said that <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is
Shakespeare's most perfect work of art. While we deplore their language, we
understand their meaning. <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is a magnificent example of creative con-
trol. Its design is, as Mr Walter Sickert has well said of Poussin's painting,
&lsquo;marshalled.&rsquo; Its economy, its swiftness, its solidity, its astonishing clarity and
pregnancy of language are not only satisfying and exhilarating in themselves,
but they have a peculiar and profound appropriateness to the martial argument.
Just as the looser texture of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> seems to be the inevitable gar-
ment of the decaying soldiership of Antony, so the exact and unrelenting pattern
of Coriolanus seems essential to the unfaltering decision and the unswerving success
of the earlier Roman general. The play marches onward like a legion in the days
when Roman soldiers were Romans still.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is this quality of Roman relentlessness and inevitability which has
made it unsympathetic to the general English taste, for among us it is surely the
least popular of Shakespeare's great plays. In France, on the contrary, it is said
to be the most popular; probably not for the same reason. Beyond the fact that
Coriolanus is a familiar and traditional hero of the French theatre, the concen-
trated and controlled dramatic action which distinguishes Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>
from his other great dramas appeals directly to the French palate. Since, however,
this only means that <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is an unusually well-constructed play, it cannot
account for the general reluctance of English people to admit it to their affections.
The reason, one imagines, is that it is too Roman. An English audience, and
English readers for that matter, like to surrender themselves to their heroes.
They can idolise Brutus as an Eloquent Hampden, and sympathise with an Antony
lost in the embraces of his serpent of old Nile. A martyr for political liberty, a
martyr for love, these are intimate and comprehensible to us; but a martyr to the
<pb n="666"/>
aristocratic idea is not. He is an alien; there is too much of the British constitution
in our blood for him to warm it.</p>
<p>In other and more familiar terms Coriolanus is an unsympathetic hero, and all
the characters of the play, save one, Virgilia, strike chill upon the general heart.
Volumnia is altogether too much like that forbidding Spartan mother who
haunted our schooldays with her grim farewell: &lsquo;Return with your shield or upon
it&rsquo;; Menenius is too cynical, too worldy-wise to move us humanly in his discom-
fiture; Brutus and Sicinius arouse neither sympathy nor disdain; and the emotion
we feel at the knightly generosity of Aufidius is dashed too soon by his confession
that, if he cannot overthrow Coriolanus by fair means, he will by foul. Coriolanus
himself we cannot like, any more than a schoolboy can like Themistocles. One
may despise one's country, one may hate one's country, but one may not lead an
enemy against her. These are primitive ethics, no doubt, but they are profound,
and though they may be alien to &aelig;sthetic criticism, they have their roots deep in
the human heart. The writer who ignores them deliberately imperils the universal-
ity of his appeal.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>There are, roughly, three periods or stages in the develop-
ment of Shakespearean drama. A period before the great inspiration, the period
when it was in full force, and a period when it was on the wane or had even ceased.
The first period contains, for instance, <hi rend="italic">Love's Labour's Lost, The Two Gentlemen,
The Comedy of Errors.</hi> These are youthful productions, not very great, but not
distasteful; and, the critics seem agreed, not beyond the powers of other dramatists.
Of the period of decline or even cessation I should select as the most important
instance <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus. Coriolanus</hi> is a play on the grand scale. It is one of the
great plays, a great tragedy, or it is nothing. Now what do we look for in a great
play by the greatest of poets? One would say, poetry: poetical imagination,
poetical passion, poetical beauty. From beginning to end of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> there is
none of these. From the poet of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> we look for exalted sentiment. In
<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> we find its unpleasant opposite; there is more than defective taste,
there is perverted moral sense. There is, morally, as wide a gulf between the char-
acter of Coriolanus, as there is, intellectually, between the wit of Falstaff and the
malapropisms of Dogberry and Verges. Hamlet is what we call a gentlemen, if
ever there was one, Coriolanus is not. I take it that one indelible mark of the
man we call a gentlemen is that he never too obviously asserts himself. Hamlet
is every whit as brave as Coriolanus; but he is not continually telling us how brave
he is. We infer it from his actions, not from his proclamations. Coriolanus is
blatant in his self-glorification. If we could imagine Pistol not a coward, he would
be just such another.</p>
<p>Coriolanus has absolutely no good attribute except physical courage, which he
shares with most men and many animals. It is only because the defect of it is
such an object of contempt, that its possession is so much and so generally ap-
plauded. In her own way that horrible woman, Volumnia, is just as repulsive&mdash;
fit mother of such a son. Indeed if we would mitigate our judgment of Coriolanus
it would be on the ground of his unfortunate maternal parentage; we might con-
jecture whence he derived his unbridled rant. Lady Macbeth we always respect.
We even, such is the magic of the great play, sympathise with her, in a way. For
Volumnia we have neither sympathy nor respect. She sets every nerve on edge.
She and her congenial friend, Valeria, gloating over a little wretch of a boy (son to
Coriolanus), tearing a butterfly to pieces in a fit of passion, makes a picture that,
<pb n="667"/>
in this strange, decadent mood, Shakespeare seems to ask us to admire; but these
mock-heroic women are in shocking contrast with other Shakespearean heroines.
Even Lady Macbeth is murderous with a difference; she is not bloodthirsty. No
horror will deter her; but she does not love horrors. These women do.</p>
<p>In order to extol Coriolanus Shakespeare defames the commons. To make the
Romans cowards is a libel, and a ridiculous libel at that. They were not even
fools, but, as a nation, courage they could not possibly have lacked. The whole
picture is about as incongruous and untrue to life as perverted sympathy can make
it; and it is as bad in art as in morals.</p>
<p>For with this perversion of moral sense perversion of style goes here hand in
hand. The style of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is turgid throughout. The language is everywhere
stronger than the feeling; and what worse condemnation of a literary production
could there be? There is a striving after the effect of excitement without genuine
excitement. This leads to the most absurd contortions of language, and to wilful
and unnecessary obscurity.</p>
<p>It is commonly said that there are some blunders that only a clever man can
make. Coriolanus shows intellect, but intellect gone astray.</p>
<p>One would be glad to think, if it were thinkable, that <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> was a spurious
work wrongly credited&mdash;or debited&mdash;to Shakespeare; but that is impossible.
Although it is what it is, it bears unmistakably the stamp of Shakespeare. So
again, one would like to fancy it was Shakespeare's satire on the Jingos, male and
female, of his day&mdash;for Jingos we always have with us; but neither is that pos-
sible. It stands for us a monument of fallen greatness. How great is that fall
will be appreciated by any student of drama who shall read, first, the utterances
of Coriolanus; and then any single scene in which Hamlet or Macbeth speaks;
or who will first take a course of Volumnia, and, after, turn for refreshment to
Cleopatra. If he does not then realise the difference between Shakespeare inspired
and uninspired, it will be a pity.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>The question naturally arises, how far is the drama indebted
to Plutarch for its unity and power? But one has only to read the two accounts
side by side to see in what an endless variety of ways Shakespeare has condensed,
hastened, unified, intensified, and supplemented the somewhat wandering story
of Plutarch. Shakespeare himself is the real source of the intimate, vigorous dra-
matic life that permeates the play. He recasts his material more freely here than
in <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra.</hi> He improves upon his original in the
greater vividness of the characters and in the closeness and skill of the inter-
weaving.</p>
<p>Excepting Coriolanus himself all the characters in Plutarch's sketch are faint
and vague. In Plutarch Menenius does not appear again after telling the fable of
the belly and the members. The tribunes disappear after Marcius is banished.
Aufidius is not mentioned until Marcius goes to his house, and is not present at
the great scene between Coriolanus and his mother. Volumnia has nothing to
do with the suit of Marcius for the consulship; and his solicitation for that office
is not brought into any connection either with the war against the Volscians or
with the banishment of the hero.</p>
<p>That the speech in which Coriolanus announces himself to Aufidius follows
Plutarch closely, and that &lsquo;nowhere has Shakespeare borrowed so much through
so great a number of lines as in Volumnia's appeal to the piety of her son&rsquo; are
facts which easily mislead one as to the extent of the poet's indebtedness to his
<pb n="668"/>
source. And the telling close of Volumnia's plea, which finally overpowers the
hero, is new to Shakespeare.</p>
<p>I must admit that the play seems to me defective at one point. In Plutarch
the opportune and skillful recounting of the fable of the belly and the members
by Menenius causes the plebeians to become reconciled to the patricians on con-
dition that the people be granted the tribunes with ample power. In the play,
while Menenius is talking to one body of plebeians, another company obtains from
the hostile patricians the concession that they may have tribunes to protect them.
This granting of tribunes has no natural relation to the bread-riot which Shake-
speare has depicted. The populace &lsquo;ask for bread and get a magistrate.&rsquo; Shake-
speare makes the colloquy between Menenius and his audience supremely vivid
and interesting. Hardly any serio-comic passage in the plays reads better. But
because it is not made causative in any way, super-excellent as it is in itself, it
is good for nothing. Surely this is an artistic mistake, an unfortunate alteration
of the story of Plutarch.</p>
<p>Two closely related actions make up the drama. The main action, the strife
between Brutus and Sicinius, the leaders of the plebeians, and Caius Marcius, is
prepared for at once in the outspoken bitterness of the common people toward
their especial enemy. The second action, the contest between Marcius and the
Volscians under Aufidius, is so closely involved with the first that it does not impair
the unity. The play is not divided because of this second line of interest; it is
enriched and enlarged. The interweaving of the two strands is intimate, com-
plete. The character, the deeds, and the fate of Caius Marcius constitute the
absorbing interest in which both actions are united.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p><hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is a one-part play, as
was <hi rend="italic">Richard III.,</hi> but the Roman piece is without the theatric variety and the
psychologic interest of the English history. It is intolerably monotonous in its
insistence upon a single character, dominated by a single unlovely characteristic&mdash;
an overmastering pride, supported by an inhuman contempt for all who do not
belong to his own caste. Pride goes before a fall, and Coriolanus sinks to the
infamy of becoming a traitor who takes command of the enemies of Rome and leads
them victorious to her walls. For this baseness he may have provocation enough,
but he has no real justification, and he admits himself that his revenge on his native
city is due to spite.</p>
<p>Shakspere exaggerates beyond belief the personal exploits of his hero. Coriolanus
is a stalwart fighter, but he reveals none of the qualities of a great general. He has
immense pride in his own prowess, in the strength of his thews; but he is narrow-
minded and lacking in any genuine magnanimity of soul. He is ill-balanced
and over-bearing; and such a character is too devoid of variety to attract play-
goers, even if it had been exhibited in an artfully contrived plot, which <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>
has not. Moreover, the only really dramatic situation in the story that Shakspere
finds in Plutarch&mdash;the surrender of Coriolanus to the appeal of his mother to spare
the Rome which has turned him out&mdash;even this is not made to yield its full effect.
It is probably this situation which led Shakspere to select the subject; and yet this
scene is not as well done as Shakspere had handled corresponding situations in
other plays. The speech of Volumnia to Coriolanus is a specimen of swelling
eloquence, a towering example of rhetorical amplification, a big speech in itself,
but it is wanting in heartfelt sincerity. A few simple moving words would have
served the purpose better than this sonorous oration. Although there is no weakening
<pb n="669"/>
here of the poet's power or of his intelligence, there seems to be a slackening
of enthusiasm and a consequent diminution of emotional appeal.</p>
<p>To this we may also ascribe the hardness of the play as a whole, its metallic
brilliancy, its repellent temper. The atmosphere is petty and the political conflict
in Rome is but a paltry factional fight. In <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi> the clash of the contending
parties is a struggle for imperial dominion; and in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> it is only an intra-
mural squabble. In <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi> we have world-politics, and in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> only
ward-politics. We do not sympathize with either party, and plainly enough Shak-
spere does not mean us to do so. He does not take sides himself, and we do not.
He is impartial, and we have an equal dislike for both of the contending groups.
The plebeians are crass and cowardly, and the patricians are cowardly and inca-
pable. The mob is as flighty and as feather-brained as the mob in <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar;</hi>
and the fathers of the city act rather as stepfathers, selfish and self-seeking. On
both sides there is a plentiful lack of common sense and of right feeling.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Shakespeare has with so clear a mind apprehended the his-
torical material, and has set it forth in such a masterly manner, that in looking
back we feel that hardly a wish is left unfulfilled. Besides, no one can gainsay
that in most of the scenes of the tragedy the language sounds forth like to a mighty
clarion, until towards the end it wearily dies away into silence. Nevertheless
there remains in the inmost soul of the reader a longing that is unsatisfied; it is
that feeling which in its tenderest depth cannot be adequately expressed. We
must by no means confound such a longing with the fond expression of a definite
affectionate relation between A. and B.; such would by no means satisfy this
particular longing, but would be absolutely at variance with it. That which is
lacking for us is not the fault of the poet, but rather that of the material, for which,
except for his magical power, we should be unable to feel any such interest as we
experience, for example, for Romeo, for Brutus, for Lear. In <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> almost
every character taking part is in the wrong; the hero himself and his opposer,
Aufidius, Menenius and the Tribunes, the Volscian as well as the Roman Senate,
but the Idea of State and Country stands forth predominant. The tragedy's
great goal is attained; whoever desires anything more than this desires here
something quite unsuitable and misplaced. We may <hi rend="italic">like,</hi> and I admit this to be
my feeling also, other works of our poet more than this one, but we should not forget
what both for itself and in itself it is.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> With <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> Shakespeare had now finished the dramatic
representation of Roman life. We do not possess any definite data as to the exact
date of composition of this piece. The only likelihood of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi>
having been finished earliermight be signified by the fact that at certain instances in
the almost overbold treatment of the language, as depicted here and there, and pos-
sibly, too, by the crude conception of human affairs, the guess is that it must have
occurred in the neighborhood of 1609 or possibly 1610&mdash;an epoch of important de-
cision for tracing at just this time the causes, the origin, duration, and possibly the
strength that prompted it, without being able to offer any positive solution as to
exact date. The seeming aristocracy of this drama rendered it a favorite piece of our
romanticists. English criticism, too, places it upon a high pedestal, though, justly,
not as high as <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar.</hi> The bold and the many-sided articulated char-
acteristics, the wealth of far-reaching thought, and the splendor of the language
will, forever, make for it a lasting impression. But we must not permit ourselves
<pb n="670"/>
to be led astray by the heroic distinction of the main character and because of the
specifically antique coloring to see it in that light and to prove its pitch accord-
ingly. Shakespeare creates in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> a great historic and moral problem as
offered to him through this antique legend, weaving into it his profound knowledge
of human character, his entire and impartial love of truth. As in Brutus is por-
trayed the vain struggle of an aristocratic idealist against the political minority
declaration of his degraded people; or in <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra,</hi> the quarrel of a
light-minded and sensual egotism, genial though at times, with that cold and conse-
quent ambition for power for the possession of a world, void of the spirit&mdash;so here,
too, is illumined the self-destruction of an aristocratic hero who, overestimating the
sensibility of personal strength, alienates himself from the only safe doctrine of
aristocratic dignity and power, by which is meant the surrender of the subjective
sympathy below the standard morality, the subjugation of a personal ambition
for patriotic interest. It is to prove that the natural tendency of the poet for
the aristocratic force over and above the common, the mediocre has brought about
aristocratic evils and aristocratic narrowmindedness, which is just as bad, as shown
in <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII.,</hi> where his Protestant tendency takes sides against the innocent,
ailing Catholic queen. But, if this highly human conception of the problem
shielded the poet from psychologic falsehood, it was in no way not sufficient to
afford the drama historic importance in the sense of the plays as derived from
English history. Plutarch's narrative, to be sure, did not only give all the details
of the outer action, but likewise a number of the most important moments of its
psychological development. But suddenly in it becomes visible a more mythical
than historic tradition, full of contradictions, a reflective consciousness of the nar-
rator, belonging to an entirely different world. Thus, it is no longer difficult to
prove that Shakespeare departed, too, from this muddy source wherever possible
and wherever is reflected the truly pure antique, but unknown to the monarchial-
aristocratic life of the State of the 16th century. As stated heretofore, we pay
little or no attention to the many anachronisms occurring <hi rend="italic">en masse,</hi> but without
having reference to the action of the play itself. We are interested neither in the
antique nor in the modern characters of the drama; we are not interested that
Cominius speaks of Roman theaters, that Titus Lartius refers to Cato, that
Menenius compares Coriolanus' voice to the sound of a knell, his &lsquo;hm&rsquo; to a
battery, himself with Alexander, the Macedonian. It is not at all necessary to
go into such details as far as the poet's imagination is concerned, and, because of
it, deny the drama every importance of its artistic value. Shakespeare does not
owe his antiquarian knowledge to any specific or systematic study, but merely
draws it from the perusal of moral and poetic substance. Wherever he beheld an
insinuation, a comparison suitable to his purpose, he little cared whether or not
the speaker living in this or that century B. C., or possessed the requisite under-
standing for this or that. Then, too, the conception of action referring to the
most important situations of life vary rather vividly from the historic notions so
that it would not seem just not to take note of such changes in defining our stand-
point for the benefit of the historic, moral, and esthetic conception and value.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>In the three Roman pieces&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus, Julius C&aelig;sar,</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi>&mdash;the moderation with which Shakspeare excludes foreign
appendages and arbitrary suppositions, and yet fully satisfied the wants of the
stage, is particularly deserving of our admiration. These plays are the very
thing itself; and under the apparent artlessness of adhering closely to history as
<pb n="671"/>
he found it, an uncommon degree of art is concealed. Of every historical trans-
action Shakspeare knows how to seize the true poetical point of view, and to
give unity and rounding to a series of events detached from the immeasurable
extent of history without in any degree changing them. The public life of ancient
Rome is called up from its grave, and exhibited before our eyes with the utmost
grandeur and freedom of the dramatic form, and the heroes of Plutarch are en-
nobled by the most eloquent poetry.</p>
<p>In <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> we have more comic intermixtures than in the others, as the
many-headed multitude plays here a considerable part; and when Shakspeare
portrays the blind movements of the people in a mass, he almost always gives him-
self up to his merry humor. To the plebeians, whose folly is certainly sufficiently
conspicuous already, the original old satirist Menenius is added by way of abun-
dance. This gives rise to droll scenes of a description altogether peculiar, and
which are alone compatible with such a political drama; for instance, when Corio-
lanus, to obtain the consulate, must solicit the lower order of citizens whom he
holds in contempt for their cowardice in war, but cannot so far master his haughty
disposition as to assume the customary humility, and yet extorts from them their
votes.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>Fondness for the Roman state, whose mighty career
Shakespeare contemplates in this play with the proud satisfaction of one belonging
to it, seems to have induced the poet, after the completion of <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra,</hi>
to take up once more the better days of the first military greatness of this people,
and to treat a more noble subject out of its history. As in Antony he had repre-
sented the imperial time and its degeneracy, and in C&aelig;sar the struggle of the
republic with monarchy, in Coriolanus he brings before us the struggle between the
aristocratic and the democratic elements within the republic. The play is filled
with the striving of the two powers, tribunes and consuls, plebeians and patricians,
senate and people; the complaints and reproaches customary between ruler and
subjects, between official and privileged persons and those who bear the burden
and perform the labours, are evenly balanced against each other. The opposition
between these two powers is everywhere exhibited as founded on their nature;
the implacable enmity between them is shown as a necessary result of the impru-
dence, unreasonableness, and harshness of their contrast. The inconstancy in the
people is contrasted with the obstinacy, the one-sidedness, and the scorn in the
representative of aristocracy; the dishonesty on the one side is opposed to the
boundless ambition on the other, proud contempt to envious hatred, deep desire
of revenge to the passing intoxication of retaliation, the lingering grudge to the
superficial repentance. The incompatibility of the higher and stronger nature
with the weaker and lower is described; for this is inevitable, unless on one side
wise modesty condescends, and on the other grateful respect for merit elevates.
The contrasts and contentions of these two political states and powers are so
thoroughly treated of in our play, that this very struggle of the aristocratic and
democratic principles has usually been considered as the spirit of it, as if the leading
thought of the poet had been a purely political one. But it always seemed to us
that these three Roman plays were so highly and generally estimated, just on ac-
count of the elevation of history to pure drama, the union of the political idea
with a moral one, and the mixture of historical with psychological excellence. We
are inclined to believe that those political relations are inherent in the subject,
and form with it that general foundation on which the actual centre of the piece
<pb n="672"/>
must first be sought. The internal connection of the three plays and their themes
with one another will quickly place this in a clear light. In <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi> the
political subject was the struggle of the republic with monarchy; within this gen-
eral subject of the great historical action we were, however, attracted by the sharp
discord between a political and a moral duty, which affects the hero of the play
and which is the kernel of the real dramatic action. In <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi>
the historical theme is the struggle of the active Roman spirit against the influx
of oriental effeminacy, and here, we may say, the political and the moral centre
coincided; Antony's individual hesitation between his active vocation in the world
and his pursuit of sensual enjoyment is the first great symptom of the like state
of the times. In <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> the political basis is the struggle between the aristo-
cratic and democratic elements; in this struggle the hero finds himself placed in a
situation where he has to choose between his patriotism and his private feelings
of hatred. Brutus renounced his friendship with C&aelig;sar, the supposed enemy of
his country, out of greater devotion to his country, being as noble in policy as he
was mistaken in morals; Antony renounced friendships that were useful to his
country, and formed others that were injurious, being both in policy and morals
equally easy and negligent; Coriolanus renounced an enmity with the enemy of
his people, to the ruin of his country, being politically and morally hardened in
selfishness. The sort of characters which have to decide in these situations, and
the prominent qualities in them, by means of which they decide in this way or
in that, this is everywhere the actual centre towards which the poet worked,
and his leading thought here, as we everywhere demonstrate, is of a moral psycho-
logical nature. Brutus' really difficult choice is decided by the fundamental
firmness and uprightness of a truly manly mind; Antony's choice, which ought to
be no choice, is, in strong contrast to Brutus, decided by the unmanly weakness
and meanness of an effeminate voluptuary; Coriolanus, again, in double contrast
to both, is guided by the lofty pride and high ambition of a manly character, in
which an excess of selfishness unnaturally tends to unbending obstinacy which
blunts itself. In Brutus, the noblest citizen contended with the noblest man;
in Antony, the sensualist celebrated his triumph over the citizen summoned to
action; in Coriolanus, the sensitive man and the good citizen is subdued by a
heroism exaggerated by pride. A heroism, we say, because indeed the physical
qualities and characteristics of Coriolanus surpass, as in heroic times, ordinary
human greatness; an exaggerated heroism, we added, because, compared with
similar descriptions of similar relations in the heroic ages, this stands prominent
in the might of passion. Homer's enraged Meleager and Achilles, in like scorn
and obstinacy, soften when they see fire carried into the friendly city or ships;
Coriolanus is ready to throw the fire-brand with his own hand into his native city.</p>
<p>Even if we give up our usual plan of seeking in every one of Shakespeare's
dramas a fundamental moral view, it is by no means unimportant, in forming a
judgment on this play, whether we take the political or the psychological idea as
the basis for our consideration. If we take the political struggle between the two
orders to be the main point, we shall readily arrive at wrong conclusions. To
instance only one. We see Coriolanus, as the chief representative of the aristoc-
racy, in strong opposition to the people and the tribunes; hence we naturally take
up the view expressed by Hazlitt, that Shakespeare had a leaning to the arbitrary
side of the question, to the aristocratical principle, inasmuch as he does not dwell
on the truths he tells of the nobles in the same proportion as he does on those he
tells of the people. Hazlitt has added excellent grounds for proving even the
<pb n="673"/>
naturalness and need of this inclination in the poet. . . . Shakespeare has depicted
the man of freedom, Brutus, nay, even the harder master-spirit of the revolution,
Cassius, far nobler and with much more love than the man of the aristocracy,
Coriolanus. It will be allowed that, from the example of Brutus, many more would
be won over to the cause of the people than would be won over to aristocratic
principles by Coriolanus. If we regard Coriolanus not merely in reference to the
many, but if we weigh his character in itself and with itself, we must confess, after
the closest consideration, that personified aristocracy is here represented in its
noblest and in its worst side, with that impartiality which Shakespeare's nature
could scarcely avoid. It may be replied, the people are not so depicted. Yet
even on the nobles as a body our poet has just as little thrown a favourable light
at last; for it lies in the nature of things that a multitude can never be compared
with one man who is to be the subject of poetical representation, and who, on that
very account, must stand alone, one single man distinguished from the many. But
it may be said, the representatives of the people, the tribunes also, are not thus
impartially depicted. Yet where would have been the poetic harmony, if Shake-
speare had made these prominent? where the truth, if he had given dignity and
energy to a new power created in a tumult? where our sympathy in his hero, if
he had placed a Marcus Brutus in opposition to him in the tribunate? In pro-
portion as he had raised our interest in the tribunes, he would have withdrawn
it from Coriolanus, who had already enough to do to bear his own burden of
declension.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> The first cycle of Roman plays brings before us the political
life and history of the progress of the Roman people (the basis of modern politi-
cal life) in all its essential moments; <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> gives us the contests between the
plebeians and patricians and the progressive development of the republic; <hi rend="italic">Julius
C&aelig;sar,</hi> the last fruitless struggles of the dying republic with the rise of the new
monarchical form of government; <hi rend="italic">Antony and Cleopatra,</hi> the downfall of the
oligarchy and the nature of the empire; <hi rend="italic">Titus Andronicus,</hi> the inevitable decay
of the ancient spirit and position of the Roman empire, in face of the Germanic
nations, and the new principle of life which the latter introduced into the political
history of Europe. <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> contains the tragic conflict which qualifies the
historical drama to become a pathetic tragedy. Here, as in Shakespeare throughout,
the political is met by the ethical, moral element. It is for political reasons alone
(because Rome has fallen into the power of the populace) that Coriolanus wages
war against his native city; but the political element cannot be so entirely sepa-
rated from the ethical and general element of human nature as he thinks. By
threatening his own country, he also threatens his own house; by tearing himself
away from the former, he at the same time breaks his family bond; by valuing
the political form (from a purely political standpoint) more than the political sub-
stance, <hi rend="italic">i. e.,</hi> more than the spiritual and physical welfare of the citizens, he de-
stroys the welfare of the latter as well as that of his own family; in short, by en-
deavouring only to preserve his political rights, and to do his political duty, he
violates the moral duty of patriotism, as well as the love and affection due towards
mother, wife, and child. It is true that, in the end, the moral feeling does overcome
his political rigorism; but the violation of the moral law weighs too heavily, and
penetrates too deeply, for him to repair what he has injured; even though he had
not fallen a victim to the revengeful spirit of the Volscians, his life would never-
theless have been utterly ruined.
<pb n="674"/>
The opponents of Coriolanus, however, appear also involved in a similar con-
flict, a similar contradiction. Even the people, now and again, forget their political
part, their democratic aspirations, and the poet&mdash;with an unmistakable touch of
irony&mdash;shows us that it is partly hunger, partly an irresistible human feeling of
respect for a great character that carries off the victory over the democratic prin-
ciple. Did not the well-known fable of old Menenius Agrippa&mdash;about the quarrel
between the belly and the other members of the body&mdash;suffice to quell a revolt?</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>In his <hi rend="italic">Tragedy of Coriolanus</hi> Shakespeare
has appropriated the fatal denouement as given by Plutarch. According to an
entirely different version of the story as related by Livy, following Fabius Pictor,
Marcius, retired in Antium, was spared by the Volscians, and, through their
indulgence, lived in unhappy exile until extreme old age. I do not know whether
the English poet had read this account by the Latin historian, with which, through
Philemon Holland's translation in 1600, he might have been made familiar. Even
supposing he had known it, I have no doubt he would have systematically rejected
the peaceful conclusion mentioned by Livy. If ever, indeed, Shakespearian provi-
dence had to inflict exemplary chastisement, it is in this very case. If ever tragic
expiation was deserved, it was by Coriolanus.</p>
<p>At the moment when Marcius falls beneath the swords of the Volscians let us
recollect all the outrages committed by the victim. His life was but one long
conspiracy against human and divine laws. In contempt of the eternal right, on
which is founded the equality of men; in scorn of the social constitution which
proclaims it, he wished to enslave the city to an oligarchy of the family, and sub-
ject the majority of his fellow creatures to a privileged caste. In order to estab-
lish the authority of this caste he counselled the employment of every means&mdash;
violence, deception, ambuscades, massacre! Let us recollect the horrible threat
which but lately he addressed to the starving people: &lsquo;Ah! would the nobility but
lay aside their scruples, and allow me to draw the sword, I would make a hecatomb
of corpses as high as my lance!&rsquo; Marcius abused the prerogatives which he held
by right of birth; those splendid qualities which he received for good purposes
he made use of for bad; he used virtue to enact injustice, prostituted magnanimity
to pride, and made heroism the supporter of tyranny. When the people, warned
by their Tribunes, had foiled the plot made against their liberties, when, by a
necessary arrest, they banished this dangerous citizen, what did Marcius do?
In consequence of this decree so justly pronounced against him by his country he
called upon the enemies of his country. This time it is not only a single class, it
is all classes of society which Marcius wishes to sacrifice to his wounded pride.
Adversaries and allies, plebeians and patricians, commons and nobles, peasants
and princes, all must succumb pellmell to this fierce rancor. Fooled by overween-
ing, Coriolanus pretends that he no longer has a heart; he casts far from him as
weaknesses all sympathy and all affection; he no longer recognises parenthood.
It is in presence of this last outrage that humanity, so many times offended, at
last makes its protest heard. The inner man casts aside the cloak of arrogance of
the aristocrat and refuses to obey. Nature, calling to her aid all her sentiments
in revolt, turns against this insensate pride and crushes it in calling forth a cry for
pity from this unpitiable one. Then we assist at a sublime scene. This being
who imagined himself superior to all other beings is obliged, for his chastisement,
to submit to every human emotion. He thought, beneath his armour, that he
was invulnerable to passion, and behold him bathed in tears, moved to his inmost
<pb n="675"/>
depths by the threefold tenderness of son, of husband, and of father. Filial love,
conjugal love, paternal love, all the elementary affections of the soul suddenly take
possession of this renegade and drag him to punishment. Admirable lesson offered
by the poet for meditation by the ages! It is by the family that the patrician is
touched.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>The hero offers a capital study for those who,
in their estimates of men, have not learned to temper their thoughts to &lsquo;a web
of mingled yarn,&rsquo; such as human nature, even in its best specimens, ordinarily
presents. The character is a very mixed one; and all its parts, good and bad, are
fashioned on so large a scale as to yield matter enough for making out a strong case
either way, according as the observer's mind is set to a course of all blame or all
praise; while at the same time the several lines are so energetic and bold as to
render it not easy for one to steer clear of all extremes, and so to take the impression
of a given side as to fit the subject all round.</p>
<p>In strict keeping with Plutarch's account of the man, Shakespeare represents
pride as the back-bone of his composition. And his pride is rendered altogether
inflammable and uncontrollable by passion, insomuch that, let but a spark of
provocation be struck into the latter, and the former at once flames up beyond
measure, and sweeps away all the regards of prudence, of decorum, and even of
life. It is therefore perfectly characteristic of the man that an unexpected word
of scornful reproach stings him to the quick: the instant it touches his ear, he ex-
plodes like a rocket. It is on this principle that the wily Tribunes work, plying
their craft and watching their time to provoke him into some fatal provocation of
popular resentment. Hence the Poet, with great judgment, and without any hint
from the history, makes Aufidius, when the time is ripe for firing off the conspiracy
<pb n="676"/>
against his life, touch him into an ecstasy of passionate rage by spitting the
term &lsquo;boy&rsquo; at him. Now, his very pride, if duly guarded by the ensconcements
of reason and self-respect, would have caused him, from the monstrous unfitness
of such an epithet, to answer it with calm and silent scorn; but he seems to resent
it in proportion as it strikes wide of him, and makes its very unfitness to him the
cause of its power over him.</p>
<p>The natural working of these qualities, together with the gigantic structure of
the man in other parts, made his character an apt and inviting occasion to repre-
sent the struggle between those two antagonistic elements in the state, which in
their reconcilement and unity did much towards rearing up the solid greatness and
grandeur of old Rome. There is in the people much that is really despicable. This
the hero seizes on greedily, and makes the most of, as favouring that whereon his
pride fastens, and at the same time winks away whatsoever there is in them of a
redeeming quality: he scorns their meanness, and is glad to find it in them as
giving him cause for scorning them; will see in them nothing but what is vile, and
would fain make them as vile as he thinks them, that so his scorn may stand justified
to his sense of right. Still he is placed where his pride can only come at its proper
food by their suffrage; for its dearest gratification he must needs look to that which
most galls and offends it. This puts him upon trying to extort their admiration
and homage while making them hate his person: what he most prides himself
upon is to have his greatness force honours from them in spite of his insolence to
them; because such an inverse proportion between their returns and receipts
serves to magnify and set off his superiority. This is well shown in what falls
from one of those almost characterless persons of the drama, in whom the Poet
sometimes puts much candour and shrewdness of observation, and then uses
them as the mouth-piece of his own judgment: &lsquo;If he did not care whether he
had their love or no, he would wave indifferently 'twixt doing them neither good nor
harm; but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him,
and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite.&rsquo; Hence,
when he goes out to beg their voices, he takes care to season his requests with scorn,
and to let them see that his spirit still disclaims what his tongue speaks; then, if they
excuse his spirit on the score of his formal compliance, this will be his triumph.</p>
<p>The hero's pride, however, is far from being of a mean and narrow cast; nobly
elemented out of the various regards of rank, family, country, talents, and courage,
it therefore partakes the general greatness of his character; is of a towering and
majestic pitch; and as it grows not less by what he derives from and shares with
others, than by what is peculiar to himself, so it is of that high and generous scope
that commonly issues in great virtues as well as great faults. Hence it is nowise
such as, of itself, to eat out the better juices of humanity; on the contrary, modesty,
gratitude, openness of heart and hand, are its chosen playfellows; and it is of an
element that would keep clean and fresh the breast where it dwells, and under
whose stern yet free patronage, tenderness of heart, purity and rectitude of life,
and many of the milder and gentler qualities, have their best cherishing; a sure
source of replenishment to whatsoever virtues it guards, because its own best
sources of thrift are in the noble growth it fosters. Which is rarely shown in that,
with all his passionate craving after fame, he still counts it his highest honour to
be the cause that others are honoured. For he is as jealous of the merit as of the
position of his fellow-Patricians; would guard their virtue as carefully as their
rank; is not less strenuous to have them deserve than to have them hold the place
of supreme rule and reverence in the state. He is prouder, too, of his mother than
<pb n="677"/>
of himself; cares more to please her than himself; owns no titles to honour in him-
self but what he can refer to that honoured source, nor covets any returns but such
as will magnify the part she has in him; in brief, he looks up to her as a superior
being whose benediction is the best grace of his life; and his profound awe of her
person and of her rights in him is itself a principle of such intrinsic greatness and
energy as would burst asunder the cold dry ligatures of an ignoble and ungenerous
nature. When, upon her coming out to intercede with him, he says, &lsquo;My mother
bows; as if Olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod,&rsquo; we have the sub-
limity of filial reverence, imaged in a form not more magnificent in itself than
characteristic of the speaker.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>Although the play of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> almost
inevitably suggests a digression into the consideration of the politics of Shakspere,
it must once again be asserted that the central and vivifying element in the play
is not a political problem, but an individual character and life. The tragic struggle
of the play is not that of patricians with plebeians, but of Coriolanus with his
own self. It is not the Roman people who bring about his destruction; it is the
patrician haughtiness and passionate self-will of Coriolanus himself. Were the
contest of political parties the chief interest of Shakspere's drama, the figures of
the Tribunes must have been drawn upon a larger scale. They would have been
endowed with something more than &lsquo;foxship.&rsquo; As representatives of a great
principle, or of a power constantly tending in one direction, they might have ap-
peared worthy rivals of the leaders of the patrician party; and the fall of Coriolanus
would be signalised by some conquest and advance of the tide of popular power.
Shakspere's drama is the drama of individuality, including under this name all
those bonds of duty and of affection which attach man to his fellow-man, but not
impersonal principles and ideas. The passion of patriotism, high-toned and en-
thusiastic, stands with Shakspere instead of general political principles and ideas,
and the life of the individual is widened and elevated by the national life, to which
the individual surrenders himself with gladness and with pride.</p>
<p>The pride of Coriolanus is, however, not that which comes from self-surrender to
and union with some power, or person, or principle higher than oneself. It is two-
fold, a passionate self-esteem which is essentially egoistic; and secondly, a passionate
prejudice of class. His nature is the reverse of cold or selfish; his sympathies are
deep, warm, and generous; but a line, hard and fast, has been drawn for him by the
aristocratic tradition, and it is only within that line that he permits his sympathies
to play. To the surprise of the Tribunes, he can accept well-pleased a subordinate
command under Cominius. He yields with kindly condescension to accept the
devotion and fidelity of Menenius, and cherishes towards the old man a filial
regard&mdash;the feeling of a son, who has the consciousness that he is greater than his
father. He must dismiss Menenius disappointed from the Volscian camp; but
he contrives an innocent fraud by means of which the old senator will fancy that
he has effected more for the peace of Rome than another could. For Virgilia,
the gentle woman in whom his heart finds rest, Coriolanus has a manly tenderness,
and constant freshness of adhesion:
<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;O, a kiss</l>
<l>Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!</l>
<l>Now by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss</l>
<l>I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip</l>
<l>Hath virgin'd it e'er since.&rsquo;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 5.3">shak. cor 5.3.44</bibl></cit>

<pb n="678"/>
In his boy he has a father's joy, and yields to an ambitious hope, and a yearning
forward to his son's possible future of heroic action, in which there is something
of touching, paternal weakness:
<cit><quote><l part="F">&lsquo;The god of soldiers,</l>
<l>With the consent of supreme Jove, inform</l>
<l>Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou may'st prove</l>
<l>To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars</l>
<l>Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,</l>
<l>And saving those that eye thee!&rsquo;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 5.3">shak. cor 5.3.70</bibl></cit>

His wife's friend Valeria is the &lsquo;moon of Rome,&rsquo;
<cit><quote><l part="F">&lsquo;Chaste as the icicle</l>
<l>That's curdied by the frost from purest snow</l>
<l>And hangs on Dian's temple.&rsquo;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 5.3.65">shak. cor 5.3.65</bibl></cit>

In his mother Volumnia, the awful Roman matron, he rejoices with a noble enthusi-
asm and pride; and while she is present always feels himself, by comparison with
this great mother, inferior and unimportant.</p>
<p>But Cominius, Menenius, and Virgilia, Valeria and Volumnia, and his boy
belong to the privileged class; they are patrician. Beyond this patrician class
neither his sympathies nor his imagination find it possible to range. The plebeians
are &lsquo;a common cry of curs&rsquo; whose breath Coriolanus hates. He cannot, like
Bolingbroke, flatter their weakness while he despises them inwardly. He is not
even indifferent towards them; he rather rejoices in their malice and displeasure;
if the nobility would let him use his sword he would make a quarry &lsquo;with thousands
of these quarter'd slaves,&rsquo; as high as he could pick his lance. Sicinius the Tribune
is &lsquo;the Triton of the minnows.&rsquo; When Coriolanus departs from Rome, as though
all the virtue of the city were resident in himself, he reverses the apparent fact,
and pronounces a sentence of banishment against those whom he leaves behind:
&lsquo;I banish you.&rsquo; Brutus is warranted by the fact when he says
<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;You speak o' the people, as if you were a god,</l>
<l>To punish; not a man, of their infirmity.&rsquo;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 3.1">shak. cor 3.1.83</bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>And yet the weakness, the inconstancy, and the incapacity of apprehending facts
which are the vices of the people, reflect and repeat themselves in the great patrician;
his aristocratic vices counterbalance their plebeian. He is rigid and obstinate;
but under the influence of an angry egoism he can renounce his principle, his
party, and his native city. He will not bear away to his private use the paltry
booty of the Volces; but to obtain the consulship he is urged by his proud mother
and his patrician friends to stand bareheaded before the mob, to expose his wounds,
to sue for their votes, to give his heart the lie, to bend the knee like a beggar
asking an alms. The judgment and blood of Coriolanus are ill commingled; he
desires the end, but can only half submit to the means which are necessary to attain
that end; he has not sufficient self-control to enable him to dispose of those chances
of which he is lord. And so he mars his fortune. The pride of Coriolanus, as
Mr Hudson has observed, is &lsquo;rendered altogether inflammable and uncontrollable
by passion; insomuch that if a spark of provocation is struck into the latter, the
former instantly flames up beyond measure, and sweeps away all the regards of
prudence, of decorum, and even of common sense.&rsquo; Now such passion as this
Shakspere knew to be weakness and not strength; and by this uncontrollable
<pb n="679"/>
violence of temper Coriolanus draws down upon himself his banishment from Rome,
and his subsequent fate.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>The mother had instilled into Coriolanus his bravery and
desire of glory; these had led to pride; his pride had grown to excess, to a more
than human strength of will and action. But the extreme in his nature, we have
said, passed everywhere over into its opposite, his honourable bravery into a
jealousy that took away the honourable aim which his deeds should ever have had;
his valuable political gifts were put to the most hurtful use; his fury and passion
were changed into forced calmness, pride into modesty, truth and uprightness into
dissimulation, unbending rigidity into softness of feeling and even fickleness.
Coriolanus enters the house of Aufidius with reflections on the changes of the
world; how friendship breaks out into enmity for a doit, and hatred into friend-
ship for some trick not worth an egg; so is it with him, he says himself, with him
who had always so deeply despised the populace for their fickleness! On two great
occasions in his history we see him fall from want of self-government, from over-
strained passion and irritability, once on the occasion of his banishment, and again
at his death. On both occasions a single word, the opprobrious epithet of &lsquo;traitor,&rsquo;
brings on the fatal outbreak of his fury. This shows in a very remarkable manner
the fine turning-point by which he missed the result of all his strivings. If this
name were rightly bestowed on him, then no reproach could be thought of which
would so immediately shatter the noble work of Volumnia, and overturn the
object of all the proud endeavours of Coriolanus as this. If he were a traitor, then
his glory was turned into shame, his bravery misapplied, his pride dishonoured,
his civic virtue changed into selfishness, his truth and fidelity into their reverse,
his most honourable efforts covered with the coarsest stains. And it cannot be
denied that he became a traitor to Rome after he first heard this word of reproach,
and he was one to the Antiates when he heard it the second time. This mother,
the giver and the shaper of his life, had brought him into both situations; she,
therefore, meets her punishment with him. The first time, in a movement of
motherly weakness, she had tempted him, contrary to a right instinct, into a
false path, and thereby drawn down upon him the unmerited reproach of being
a traitor, which he then hastened to deserve; this fault she and he also repaired,
when, in a noble spirit of patriotism, she allured him back from his mistaken search
after vengeance into the path of humanity, which he trod with death before his
eyes. The name of traitor suits him now, indeed, but rather to his glory than to
his disgrace, and his death atones for his life.</p>
<p>We perceive, from the treatment of this character, that the poet elaborated it
not so much with love as with great interest; it is not exactly a pleasant, but a
powerful impression which we carry away from the consideration of the play and
of the character, which in fact fills up the whole of it. To explain this we must
remember that, not only earlier, but at that time, Shakespeare's warmest sym-
pathies rested on that unobtrusive greatness and on that plain, unexaggerated
nature which he had depicted in Prince Henry and in Posthumus. As he had
before contrasted his Percy with this form of character, he now did the same with
Coriolanus, but far more remotely. And we may imagine that just this sharp
contrast and its representation must have had a great charm for the poet, who
with the most unbiassed mind perceived and acknowledged the peculiar alloy in
every character. But what a large and comprehensive mind is this, that with so
much love now sketches the characters of a Brutus and a Posthumus, their severe
<pb n="680"/>
virtue and calm composure; then represents the expressive pride of this hero,
Coriolanus, in the most accurate and full development of a heart that discloses
little; and then, again, contrasts with this overstrained nature the weak characters
of Antony and Timon, which lie in quite a different sphere, and which again he
described with such mastery and penetration as might seem to betray in the poet
himself a preference for these forms of human nature.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Marcius, as he is called before his gallant behaviour at the tak-
ing of the town of Corioli gained for him the surname of Coriolanus, makes his
entrance upon the scene in the midst of the excited populace, with contemptuous
and insulting words upon his lips. So far there is no difficulty in admitting his
contempt for the mob, proceeding as it does from a lofty sense of honour and of
right. It is no petty pride of caste that vents itself in his burning words, but the
pride of a noble nature; the man who thus expresses himself is an aristocrat in the
best sense of the word, and we feel that with him the first title to nobility is cour-
age&mdash;not the mere bearing of a noble name or coat-of-arms&mdash;and that he would
willingly agree with the father of Don Juan, that &lsquo;birth goes for nothing if valour
is absent.&rsquo; But at the same time, he would never go so far with the father of
Don Juan as to prefer the honest, worthy son of a porter to a degenerate prince
or patrician, for the notion of a porter being worth consideration would never even
occur to him. To his mind, all real merit belonged exclusively to the noble classes;
and for the common people, one and all, he entertained on principle a supreme
contempt. His only feeling towards them was that of a boundless and outrage-
ously absurd and unjust disdain. For him they were in fact devoid of all rights,
natural as well as political; that he should wish to abolish the recently granted
office of tribunes was a small matter&mdash;he went far beyond this, and would not
even recognize their right to live, or to eat &lsquo;even as dogs must,&rsquo; or to be hungry.
When the pride of birth reaches such an altitude as this, it simply places the
speaker outside the circle of humanity, and inevitably lays him open to the retort
of the tribune, Junius Brutus,
<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;You speak o' the people, as if you were a god,</l>
<l>To punish; not a man, of their infirmity&rsquo; (III, i, 103, 104).</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 3.1">shak. cor 3.1.83</bibl></cit></p>
<p>These are the two sides, good and bad, of the aristocratic nature of Coriolanus.
True valour could alone win his approbation, and a nobleman unworthy of his
birth would never find favour in his sight; but he considered this and every other
virtue to be the exclusive possession of the patricians, and the only sentiment
excited in him by the poorer classes&mdash;called by a saintly King of France, the
&lsquo;common people of our Lord&rsquo;&mdash;was that of a pitiless and inhuman scorn.</p>
<p>This duality of temperament was great, fostered by the education he had received
from his mother, a Roman matron of a lofty but rigid nature, who kindled a warm
and generous spirit in him, but also taught him to call the plebeians
<cit><quote><l part="F">&lsquo;Woollen vassals, things created</l>
<l>To buy and sell with groats; to show bare heads</l>
<l>In congregations, to yawn, be still, and wonder,</l>
<l>When one but of my ordinance stood up</l>
<l>To speak of peace or war.&rsquo;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 3.2">3.2.10</bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>But this haughtiness of temper arose not merely from aristocratic instincts, in
what they have of either good or bad; other elements mingled in it, and no ade-
<pb n="681"/>

quate definition of its nature and species can be arrived at if it is considered
merely from a social standpoint, as an intense class-prejudice, nor would it be
very easy to understand all his conduct. For the pride of Coriolanus was essentially
a personal pride, and intensely egoistical. A word that drops from his mouth at
the beginning of the play clearly shows that the interests of his party, and even
of his country, only hold a secondary place in his heart, and that his own glory
and aggrandizement was, and would remain to the end, his primary consideration.
Speaking of the Volscians, the enemies of Rome, he says (I, i, 249-257):
<cit><quote><l part="F">&lsquo;They have a leader,</l>
<l>Tullus Aufidius, . . .</l>
<l>And were I anything but what I am,</l>
<l>I would wish me only he. . . .</l>
<l>Were half to half the world by the ears, and he</l>
<l>Upon my party, I'd revolt, to make</l>
<l>Only my wars with him.&rsquo;</l></quote><bibl n="shak. cor 1.1">shak. cor 1.1.229</bibl></cit>

A striking contrast to these singularly un-Romanlike sentiments may be found in
those of Corneille's Horatius:
<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;My country must command against what foe</l>
<l>I am to fight; my duty is to obey:</l>
<l>A soldier's lightest glory doth consist</l>
<l>In full obedience to his country's word,</l>
<l>And he who lets a single thought intrude</l>
<l>Of private ends, deserves the name of traitor.</l>
<l>And now Rome bids me draw my sword, I arm</l>
<l>And tarry not to reason.&rsquo;</l></quote><bibl></bibl></cit>

Here we have the true ring of Roman patriotism. But mark how admirably the
exclamation of Shakespeare's Coriolanus strikes the key-note both of his character
and of his history, and prepares us for the crime against his country to which his
overweening pride will in the sequel lead him on. The man who is capable of
betraying his cause simply for the pleasure of fighting with Aufidius may one
day be driven, out of mere resentment, to seek the alliance of this very enemy in
order to wreak his vengeance upon Rome if it happens to offend him.</p>
<p>With Coriolanus the violence of his temper was even greater than his pride;
had he simply been haughty, he would have met the insults of the Tribune with a
calm and cold disdain; but the least word of even unmerited abuse threw him into
a frenzy, and worked him up into a rage like that of a passionate woman or child.
In the final scene of the tragedy the epithet of traitor, added to that of &lsquo;boy of
tears,&rsquo; causes another frantic outburst, and precipitates him on the daggers of the
Volscians. This excessive sensitiveness to personal affronts, it may be noted in
passing, is a purely modern quality, far removed from the more self-contained,
grave, and manly Coriolanus of antiquity.</p>
<p>But it is when the sentence of perpetual banishment is pronounced upon him
by the people that he rises to the full height of his stature. This is the climax and
culminating point of the drama, the moment that would be chosen by a great
painter to represent in all his greatness this embodiment of passion and of
pride:
<pb n="682"/>
<cit><quote><l>&lsquo;You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate</l>
<l>As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize</l>
<l>As the dead carcases of unburied men</l>
<l>That do corrupt my air. I banish you. . . .</l>
<l part="F">Despising,</l>
<l>For you, the city, thus I turn my back:</l>
<l>There is a world elsewhere.&rsquo;</l></quote>
<bibl n="shak. cor 3.3">shak. cor 3.3.123</bibl></cit>
</p>
<p>The attitude of Coriolanus is simply sublime&mdash;standing forth alone, greater by
himself than all Rome, hurling back on his judges their sentence of exile, and op-
posing to the city that thrusts him out, his own colossal personality.</p>
<p>From this moment a strange alteration takes place in Coriolanus, and he becomes
calm; a change which is the effect of his very violence, and due to the extreme gravity
of his position. Plutarch mentions it as only the cloak under which he hid his
intense indignation and thirst for vengeance, but it went deeper than this. From
the moment that he conceived the plan of his revenge, a decadence both mental
and moral took place within him, the consciousness of which must have well-nigh
begun his expiation. To approach the Volscians disguised in mean apparel, to
inquire civilly from a passer-by where Aufidius dwelt, to say to the servants who
gave him but a rough reception, &lsquo;Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth,&rsquo;
and to present himself as an ally and guest before the master of the house, his mortal
enemy, must have been so many bitter trials to his haughty nature.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>Shakespeare's Coriolanus is
cast in a Titanic mould. His deeds &lsquo;should not be uttered feebly.&rsquo; All his char-
acteristics are of superb dimensions. A born soldier, he is in mere brute strength
a giant who can turn a man about with his finger and his thumb as one would
set a top spinning. He has the courage of a lion and is as stubborn. His voice is
always pitched in the same thunderous and masterful key. He knows nothing of
&lsquo;the soft way,&rsquo; nothing of mildness. He is &lsquo;ill-schooled in bolted language.&rsquo; It
is impossible for him &lsquo;to practice the insinuating nod.&rsquo; His manner in peace has
the austerity befitting a time of war. The unflinching pride, which is his ruling
passion, is a &lsquo;soaring insolence,&rsquo; which defies all conditions of practical prudence.
No turn in the wheel of fortune can modify that colossal sense of the sacredness
of caste with which his mother's milk has infected him. Men engaged in trade or
manual labour are for him an inferior race, of a closer affinity to the beasts of the
field than to his own hereditary rank. They are curs, rats, hares, geese. Their
&lsquo;stinking breaths&rsquo; and &lsquo;greasy caps&rsquo; render equal intercourse with them unthink-
able. He cannot tolerate their unwashed hands and unbrushed teeth. He speaks
of the people as if he were &lsquo;a god to punish; not a man, of their infirmity&rsquo; (III, i,
103, 104). The spirit of fraternity which graced the soldiership of Shakespeare's
favoured hero, Henry V., is to the haughty temper of Coriolanus an undignified
weakness. Scathing scorn for the &lsquo;beastly&rsquo; rabble&mdash;of the apron-men and the
mechanics&mdash;is for him an attitude of virtue.</p>
<p>Yet Coriolanus' pride of caste and stubborn temper are allied to a robust and
severe integrity. His magnificent egoism suggests intellectual rather than moral
failing. His brain lacks pliancy, and cannot modulate its workings. No sense of
humour modifies his thought Yet he has virtues of characteristic amplitude
and solidity. No sensual blemish is visible in his sturdy nature. He is incapable
of petty jealousy of his colleagues. He readily serves in a subordinate capacity
<pb n="683"/>

on the battle-field. He repudiates with convincing emphasis any suspicion of
covetousness. He cannot make his heart consent to take a bribe to pay his sword.
Praise is distasteful to him even from his mother. His wounds smart to hear
themselves remembered. He had rather venture all his limbs to honour than one
of his ears to hear it. He loathes exaggeration of his achievements. He cannot
idly sit to hear his nothings monstered. There is an inevitable aggressiveness
about his protestations of modesty, but their sincerity is unquestionable.</p>
<p>The intense manliness of his temperament provokes among his associates an
admiration, even an affection, which, within the bounds of his own class, he austerely
reciprocates. His fellow officers reverence him as &lsquo;the flower of warriors.&rsquo; The
veteran Menenius cherishes for him a parental affection, which excites in his
heart a filial echo. Men of his own rank readily find dignified excuses for his
exorbitant arrogance and his frank incapacity for compromise:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;His nature is too noble for the world:<lb/>
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,<lb/>
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:<lb/>
What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent,<lb/>
And, being angry, does forget that ever<lb/>
He heard the name of death&rsquo; (III, i, 313-318).<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>But Coriolanus' bearing to his friends and fellow officers scarcely supplies the
humanising touch which is necessary to any genuine sympathy with his fortunes.
The leavening current flows in its fulness from his relations with his family. His
patrician pride is the fruit of heredity. It is his mother's gift, and to her he is
bound by ties of affection as great in intensity as the less amiable traits of his
character. It is the conflict between his strong filial sentiment and his obstinate
antipathy to the democracy which induces sympathy with his fate and lends his
story its needful dramatic point. The pivot of Coriolanus' tragedy is the psycho-
logical struggle between the inflexible aristocratic sentiment which governs his
public life, and his sense of domestic obligation which is jeopardised by his public
action. Coriolanus' loving regard for his mother, Volumnia, is linked with con-
siderate gentleness of bearing towards his gracious, silent wife, Virgilia, and with
manly solicitude for their young son. A chivalric sentiment marks, too, his atti-
tude to his wife's confidante, Valeria. The distress which he causes his wife moves
him to his sole outburst of lyric emotion:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Best of my flesh,<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
Forgive my tyranny; but do not say,<lb/>
For that &ldquo;Forgive our Romans.&rdquo; O, a kiss<lb/>
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!<lb/>
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss<lb/>
I carried from thee, dear, and my true lip<lb/>
Hath virgin'd it e'er since&rsquo; (V, iii, 46-52).<lb/>
</hi>
A genuine paternal tenderness inspires his brief address to his son whose thoughts
he prays the god of soldiers to inform with nobleness:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;that thou mayst prove<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars<lb/>
Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw<lb/>
And saving those that eye thee!&rsquo; (V, iii, 80-83).<lb/>
</hi>
<pb n="684"/>
</p>
<p>Coriolanus' fall comes from his misapprehension of the relative force of his
private affections and of his public or political prejudices. In the crisis of his
fate, when the two influences are in direct conflict, his political pride wins the
first victory. It masters every opposing sentiment. He severs the domestic
as well as the patriotic tie. He will not be a gosling and obey instinct. He joins
the ranks of his country's foes, and threatens his countrymen, including his kindred,
with fire and sword. But the domestic sentiment, which he has suppressed, is
not extinguished. At a breath it revives to challenge to a fresh encounter his
political convictions, and in the end it scores a sweeping triumph. But the toils
of fate, which Coriolanus' stubborn and self-reliant egoism have already woven
about him, leave him at the close of the spiritual conflict no genuine loophole of
escape. His reawakened filial piety, which reunites him to his family and to his
countrymen, is not to be reconciled with the political obligations in which his
haughty spirit has involved him with his country's enemies. He is murdered as
a traitor by the Volscians, whom he had joined in order to avenge on his native
city the outrage which her democratic leaders had done his patrician pride.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>Critics have called Coriolanus a Tory or an
ultra-Tory. The tribune who calls him a &lsquo;traitorous innovator&rsquo; is quite as near
the mark. The people have been granted tribunes. The tribunate is a part of
the constitution, and it is accepted, with whatever reluctance, by the other
patricians. But Coriolanus would abolish it, and that not by law but by the
sword. Nor would he be content with that. The right of the people to control
the election of the consul is no new thing; it is an old traditional right; but it too
might well be taken away. The only constitution tolerable in his eyes is one where
the patricians are the state, and the people a mere instrument to feed it and fight
for it. It is this conviction that makes it so dangerous to appoint him consul,
and also makes it impossible for him to give way. Even if he could ask pardon
for his abuse of the people, he could not honestly promise to acknowledge their
political rights.</p>
<p>Now the nobleness of his nature is at work here. He is not tyrannical; the
charge brought against him of aiming at a tyranny is silly. He is an aristocrat.
And Shakespeare has put decisively aside the statement of Plutarch that he was
&lsquo;churlish, uncivil, and altogether unfit for any man's conversation.&rsquo; Shakespeare's
hero, though he feels his superiority to his fellow-patricians, always treats them as
equals. He is never rude or overbearing. He speaks to them with the simple
directness or the bluff familiarity of a comrade. He does not resent their advice,
criticism, or reproof. He shows no trace of envy or jealousy, or even of satisfaction
at having surpassed them. The suggestion of the tribunes that he is willing to
serve under Cominius because failure in war will be credited to Cominius, and
success in war to himself, shows only the littleness of their own minds. The
patricians are his fellows in a community of virtue&mdash;of a courage, fidelity, and
honour, which cannot fail them because they are &lsquo;true-bred,&rsquo; though the bright
ideal of such virtue become perfect still urges them on. But the plebeians, in
his eyes, are destitute of this virtue, and therefore have no place in this community.
All they care for is food in peace, looting in war, flattery from their demagogues;
and they will not even clean their teeth. To ask anything of them is to insult
not merely himself but the virtues that he worships. To give them a real share in
citizenship is treason to Rome; for Rome means these virtues. They are not
Romans, they are the rats of Rome.
<pb n="685"/>
</p>
<p>He is very unjust to them, and his ideal, though high, is also narrow. But he is
magnificently true to it, and even when he most repels us we feel this and glory
in him. He is never more true to it than when he tried to be false; and this is the
scene where his superiority in nobleness is most apparent. He, who had said of
his enemy, &lsquo;I hate him worse than a promise-breaker,&rsquo; is urged to save himself
and his friends by promises that he means to break. To his mother's argument
that he ought no more to mind deceiving the people than outwitting an enemy in
war, he cannot give the obvious answer, for he does not really count the people
his fellow-countrymen. But the proposal that he should descend to lying or
flattering astounds him. He feels that if he does so he will never be himself again;
that his mind will have taken on an inherent baseness and no mere simulated one.
And he is sure, as we are, that he simply cannot do what is required of him. When
at last he consents to try, it is solely because his mother bids him and he cannot
resist her chiding. Often he reminds us of a huge boy; and here he acts like a boy
whose sense of honour is finer than his mother's, but who is too simple and too
noble to frame the thought.</p>
<p>Unfortunately he is altogether too simple and too ignorant of himself. Though
he is the proudest man in Shakespeare he seems to be unaware of his pride, and
is hurt when his mother mentions it. It does not prevent him from being genuinely
modest, for he never dreams that he has attained the ideal he worships; yet the
sense of his own greatness is twisted round every strand of this worship. In almost
all his words and deeds we are conscious of the tangle. I take a single illustration.
He cannot endure to be praised. Even his mother, who has a charter to extol her
blood, grieves him when she praises him. As for others,
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun<lb/>
When the alarum were struck, then idly sit<lb/>
To hear my nothings monster'd.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
His answer to the roar of the army hailing him &lsquo;Coriolanus&rsquo; is, &lsquo;I will go wash.&rsquo;
His wounds are &lsquo;scratches with briars.&rsquo; In Plutarch he shows them to the people
without demur; in Shakespeare he would rather lose the consulship. There is a
greatness in all this that makes us exult. But who can assign the proportions of
the elements that compose this impatience of praise; the feeling (which we are
surprised to hear him express) that he, like hundreds more, has simply done what
he could; the sense that it is nothing to what might be done; the want of human
sympathy (for has not Shelley truly said that fame is love disguised); the pride
which makes him feel that he needs no recognition, that, after all, he himself could
do ten times as much, and that to praise his achievement implies a limit to his
power? If any one could solve this problem, Coriolanus certainly could not. To
adapt a phrase in the play, he has no more introspection in him than a tiger. So
he thinks that his loathing of the people is all disgust at worthlessness, and his
resentment in exile all a just indignation. So, too, he fancies that he can stand
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;As if a man were author of himself<lb/>
And knew no other kin,&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
while, in fact, public honour and home affections are the breath of his nostrils, and
there is not a drop of stoic blood in his veins.</p>
<p>What follows on his exile depends on this self-ignorance. When he bids farewell
to his mother and wife and friends he is still excited and exalted by conflict. He
comforts them; he will take no companion; he will be loved when he is lacked,
<pb n="686"/>

or at least he will be feared; while he remains alive they shall always hear from
him, and never aught but what is like him formerly. But the days go by, and no
one, not even his mother, hears a word. When we see him next he is entering
Antium to offer his services against his country. If they are accepted, he knows
what he will do: he will burn Rome.</p>
<p>As I have already remarked, Shakespeare does not exhibit to us the change of
mind which issues in this frightful purpose; but from what we see and hear later
we can tell how he imagined it; and the key lies in that idea of burning Rome.
As time passes, and no suggestion of recall reaches Coriolanus, and he learns what
it is to be a solitary homeless exile, his heart hardens, his pride swells to a moun-
tainous bulk, and the wound in it becomes a fire. The fellow-patricians from
whom he parted lovingly now appear to him ingrates and dastards, scarcely better
than the loathsome mob. Somehow, he knows not how, even his mother and
wife have deserted him. He has become nothing to Rome, and Rome shall hear
nothing from him. Here in solitude he can find no relief in a storm of words; but
gradually the blind intolerable chaos of resentment conceives and gives birth to
a vision, not merely of battle and indiscriminate slaughter, but of the whole city
one tower of flame. To see that with his bodily eyes would satisfy his soul; and
the way to the sight is through the Volscians. If he is killed the moment they
recognize him, he cares little; better a dead nothing than the living nothing Rome
thinks him. But if he lives, she shall know what he is. He bears himself among
the Volscians with something that resembles self-control; but what controls him
is the vision that never leaves him and never changes, and his eye is red with its
glare when he sits in his state before the doomed city.</p>
<p>This is Shakespeare's idea, not Plutarch's. In Plutarch there is not a syllable
about the burning of Rome. Coriolanus (to simplify a complicated story) intends
to humiliate his country by forcing on it disgraceful terms of peace. And this,
apart from its moral quality, is a reasonable design. The Romans, rather than
yield to fear, decline to treat unless peace is first restored; and therefore it will be
necessary to assault the city. In the play we find a single vague allusion to some
unnamed conditions which, Coriolanus knows, cannot now be accepted; but every-
where, among both Romans and Volscians, we hear of the burning of Rome, and
in the city there is no hope of successful resistance. What Shakespeare wanted
was a simpler and more appalling situation than he found in Plutarch, and a hero
enslaved by his passion and driven blindly forward. How blindly we may judge
if we ask the questions: what will happen to the hero if he disappoints the expecta-
tion he has raised among the Volscians, when their leader is preparing to accuse
him even if he fulfils it; and, if the hero executes his purpose, what will happen to
his mother, wife, and child; and how can it be executed by a man whom we know
in his home as the most human of men, a tender husband still the lover of his
wife, and a son who regards his mother not merely with devoted affection, but with
something like religious awe? Very likely the audience in the theatre was not
expected to ask these questions, but it was expected to see in the hero a man
totally ignorant of himself, and stumbling to the destruction either of his life or
of his soul.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote> Born of a haughty race, inheriting from his mother

recognized alike by high and low, have hardened the inborn pride and selfishness
of his nature, while no check to the supremacy of his class has come to teach him
the necessity of prudence and moderation. Thus, when he first appears before us,
the attitude of his mind is one of fierce astonishment that such scum as the people
should dare to complain even when starvation is staring them in the face. Rather
than give them relief he would meet their demand by wholesale butchery, and see
the city unroofed ere any privilege of appeal through representatives of their own
should be conceded by the patricians. That of creatures like these he should have
to ask a favour is to him a deep humiliation; that they should insist on the exercise
of any rights is something monstrous. In war they are scarcely better than beasts
of burden; in times of peace, mere machines for the use and convenience of the
nobles. So towering in his arrogance that he utterly fails to see the dangers he is
bringing down upon his own caste; so overweening his selfishness, and so vindictive
his hatred, that to avenge his own wrongs he will call in to the destruction of his
country the very foes whose conquest had won him his chief title to fame. That
the tribunes were but self-seeking demagogues is true enough. That the people
showed themselves fickle is, of course, patent. But the triumph of the former was
rendered possible by nothing else than his own infatuation; the defection of the
latter was courted by his cynicism. A very small stretch of good-will towards
them would have earned for him an idolatry as ungrudging as that with which he
was regarded by the patricians. Yet, with all his faults, his virtues were con-
spicuous. His services to his country had been many and great. In him heroism
and daring were surpassed not even by the demi-gods of Greece. To his freedom
from the vice which especially tainted the whole body of patricians, the vice of
grasping avarice, even the people he so hated bear willing witness. His gen-
erosity of nature shows itself in his refusal to enrich himself with the spoils of war
that are sought to be thrust upon him; his tenderness of heart in the remembrance
of the old man of Corioli in whose house he had found shelter, and in the considera-
tion which would soften his rejection of Menenius's prayer; his modesty, in the
aversion which ever shrank from all public eulogy; his warmth of affection by his
devotion to his mother and his wife. So endowed, he might not only have wielded
unique power, but wielded it to the highest interests of his country if his nobility
had not been neutralized by a pride Titanic in its measure, the source of his strength
converted into the source of his weakness. That in the end he should so far get
the better of it as to sacrifice himself for his country which he had served so well
and served so ill, shows him to us in a light which somewhat obscures the dark
spots that must ever rest upon his name and fame.</quote></cit></div2>

<p>Hotspur's parallel (perhaps slightly inferior artistically) is the Roman Coriolanus,
as brave, as violent, and as disdainful as he, a despiser of the people and of the
people's praise; he too rushes over the precipice to death and is also a &lsquo;formal&rsquo;
hero, because his bravery is not founded upon love of country, or upon a faith or
ideal of any kind, one might almost say that it was without object or that its
object was itself. Nor, on the other hand, is Coriolanus a superman in the sense
suggested by the works of some of the predecessors and contemporaries of Shake-
speare. He is not less tenderly demonstrative towards his mother or his silent

prayers, he stays the course of his triumphant vengeance. . . . The marvelous
Hotspur appears in the play in order that he may confirm the glory of youthful
Prince Hal, that is to say, that he may provide a curious anecdote of what was or
appeared to be the scapegrace youth of a future sage sovereign; that is, he is not
fully represented. Coriolanus runs himself into a blind alley; and even if the poet
portrays with historical penetration the patricians and plebeians of Rome, it
would be vain to seek in the play for the centre of gravity of his feelings, of his
predilections, or of his aspirations, because both Coriolanus, the tribunes, and his
adversaries are looked upon solely as characters, not as parts and expressions of a
sentiment that should justify one or other or both groups.</p></quote></cit></div2></div1>

<quote><p>In Volumnia Shakspeare has given us the portrait of
a Roman matron, conceived in the true antique spirit, and finished in every part.
Although Coriolanus is the hero of the play, yet much of the interest of the action
and the final catastrophe turn upon the character of his mother, Volumnia, and
the power she exercised over his mind, by which, according to the story, &lsquo;she saved
Rome and lost her son.&rsquo; Her lofty patriotism, her patrician haughtiness, her
maternal pride, her eloquence, and her towering spirit are exhibited with the
utmost power of effect; yet the truth of female nature is beautifully preserved,
and the portrait, with all its vigour, is without harshness.</p>
<p>I shall begin by illustrating the relative position and feelings of the mother
and son, as these are of the greatest importance in the action of the drama and,
consequently, most prominent in the characters. Though Volumnia is a Roman
matron, and though her country owes its salvation to her, it is clear that her
maternal pride and affection are stronger even than her patriotism. Thus, when
her son is exiled, she bursts into an imprecation against Rome and its citizens:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,<lb/>
And occupations perish!&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>Here we have the impulses of individual and feminine nature overpowering all
national and habitual influences. Volumnia would never have exclaimed like the
Spartan mother, of her dead son, &lsquo;Sparta has many others as brave as he&rsquo;; but in
a far different spirit she says to the Romans,
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Ere you go, hear this;<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
As far as doth the Capitol exceed<lb/>
The meanest house in Rome, so far my son,<lb/>
Whom you have banished, does exceed you all.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>In the very first scene, and before the introduction of the principal personages,
one citizen observes to another that the military exploits of Marcius were per-
formed not so much for his country's sake &lsquo;as to please his mother.&rsquo; By this ad-
mirable stroke of art, introduced with such simplicity of effect, our attention is
aroused, and we are prepared in the very outset of the piece for the important
part assigned to Volumnia, and for her share in producing the catastrophe.</p>
<p>In the first act we have a very graceful scene, in which the two Roman ladies,
<pb n="689"/>

the wife and mother of Coriolanus, are discovered at their needlework, conversing
on his absence and danger, and are visited by Valeria.</p>
<p>Over this little scene Shakspeare, without any display of learning, has breathed
the very spirit of classical antiquity. The haughty temper of Volumnia, her
admiration of the valour and high bearing of her son, and her proud but unselfish
love for him, are finely contrasted with the modest sweetness, the conjugal tender-
ness, and the fond solicitude of his wife, Virgilia. Thus when the victory of
Coriolanus is proclaimed, Menenius asks, &lsquo;Is he wounded?&rsquo;

<hi rend="blockquote">
<quote><l>&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Virgilia.</hi> O no, no, no!</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Volumnia.</hi> Yes, he is wounded&mdash;I thank the gods for it!&rsquo;</l>
</quote>
</hi>

And when he returns victorious from the wars his high-spirited mother receives
him with blessings and applause&mdash;his gentle wife with &lsquo;gracious silence&rsquo; and with
tears.</p>
<p>The resemblance of temper in the mother and the son, modified as it is by the
difference of sex and by her greater age and experience, is exhibited with admir-
able truth. Volumnia, with all her pride and spirit, has some prudence and self-
command; in her language and deportment all is matured and matronly. The
dignified tone of authority she assumes towards her son when checking his head-
long impetuosity, her respect and admiration for his noble qualities, and her strong
sympathy even with the feelings she combats, are all displayed in the scene in
which she prevails on him to soothe the incensed plebeians.</p>
<p>When the spirit of the mother and the son are brought into immediate collision,
he yields before her; the warrior who stemmed alone the whole city of Corioli,
who was ready to face &lsquo;the steep Tarpeian death, or at wild horses' heels,&mdash;vaga-
bond exile&mdash;flaying,&rsquo; rather than abate one jot of his proud will&mdash;shrinks at her
rebuke. The haughty, fiery, overbearing temperament of Coriolanus is drawn
in such forcible and striking colours that nothing can more impress us with the
real grandeur and power of Volumnia's character than his boundless submission
to her will&mdash;his more than filial tenderness and respect.</p>
<p>When his mother appears before him as a suppliant, he exclaims,
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;My mother bows;<lb/>
As if Olympus to a molehill should<lb/>
In supplication nod.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
Here the expression of reverence, and the magnificent image in which it is clothed,
are equally characteristic both of the mother and the son.</p>
<p>Her aristocratic haughtiness is a strong trait in Volumnia's manner and char-
acter, and her supreme contempt for the plebeians, whether they are to be defied
or cajoled, is very like what I have heard expressed by some high-born and high-
bred women of our own day. And in her speech to the gentle Virgilia, who is
weeping at her husband's banishment,
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Leave this faint puling! and lament as I do,<lb/>
In anger&mdash;Juno-like!&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
But the triumph of Volumnia's character, the full display of all her grandeur of
soul, her patriotism, her strong affections, and her sublime eloquence, are reserved
for her last scene, in which she pleads for the safety of Rome, and wins from her
angry son that peace which all the swords of Italy and her confederate arms could
not have purchased. The strict and even literal adherence to the truth of history
is an additional beauty.
<pb n="690"/>
</p>
<p>It is an instance of Shakspeare's fine judgment, that after this magnificent and
touching piece of eloquence, which saved Rome, Volumnia should speak no more,
for she could say nothing that would not deteriorate from the effect thus left on
the imagination. She is at last dismissed from our admiring gaze amid the thunder
of grateful acclamation&mdash;
<hi rend="blockquote">&lsquo;Behold our patroness,&mdash;the life of Rome.&rsquo;</hi></p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Volumnia is a superb figure
indeed, yet a genuine woman throughout, though with a high strain of what
may be called manliness pervading her womanhood. She has all of her son's
essential strength and greatness of character, and is nearly as proud withal as
he; but her pride has a much less individual and unsocial cast; he is the chief
matter of her pride, while self is the chief matter of his; she is proud of him too, far
more for her country's sake than either for his or her own; her supreme ambition
is that he should be the greatest among the Romans; and she would have his
greatness stand in being more a Roman than any of the others. Hence her pride
flames out in fierce resentment at the sentence of exile; her maternal heart boils
over with passion, insomuch that to those who are nowise in sympathy with her
anger she seems insane; and she bangs away at the Tribunes with the wildest
notes of imprecation; then hotly remonstrates against the quiet weeping grief
of her daughter-in-law. Against the people also she goes into a lingual tempest,
and speaks as if she would gladly see Rome burnt, since Rome rejects her heart's
idol; but the sequel shows this to be all because she is so intensely Roman in
spirit; when things come to the pinch, her actions speak quite another language;
and she is as far from sympathizing with her son in his selfish vindictiveness as
she had been from sympathizing with the people's madness in banishing him.
That a Roman should fight his way to the highest honours in Rome is just what
she believes in, but that he should fight for any thing but Rome is beyond her
conception. So, when she sees her son waging war against his country, where his
home and all its treasures are, she considers him to have renounced the only cause
for fighting at all. It seems to her that he is making war against the one sole
object or end of war; and she will rather disclaim her part in him than take part
with him; nay, will rather die with Rome than see him grow by the death of that
for which alone, in her view, a Roman should wish to live.</p>
<p>As the mother's pride is tempered by a more disinterested and patriotic spirit
than the son's, so she holds a much more firm and steady course; her words, in
moments of high resentment, fly about wildly indeed, but her heart sticks fast to
its cherished aims. And her energy of thought and purpose, if not greater than
her son's, yet in the end triumphs over his, because it proceeds on grounds less
selfish and personal. She knows and feels that the gods are with her in it. The
Poet wisely, and out of his own invention, represents her as exhorting him to tem-
porize with the people, and to use arts for conciliating them which have no allow-
ance in his bosom's truth. For even so, like a true woman, as she is, she &lsquo;would
dissemble with her nature, where her fortune and her friends at stake requir'd
she should do so in honour.&rsquo; To her sense and judgment of things deeds are to
be weighed more by their ends and effects in regard of others than by their intrinsic
quality to the doer's mind; that is, a man should act rather with a view to help
and gladden and comfort those about him, to serve his country and his kind, than
to feed his moral egotism, or any sullen pride or humour of self-applause. It is
even a rule of honour with her that a man should, in his action, be more considerate
<pb n="691"/>

of what will further the welfare and happiness of others than of what will please
himself, or accord with any inward or ideal standard of his own. And so it is
rightly in woman's nature, as being less wilful and more sympathetic in her reason,
to judge of actions mainly by the practical consequences which she hopes or fears
therefrom; I mean the consequences not only or chiefly to herself, but to those
whom she loves. Therefore it is that women have so often been peace-makers in
men's wars of opinions and passions and ideas; and I know not what would become
of human society if their softer bosom did not come in to mitigate the sharpness
of the brain.</p>
<p>Volumnia, though something more admirable than lovely in her style, is a
capital representative of the old Roman matronly character, in which strength
and dignity seem to have had rather the better of sweetness and delicacy, but which
enshrined the very soul of rectitude and honour. And what a story does the life
of this mother and this son, with their reciprocal action and influence as set forth
in the play, tell us of the old Roman domestic system, and of the religious awe of
motherhood which formed so large and powerful an element in the social con-
stitution of that wonderful people! What a comment, too, does all this, taken
together with the history of that nation, read upon the Divine precept, &lsquo;Honour
thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord
thy God giveth thee!&rsquo; For reverence of children to their parents is the principle
that binds together successive generations in one continuous life.</p></quote></cit></div2>

the end of the life of Coriolanus. Shakspere was evidently struck by them, for
he has transcribed them almost literally in Act V, sc. iii, merely bringing them into
the measure of blank verse, giving them the ring of spoken, not written, words,
and here and there adding or strengthening an expression.</p>
<p>The chief points which we notice in them are a deep love of her country; an
intense affection for the person addressed; a jealous care for his honour, and an
evident knowledge that he too is most sensitive about it; great personal dignity,
and an imperative claim for reverence based on her motherhood; all which is
expressed with fire and eloquence, moderated and held in check by self-control
and common sense. . . . But although the outlines of her character are to be
found in Plutarch, the touches and details which give it life remind us of great
English ladies, such as Shakspere must have met by the time he wrote this play.
. . . To this day Volumnias are not by any means uncommon in England, espe-
cially in periods of national struggle and danger, combining with great pride of
place an intense devotion to their country, to which they will sacrifice not only
their pride, but the family ties which are yet dearer to their women's hearts. In
this she is unlike her son, for while her love of country is the one thing that rivals
her love for him, he is rather devoted to his order, and, when rewarded for his
services with ingratitude, can sacrifice even that order to his revenge.</p>
<p>Of her parentage, girlhood, and marriage nothing whatever is told us; we only
know that she was a widow, and that Marcius was her eldest and only surviving
<pb n="692"/>

son, for she calls him &lsquo;my first son&rsquo; and, again, &lsquo;my only son.&rsquo; As to her husband
we merely hear that he was of a noble house, distinguished for the services it had
done for Rome. Whether Volumnia wedded him for love, or in obedience to her
parents, whether she mastered him, or he her, there is no word to tell us. The
reason of this is not that Plutarch is silent on the subject, for, as we shall presently
see, Shakspere gives us a clear insight into her relations with her daughter-in-law,
of which there is no hint in the life, but because Volumnia is one of those women
the strongest, deepest feelings of whose natures are knitted up with the instinct,
the passion of motherhood. Thus it by no means follows that Volumnia was not
a happy wife, but her supreme affection was for her son, and it became all the
stronger as being a widow there were no conflicting claims upon her.</p>
<p>Her life was devoted to make her boy worthy of the high-minded patriots from
whom he sprang; both by precept and example she taught him that courage and
endurance were a duty, and especially that valour which, when Rome was struggling
for existence with the nations around, was naturally held to be &lsquo;the chiefest virtue&rsquo;
which &lsquo;most dignifies the haver.&rsquo; Neither did her great love lead her to neglect to
discipline the boy; even when he is a grown man she exacts a reverence, an abso-
lute obedience from him, which he, whose nature revolted from all control, would
only have paid her from having been accustomed to do so from his earliest childhood.</p>
<p>We are led to suppose that had she willed she might have married again, for
she says of herself as an additional claim to his obedience: &lsquo;and she, poor hen,
fond of no second brood&rsquo;; but she preferred to remain merely the mother of Corio-
lanus, and to make his glory her crown as well as his. Thus she grew to old age,
and he to middle life, repaying her great devotion with an affection and reverence
which became the common talk of Rome; the very poorest knew that the chief
joy he took in his great exploits was the pleasure they brought his mother, and
on his return home hers was the face he first looked for to welcome him.</p>
<p>Where, then, was the fatal mistake which rendered his many good qualities of
no avail? It is shown in the first scene in which she appears, where we see her
sewing at home with her daughter-in-law, Coriolanus himself being absent at the
wars. In Virgilia Shakspere has provided Volumnia with a good dramatic contrast.
She is one of those quiet, gentle, persistent women with whom we often meet, who
seem all submission, but who in the long run mostly get their own way. Indeed,
only such a nature could possibly have lived with two fiery, masterful beings like
her husband and his mother, without being either entirely crushed, or the occasion
of terrible strife. The rough Coriolanus loves her well; he calls her &lsquo;My gracious
silence&rsquo;; her calmness was doubtless very restful to him; influence over him she
had but little; he had been accustomed to look to his mother as the only judge of
his actions, and she still remained so, but to Volumnia Virgilia was an irritating
daughter-in-law; there were an infinity of small matters over which their wills
clashed, and such a nature as Volumnia's would have far preferred an open quarrel,
which would have cleared the air like a thunderstorm, and in which she would
have been likely to triumph, to the persistent, dutiful opposition which it was
Virgilia's policy and nature to make. Then again the hardy old lady, to whom
war and bloodshed were the highest form of glory, could not understand, much
less tolerate, Virgilia's shrinking from the very thought of danger; we shall find
examples of both causes of difference in the present scene. The two women were
not in sympathy; but by this time all trials of strength were over between them.
Volumnia was too large minded to make petty quarrels, and too just not to give
her daughter-in-law the place due to her in public; notice how she puts her forward,
<pb n="693"/>

and lets her walk first in the procession which goes to implore mercy for Rome.
Virgilia, on the other hand, had a good temper and great forbearance, and, too
wise to attempt a fruitless struggle for domination, was content to carry her point
in things appertaining to herself. . . . For her most dear country Volumnia is
even ready to give the life of her only son, whom she cannot speak of to Virgilia
as &lsquo;thine&rsquo; without adding &lsquo;and my good Marcius.&rsquo; Notice too her passionate
nature and poetical mind, which make all her arguments word-pictures; we can
almost see the beautiful boy whom she sent forth to war and danger. We find the
same authoritative manner, the same fervid nature and vivid eloquence inherited
by Coriolanus:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Hang 'em. They say!<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know<lb/>
What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,<lb/>
Who thrives and who declines; side factions and give out<lb/>
Conjectural marriages; making parties strong<lb/>
And feebling such as stand not in their liking<lb/>
Below their cobbled shoes.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
It is like a picture of Teniers; we see the poor folk crouching round the fire in their
well-worn shoes. But with Marcius we feel that he is not using his qualities, but
they are running away with him, while all Volumnia's powers are disciplined and
controlled. There is never a word too much, even when she feels most strongly;
when she speaks it is to the purpose, and at the right time. . . . By nature very
like her son, Volumnia's position as woman, wife, and mother has forced self-
control upon her; and this, combined with her fiery impulsiveness, is one of the
secrets of her strength of character and of the influence she exercises over him.
The one giving her power and energy, the other allowing her to see where it
should be employed; and even in the present scene we have an example of this.
Hastily leaving what she perceives is a dangerous subject, Valeria begs the two
ladies to go with her to visit a mutual friend, but Virgilia refuses; in vain does
Valeria tease and persuade; in vain does Volumnia cry imperiously, &lsquo;She shall, she
shall!&rsquo; Virgilia will courteously endure the presence of her mother-in-law's friends,
but to gad about Rome in her lord's absence is quite against her ideas of what is
becoming in a wife; she is gentle as ever, but quite immovable. &lsquo;Indeed, I must
not,&rsquo; she says; &lsquo;I wish you much mirth.&rsquo; Volumnia does not break out in angry
exaggerated speech at this opposition, as her son would have done; she thinks it
absurd and is annoyed, but she wastes no useless words, and only saying, &lsquo;Let her
alone, lady; as she is now she will but disease our better mirth,&rsquo; she goes forth
alone with Valeria. . . . Volumnia's first scene chiefly deals with her upbringing
of Coriolanus; we see her in her domestic and heroic aspect; the second contains
the outpouring of her mother-love, and joy in her son's success, which are strong
and full of fire in proportion to her impetuous, vigorous character. Though
determinately cheerful in the absence of her &lsquo;boy,&rsquo; as, mother-like, she still calls
the great warrior, the news of his approach sends her into a fever of delight and
excitement, showing how keen had been her anxiety and suffering while he was
away, and now with Valeria and Virgilia she rushes to the gates to greet him. . . .
Volumnia has now, as it is given to few to do, &lsquo;seen inherited&rsquo; the &lsquo;very wishes
and buildings&rsquo; of her fancy; but the one thing wanting is to be denied her, and she
now enters on a period of clouds and sorrow. The election of Coriolanus has been
lost by his own unbridled folly; a tumult has followed, and he has been dragged
<pb n="694"/>

away to be protected from the fury of the mob. A band of sympathizing friends
have followed him home, and he is now angrily proclaiming to them his determi-
nation of never submitting to his adversaries; but he speaks with the exaggerated
emphasis of one who feels his cause a bad one, for the disapproval of his mother
has already shaken his resolution.</p>
<p>And here we meet with another grave error in Volumnia's education of her son.
With all her love for &lsquo;our Rome&rsquo; she has a hearty contempt for her inferiors; she
was wont
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;To call them wollen vassals, things created<lb/>
To buy and sell with groats.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
And her son has learnt the lesson but too well; that part of his speech in Act I,
sc. i, which has been already quoted, is a mere reproduction of the ideas he now
recalls. But her pride of place has no personal dislike of those below her associated
with it; thus she cannot only lay it aside when necessary, but has a real affection
for them as her countrymen. With Coriolanus, the tendency of whose mind it is
to exaggerate every impression he receives, it has become an intense abhorrence
of the plebeians, finding expression in the grossest insolence and intolerance, and
making him quite unfit for the work life brought him to do. Volumnia has learnt,
by the mere fact of belonging to the weaker sex, that what we would have in this
world we must often gain by tact; while Marcius has fallen into the not uncommon
habit of natures disliking the effort of self-control, that of salving his conscience
after an outbreak of temper by calling indulgence in it, honesty, and the expression
of every feeling, no matter how discourteous or impolitic, truth. To her the com-
mon sense of putting your power well on before you have worn it out is so evident
that she is filled with impatience, and she expresses it openly; but having done so
she holds her peace; she is not one of those nagging women who return again and
again to a subject when nothing is to be gained by insistence on it; and at this
moment the friends who are praising her son for his folly are stronger than she is.
When, however, Menenius and the senators enter to persuade him to return and
mend the evil he has done, she at once supports them, and Menenius, knowing
that their best hope of success is in her influence, in his turn supports her.</p>
<p>This scene is most significant not only of the great power which Volumnia
possesses over her stiff-necked son, but of the kind of arguments which touch him.
It is the forerunner of that in which by her prayers she saves Rome, from which
indeed it probably originates, as the two scenes have much in common, and this
may have been introduced to make us realize the extent of her influence over him,
so that his final yielding to her petitions may not seem unnatural. There is a
regular plan in her attack; she says no word about his duty to his country, which
is one of her main arguments in her last great appeal to him; he is not now in a
humour for it to have weight with him; but first she reasons, cutting from under
his feet every inch of ground on which he would be likely to make a stand, laying
especial stress on the fact that what she desires cannot hurt his honour. It is a
point on which he is most sensitive, and we learnt from her first scene that she
had brought him up to be so; and to Marcius honour meant not only the fulfilment
of duty, but that renown for which he lived, and anything that touched it was at
once resented by him. . . . She speaks boldly; no woman who was afraid of
Coriolanus could have lived with him; she reminds him that persistence in his
present course risks not merely his own safety, but that of his party and his
family. Then, as he shows by his silence that she is making an impression on
<pb n="695"/>

him, dropping her tone of rebuke, she tells him how he must bear himself to the
plebeians, unpleasant though she knows her words will be. The very form of her
speech, &lsquo;I pri'thee,&rsquo; from one so unused to beg, shows us she is asking a great and
hard thing. Still no answer; she fears that obstinacy may be taking possession of
him, and, partly, woman-like, that she may commit him in spite of himself, partly
to silence the doubt so unwisely thrown on his obedience by Cominius, she says
in her old tone of command: &lsquo;He must, and will. Pri'thee now, say you will, and
go about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He responds to the voice he has never yet disobeyed, but with such a loathing
for his new part as augurs ill for his success in playing it, and his mother now
prays him with the utmost tenderness: &lsquo;I pri'thee now, sweet son,&rsquo; enforcing her
argument by calling to his mind her share in building up his greatness. But to
take this tone was, she finds, a mistake; Coriolanus is in no mood for softness,
and that she should use it to beg a favour from him, shows him she knows how
hard a thing she is asking him to do; it only increases his distaste for the task,
and he stormily refuses to perform it, on the excuse of self-respect. Then, feeling
the greatness of the occasion, Volumnia takes the last arrow out of her quiver.
She is rarely angry, even under provocation, and prefers as a rule to concede a
point rather than fight for it; but she possesses that valuable weapon of some strong,
self-controlled natures, a temper which is so held in check that she can suppress
or let it go at will. Such natures have all the flash and fury of anger, but reason
lies in ambush to direct their use, and the extreme rarity of the outburst con-
vinces its object that his antagonism is in such tremendous earnest that the effect
is irresistible. In the present instance Volumnia suddenly turns on her son, and
roundly chides him for failing in his duty and dishonouring her by refusing her
prayer, and bidding him do his will, and bring ruin and death on her and on the
city, she concludes with the reproach:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,<lb/>
But owe thy pride thyself.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
Her displeasure conquers him at once, and in hurried apologetic sentences, most
unlike the usual utterances of the haughty Coriolanus, he promises obedience.
She is too wise to diminish the effect of her rebuke by forgiving him at once, and
she passes out with a curt &lsquo;Do your will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>We next see Volumnia at the pathetic leave-taking of Coriolanus; the utter
failure of all her high hopes has broken down even her courage; she clings to her
son with bitter tears, while he, their parts reversed for the first time, supports
and comforts her. He checks Virgilia's lamentations with the sharpness born of
pain, but to his mother he is all gentleness. Even when she curses those who have
treated him with such ingratitude, and he might be expected to launch out into
invective, he only soothes and stops her. The dignified patience and sweetness
which he now shows leads us to think that with a different rearing his faults might
not have so obscured his finer qualities. He goes on his way, and the women are
returning home under the care of Menenius, when they meet the tribunes; at
the sight of them Volumnia breaks out in curses and loud-voiced abuse. Only
now do we see how much alike the characters of this mother and son really are.
Naturally hot-tempered, and prone to speak out all that is in her mind, the agony
at her heart breaks down the power of self-control which she could only have ac-
quired by long self-discipline, while the very sense that all is over, and that tact
and patience can no longer help her son, drive her into this tempest of anger. Com-
<pb n="696"/>

pare the restrained fire of her chiding of Coriolanus with her present wild and
whirling words, and we shall see the difference between the passion which is allowed
by the will to show itself, and that which bursts forth overthrowing all restraints.
Compare also the states of mind of which these scenes are the outcome. In the
one her whole energy is directed to persuade her son to retrieve the false step he
has made; she feels a little impatience, but her anger is merely the instrument with
which she effects her purpose. Now the knowledge that she is impotent to help
her boy out of the ruin he has brought on himself, produces a physical as well as
mental oppression which she must relieve, and had she not met the tribunes she
would have vented her rage and pain on some one else. The tension of her nerves
is such that everything is an offence, and she even quarrels with Virgilia for her
natural tears. Poor old Menenius stands by her as he did beside her son, trying
in vain to moderate her wrath and to prevent her from bringing destruction, like
him, upon her head. . . .</p>
<p>Throughout the early part of Act V, sc. iii. Volumnia's natural affection for
her son is struggling for the mastery, while she represses it with an iron hand,
determined to play her part in the wisest and most tactful way for gaining her
object. Had she not withheld her usual loving greeting; had she not, as it were,
kept him at a distance, he would have been far less likely to grant her request,
but though she does it willingly for Rome, it costs her much. Another cause
makes her manner more formal and artificial than in her previous scene of remon-
strance with him, until she is carried away by the strength of her own appeal.
She comes as the ambassadress of Rome, and she speaks with the dignity befitting
her office. . . .</p>
<p>A horrible fear takes possession of her; will he, who never refused her anything,
deny her prayer? and she cries in sudden apprehension, &lsquo;Speak to me, son.&rsquo; She
waits in breathless suspense for a reply, and then continues in vehement appeal to
his nobler nature: &lsquo;Thou has affected the fine strains of honour.&rsquo; Still no answer,
and in a passion of despair she cries: &lsquo;Why dost not speak? Think'st thou it
honourable for a noble man still to remember wrongs?&rsquo; She calls to Virgilia, to
the child, to aid her, and then with a sudden flash of anger:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;There's no man in the world<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
More bound to's mother; yet here he lets me prate<lb/>
Like one i' the stocks.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
And in grand indignation:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Say my request's unjust,<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,<lb/>
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,<lb/>
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which<lb/>
To a mother's part belongs&mdash;He turns away.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
It is a cry of agony; her last chance is slipping from her; she turns to her followers:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Down, ladies, let us shame him with our knees.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
Country and honours, argument and indignation have been of no avail; if he can
resist her self-abasement all is over; for a moment she thinks he is yielding, and
points to the unconscious supplicating boy, but the father's face hardens, and
with a burst of anger she too is turning away when he catches her by the hand,
and she knows that the same plan of attack which drove him out to humble him-
<pb n="697"/>

self before the tribunes, has given her her triumph. He holds her hand a moment
before he speaks:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;O my mother, mother! O!<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
You have won a happy victory to Rome;<lb/>
But, for your son,&mdash;believe it, O, believe it,<lb/>
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,<lb/>
If not most mortal to him.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
And Volumnia answers not a word; too well she knew that when she begged mercy
for her country she devoted her only son to death; neither when the populace
receive her on her return with shouts of joy and gratitude can she respond; she
feels she has lost her one son, and that the voices which shout her welcome are
those which hounded him to his death. She has made the greatest of all sacrifices
for her country; and just as she would not show her anxiety when her Marcius was
at the wars, so now she hides her pain and goes home to weep.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>Coriolanus' mother, Volumnia,
is as vivid and finished a picture as the hero himself. Her portrait, indeed, is
a greater original effort, for it owes much less to Plutarch's inspiration. Volumnia
is a proud, high-souled, strong-willed, shrewd-witted matron, amply endowed with
maternal feeling. From her Coriolanus derives alike his patrician prejudice and
his military ambition. She has firm faith in hereditary rank and birth. Trade
or manual labour is in her view degrading. When her son suffers sentence of
banishment from plebeian lips her resentment finds characteristic expression in
the imprecation, &lsquo;Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome and occupa-
tions perish.&rsquo; Military glory colours her conception of manly virtue, and she values
it highest in her own kindred. She inured her son, her only child, in boyhood to
hardy soldiership. With justice she tells him, &lsquo;My praises made thee first a
soldier; Thy valiantness is mine; thou suck'dst it from me.&rsquo; She rejoices in the
wounds with which in manhood he returns from battle. &lsquo;She (poor hen!) fond
of no second brood cluck'd him to the wars, and safely home, loaden with honour.&rsquo;
There is no hesitation about her admiration of his prowess. He is to other Roman
citizens &lsquo;like the Capitol to the meanest house&rsquo; in the city. Though Coriolanus
is impatient of his mother's spoken praises, he rejoices in her approval, and there
is some foundation for the citizens' taunt that he performs his military exploits
&lsquo;to please his mother.&rsquo; Her courage, too, is no wit inferior to his. She mocks at
death with as big a heart as he.</p>
<p>But in one regard Volumnia is greater than her stubborn heir. The keenness
and pliancy of her intellect have no counterpart in his nature. In spite of the
warmth of her affection, she is fully alive to his defects of reason, on which she
comments with a mother's frankness and a worldly philosopher's penetrating irony.
These are some of the biting rebukes she addresses to him:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;You might have been enough the man you are,<lb/>
With striving less to be so&rsquo; (III, ii, 24, 25).<lb/>
&lsquo;I have a heart as little apt as yours,<lb/>
But yet a brain, that leads my use of anger<lb/>
To better vantage&rsquo; (III, ii, 38-40).<lb/>
&lsquo;I would dissemble with my nature, where<lb/>
My fortunes and my friends at stake, required<lb/>
I should do so in honour&rsquo; (III, ii, 79-81).<lb/>
</hi>
<pb n="698"/>
</p>
<p>There is no narrowness, no pettiness in Volumnia's moral or mental constitution.
Misfortune increases her moral and mental stature. There is no faint puling about
her griefs. In anger she is Juno-like. When adversity compels her to present
herself to her son in a foreign camp as a suppliant in behalf of the Roman people,
her words acquire a logical cogency and rhetorical splendour which entitles her
eloquence, for all its debt to Plutarch, to rank with Mark Antony's oration at
C&aelig;sar's funeral. Her tongue is innocent of the garrulity of age. She knows the
season of silence no less than that of speech, and it is dramatically fitting that
after the eloquent appeal to her son, whereby she saves Rome and with unconscious
irony seals his ruin, no further word in the scenes that follow should escape her lips.</p>
<p>Very artistically are the other female characters of the tragedy, Coriolanus'
wife, Virgilia, and Virgilia's friend, Valeria, presented as Volumnia's foils. Valeria
is a high-spirited and honourable lady of fashion, with a predilection for frivolous
pleasure and easy gossip. Virgilia is a gentle wife and mother, who fully deserves
Coriolanus' apostrophe of &lsquo;gracious silence.&rsquo; She speaks little, and her husband's
military adventures only excite her fears for his personal safety. She greets with
tears his return home in triumph, whereby she earns the scorn of her brave and
resolute mother-in-law. The three characters amply testify to the dramatist's
knowledge of the varieties of the female temper.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Though this play is by no means a drama
of destiny, we might almost say that Volumnia is responsible for the hero's life
and death. She trained him from the first to aim at honour in arms, to despise
pain, and to
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;forget that ever<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
He heard the name of death&rsquo;;<lb/>
</hi>
to strive constantly to surpass himself, and to regard the populace with inhuman
disdain as
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;things created<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
To buy and sell with groats.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
Thus she led him to glory and to banishment. And it was she who, in the hour
of trial, brought him to sacrifice his pride and his life.</p>
<p>Her sense of personal honour we saw was less keen than his, but she was much
more patriotic. We feel this superiority even in the scene that reveals the defect;
in her last scene we feel it alone. She has idolized her son; but, whatever motive
she may appeal to in her effort to move him, it is not of him she thinks; her eyes
look past him and are set on Rome. When, in yielding, he tells her that she has
won a happy victory for her country, but a victory most dangerous, if not most
mortal, to her son, she answers nothing. And her silence is sublime.</p>
<p>These last words would be true of Plutarch's Volumnia. But in Plutarch, though
we hear of the son's devotion, and how he did great deeds to delight his mother,
neither his early passion for war nor his attitude to the people is attributed to
her influence, and she has no place in the action until she goes to plead with him.
Hence she appears only in majesty, while Shakespeare's Volumnia has a more
varied part to play. She cannot be majestic when we see her hurrying through
the streets in wild exultation at the news of his triumph; and where, angrily con-
quering her tears, she rails at the authors of his banishment she can hardly be
called even dignified. What Shakespeare gains by her animation and vehemence
in these scenes is not confined to them. He prepares for the final scene a sense of
contrast which makes it doubly moving and impressive.
<pb n="699"/>
</p>
<p>In Volumnia's great speech he is much indebted to Plutarch, and it is, on the
whole, in the majestic parts that he keeps most close to his authority. The open
appeal to affection is his own; and so are the touches of familiar language. It is
his Volumnia who exclaims, &lsquo;here he lets me prate like one i' the stocks,&rsquo; and who
compares herself, as she once was, to a hen that clucks her chicken home. But
then the conclusion, too, is pure Shakespeare; and if it has not majesty it has
something dramatically even more potent. Volumnia, abandoning or feigning to
abandon hope, turns to her companions with the words:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Come, let us go:<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;<lb/>
His wife is in Corioli, and his child<lb/>
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch;<lb/>
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,<lb/>
And then I'll speak a little.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
Her son's resolution has long been tottering, but now it falls at once. Throughout,
it is not the substance of her appeals that moves him, but the bare fact that she
appeals. And the culmination is that she ceases to appeal, and defies him. This
has been observed by more than one critic. I do not know if it has been noticed
that on a lower level exactly the same thing happens where she tries to persuade
him to go and deceive the people. The moment she stops, and says, in effect,
&lsquo;Well, then, follow your own will,&rsquo; his will gives way. Deliberately to set it against
hers is beyond his power.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Volumnia is the Roman patrician and the Roman mother.
The reverence of Coriolanus for her is a record of the ancient Roman honour for
the ties of home, especially for motherhood. She is not only a mother; she is as
much a patrician as her son, but without his furious temper; on the contrary, with
a good share of politic prudence. She has the faults of her class and her position,
otherwise she is a noble woman. These faults are, however, too much for her
womanly tenderness and for her honour. Her honour slips away when she ad-
vises Coriolanus to deceive the people in order to get the counsulship. He is true,
and he resents giving the lie to his nature. She excuses the fraud by the practice
of war. It is lawful to deceive an enemy, and to her the people are the foe. As to
her tenderness, she has it for her son and friends, but it is tenderness modified by
the hunger for fame, for glory in war. The thoughtless militarism which has in
all ages infected her class has made her its victim. She loves to see her son's wounds
which tell of his might and bravery. She has no care for the wounds of his men, for
the wretched people who are victimized to make the fame of her son. She boasts
in a terrible phrase of the terror and woe he causes. The trumpets sound as he re-
turns. &lsquo;These,&rsquo; she cries, &lsquo;are the ushers of Marcius: before him he carries noise,
and behind him he leaves tears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When we come to the close relationship between her son and her we come to a
serious study. They stand together in an inner circle, isolated, as it were, from the
rest. When the political interest, even when the fate of Coriolanus, in the play
are dimmed in memory, the mother and the son still dwell in our thoughts. Their
relationship is the inmost heart of the drama, where the deepest affections play.
The love that is between them glorifies them, and creates round the haughty woman
and the terrible warrior the gracious atmosphere of home. We retire, from time to
time, from the noise of Rome and Volscian wars into an island of domestic peace
<pb n="700"/>

and steady affection of which Volumnia and Coriolanus are the source. Virgilia
sits and sews, Volumnia talks to her of her husband and her own son; the boy
plays in the garden; Valeria drops in to gossip; and here Coriolanus&mdash;his violence
and pride lost in his reverence and love of his mother who admires and loves him,
and herself in him&mdash;finds his better self. Not till he is divided from his mother is
he lost. The mother lives in the son. She has made him from his birth; both of
them dwell on that long education. The son is the mother in a man. His fighting
is what she would have done had she been a man. Had she been the wife of Her-
cules she would have taken half his labours on herself. Her pride in her class is
his. And his scorn of the people is hers.</p>
<p>Her love of fame has been his inspiration. Every charge he has made on the
enemies of Rome, every wound he has received have been made and received with
the voice of his mother in his ears; and she has, in thought and admiration, made
the charges and received the wounds. &lsquo;O! he is wounded; I thank the gods
for't,&rsquo; she cries, when he comes home from Corioli. For his glory she has lived.
One honour yet remains&mdash;he must be consul.</p>
<p>They stand apart and together. The honour we give to the son we give also to
the mother, who is its source. The pity we finally give to the son in his ruin we
give in fuller stream to the mother.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Of the subordinate persons, by far the most imposing
and influential is Volumnia, the great-hearted mother, the patrician lady, the Roman
matron. The passion of maternity, whether interpreted as maternal love or as
maternal pride, penetrates her nature to the core, not, however, to melt, but to
harden it. In her son's existence she at first seems literally wrapped up, and she
implies that devotion to him rather than to her dead husband has kept her from
forming new ties. . . . Marcius is thus the only son of his mother and she a widow;
but these reminiscences show how strictly the tenderness, and still more the in-
dulgence, usual in such circumstances, have been banished from that home.
In Plutarch the boy seeks a military career from his irresistible natural bent. . . .
In Shakespeare the direction and stimulus are much more directly attributed to
his mother, and it is she who first despatches him to the field. This she herself
expressly states in her admonition to Virgilia. . . . Indeed it is easy to see that
for good and evil he is what she has made him. She is entitled to say:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Thou art my warrior:<lb/>
I holp to frame thee.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
And though elsewhere she puts it,
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst from me,<lb/>
But owe thy pride thyself&rsquo; (III, ii, 156, 157),<lb/>
</hi>
the impartial onlooker cannot make the distinction. He is bone of her bone and
blood of her blood; and all her master impulses reappear in him, though not so
happily commingled or in such beneficent proportion. The joint operation is
different and in some respects opposite, but there is hardly a feature in him that
cannot be traced to its origin in Volumnia, whether by heredity or education.
This is just what we might expect. Modern conjecture points to the mother rather
than the father as the source of will-power and character in the offspring; and in
the up-bringing of the boy Volumnia has had it all her own way. Plutarch, as
we saw, in his simple fashion notices this as a disadvantage; and though we may
be sure that Plutarch's insinuation of laxity could never be breathed against
<pb n="701"/>

Shakespeare's Volumnia, still she could not give her son more width and flexibility
than her own narrow and rigid ideals enjoined. Moreover, her limitations when
transferred to the larger sphere of his public efforts would cramp and congest his
powers and displace his interests.</p>
<p>Nor was there any other agency to divide the young man's allegiance to his
mother or to counteract or temper her authority. Generally the most powerful
rivals of home influence are the companionship of friends, and the love that founds
a new home in marriage. But both of these are either wanting in Coriolanus'
life, or serve only to deepen the impressions made on him by Volumnia.</p></quote></cit></div2></div1>

<quote> You will observe the good nature with
which Shakespeare seems always to make sport with the passions and follies of a
mob, as with an irrational animal. He is never angry with it, but hugely content
with holding up its absurdities to its face; and sometimes you may trace a tone
of almost affectionate superiority, something like that in which a father speaks
of the rogueries of a child. See the good-humored way in which he describes
Stephano passing from the most licentious freedom to absolute despotism over
Trinculo and Caliban. The truth is, Shakespeare's characters are all genera
intensely individualized; the results of meditation, of which observation supplied
the drapery and the colors necessary to combine them with each other. He had
virtually surveyed all the great component powers and impulses of human nature&mdash;
had seen that their different combinations and subordinations were, in fact, the
individualizers of men, and showed how their harmony was produced by reciprocal
disproportions of excess or deficiency. The language in which these truths are
expressed was not drawn from any set fashion, but from the profoundest depths of
his moral being, and is, therefore, for all ages.</quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> If we observe closely, we cannot even find that the people
are here represented as so very bad. We must distinguish between the way in
which they really act and the way in which the mockers and despisers of the people
represent them; we may then soon find that the populace in <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar</hi> appear
much worse than in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi> Great attention is here paid to the character of
the age. In <hi rend="italic">Antony,</hi> where the people had ceased to be of any importance, they
no longer appear; in <hi rend="italic">C&aelig;sar,</hi> where their degeneracy ruined the republic, they are
shown in all their weakness; in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> where they can oppose but not stop the
progress of Rome's political career, they appear equally endowed with good and
bad qualities. We must allow that the populace are not flattered. The multitude
are not alone blamed by Coriolanus as inconstant and variable, but they make
him conscious of their changeableness by their behaviour concerning his election.
Not alone does Menenius say that their imprudence &lsquo;transports them by calamity
thither where more attends them,&rsquo; but we find them actually on this road, and
their leaders surpass them in popular frenzy; what is inconvenient, is not believed,
and is concealed from the people, and the messenger is flogged who brings the
unwelcome truth. It is true they are not alone reproached by words with unjustly
ascribing to the government what is perhaps the decree of Providence, that they
curse the justice that overtakes the criminal, and persecute the great with hatred;
<pb n="702"/>

we see them ourselves in action, now loving and now hating without a reason, and,
as it always happens in stirring times, scattering abroad the exciting common-
places which have much show and little truth. Coriolanus despises all the deeds
and capacity of the people, which &lsquo;where it should find lions, finds hares,&rsquo; but the
poet has actually shown us their cowardice and their love of plunder. On the
other hand, we must not be, like Coriolanus, unreasonable, and overlook the fact
that Shakespeare has introduced some better and braver among the people, who,
when the general calls for volunteers, all shout and follow him, to his great joy
and admiration. We must not omit to observe that the whole mass of the people
acknowledge the merit of Coriolanus, that the zeal to admire and applaud the con-
queror is universal, that his party among the people seems very great, that even
the inflamed and excited people acknowledge that he is not avaricious, that he is
not more proud than brave; that, with regard to his haughtiness, they take into
consideration the power of his nature, and acknowledge that his merit surpasses
their power to recompense. Menenius imagined that if the nobles did not keep
them in awe they would destroy themselves, yet they acknowledge readily the
wisdom of his fable, before which their wisdom yields. The friends of Coriolanus
expected that the people, when left to themselves on his banishment, would fall
into confusion, but, to their surprise, peace and union prevail. If fickleness be
the attribute of the populace in all ages, there is an advantage even in this fault,
which is totally opposed to the stiff obstinacy of the aristocrat; the populace be-
come, through this quality, a manageable mass, which a wise man, like Menenius,
can easily guide; if it be easily inflamed, it is also easily calmed again, and this
quality of ready forgiveness Menenius himself praises in the people. Their hostility
against Coriolanus is excusable on account of his indifference and haughty contempt, and on account of the scorn and enmity with which the proud man inten-
tionally challenges their hatred.</p>
<p>Here, in fact, the good and bad qualities of the multitude are weighed truly,
and even with moderation. If, however, we would find out the poet's estimation of
democratic and aristocratic principles, we must, as we intimated above, compare
the highest representative of both principles, Coriolanus, with Brutus and Cassius;
not the populace with Coriolanus, who is intended by the poet, expressly and in
accordance with history, to tower, like a hero, above them. We might compare
this character with Marlowe's transcendent heroes, if Shakespeare's exaggeration
were intended for genuine nature, and our admiration claimed in good faith,
as is the case in similar descriptions of the old school of poetry; whereas with him,
on the contrary, this outdoing of nature breaks to pieces of itself as something
unnatural, and leaves in the observer a very mixed feeling.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> In <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> the people have a larger share in the action
than in either of the other Roman plays.</p>
<p>The cardinal point to be noticed first of all is that Shakespeare makes no dis-
tinction between the plebeians of the early Republic and the populace of imperial
and degenerate Rome. For this Plutarch is certainly not responsible, for although
he is not in his heart very favourably disposed towards the &lsquo;common people,&rsquo;
as North calls them, he does justice on various occasions to their military courage
and even to their civic virtues, noticeably at the time of their withdrawal to the
&lsquo;Holy Hill,&rsquo; when they offered &lsquo;no creature any hurt or violence, nor made any
show of actual rebellion.&rsquo; Here they remained for four months. Right and reason
were on their side, and they dishonoured their cause by no act of violence or excess
<pb n="703"/>

of any kind. To these oppressed and proud plebeians, opposing a passive and
what may be called a conservative resistance to the despotic measures of the
patricians, with a moderation derived from a sense of their strength and the right-
fulness of their cause, it is impossible to refuse our esteem, nay more, our admira-
tion. Nothing could less resemble a vulgar street riot than this orderly retreat
to Mons Sacer of four thousand resolute men, ready to suffer anything rather than
submit to tyranny. By the firmness of their attitude they compelled the senate to
give way, for the land was lying uncultivated, and the inaction of four thousand
valiant defenders, as Plutarch acknowledges them to be, left Rome exposed to the
attacks of her foes. The chatter of poor old Menenius, and his wonderful fable,
had but slight effect upon the seceders, who were only induced to return to their
homes after obtaining the privilege of appointing tribunes &lsquo;to defend the poor
people from violence and oppression.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This aspect of the plebeians of the Roman Republic in its young days, this grave,
political, warlike, and wholly estimable side of their nature, does not appear in
<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi> According to his invariable custom, Shakespeare took no heed of what
he considered to be a mere historical peculiarity, a local and temporary exception;
he depicts the plebeians, in the early times of liberty, in conformity with the
general type he had conceived of the populace, a type belonging to no especial
date of nationality, but eternally and everlastingly true, and as applicable to
ancient Rome as to Paris or London in modern times&mdash;to the Republic and the
Empire, as to periods of absolute or constitutional monarchy, or as to our own
democratic days. The dominant features of Shakespeare's plebeians, as of all his
sons of the people, are stupidity, inconstancy, and cowardliness. They are always
blundering, always incapable of any political idea, and impressionable as wax in
the hands of their demagogues. To these vices must be added their feeble negative
good qualities, which may be summed up shortly by saying that they are even sillier
than they are wicked.</p>
<p>If <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> were an historical or political drama, and if the struggle between
the plebeians and the patricians were what Shakespeare intended to depict, as
has so often been foolishly said, it must be allowed that he has scarcely carried
out his purpose in a satisfactory manner; for no attempt is made to give to each of
the rival pretensions of the two hostile factions whatever portion of truth it may
contain, or even to state clearly what they are. This contest between two political
ideas, brought into harmony by a chorus of old men endowed with rather greater
wisdom than Menenius Agrippa, would have furnished a magnificent subject to
the Sophoclean drama. Nor would a poet, who like Corneille was fond of political
dissertations, have failed to put an eloquent vindication of the rights of the people
into the tribune's mouth. But Shakespeare leaves all this side of the matter
entirely in the shade. The plebeians would appear to have no solid foundation
for their grievances, nor are we even able to perceive what benefit they expect from
the establishment of the tribuneship, nor why, when their petition is granted them,
it should throw them into such a rapturous state, shouting with joy, and throwing
their caps &lsquo;as they would hang them on the horns o' the moon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the truth is, that the interest of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is anything but of a political or
historical order; it is on the character of the hero, on the development of his nature,
that the poet has concentrated all the effort of his genius: he pictures him as a
giant of passion and pride, towering over the heads of all who surround him, who,
with the single exception of his mother, are utterly insignificant, weak, and con-
temptible. Without going so far as to say, with Hallam and Gervinus, that there
<pb n="704"/>

was no other possible treatment of the subject, it is enough to state that this
is the manner in which Shakespeare has treated it, and which is fully in accordance
with the admiration for great personalities and strongly-marked characters which
his writings so often testify. He has sacrificed in one huge holocaust nearly all
the other personages of the drama, that he might add to the colossal proportions
of the patrician and warrior. To form any notion of the distance that separated
Coriolanus from the plebeians, of the remote spot whence he surveyed them and
was dismayed, as it were, at their smallness, we must turn to medi&aelig;val times, and
picture to ourselves a knight equipped for battle giving orders from horseback to
his churls and serfs: his intense contempt is simply inconceivable at a time when
all citizens were on a footing of military equality. But, in fact, we are not in Rome
at all, we are in the full stream of chivalry, with the warlike nobles on the one
side and on the other the peasants that dig the ground.</p>
<p>These flights of fancy in the Shakespearian drama rather interfere with our
comprehension of the logical sequence of the facts; it is difficult to understand, if
we stop to consider, how much such utterly contemptible creatures as the plebeians
and their tribunes are represented to be, should all at once become powerful enough
to dictate laws to the nobles, and to banish their great enemy. But the vigour
of the poetry carries the reader along with it, and leaves no time or space for the
cold objections of historical accuracy. <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is, at one and the same time, the
play in which Shakespeare has borrowed from the historian the greatest number
of details which he reproduces with peculiar exactitude, and also that in which he
has most widely departed from the spirit of historical truth.</p>
<p>The part played by the plebeians in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> must, therefore, be regarded
merely as a representation of the populace in general; and it is, moreover, the best
portrait of the kind given by Shakespeare, the shadows are not painted in so deep a
hue as elsewhere, and one or two redeeming features possible to the picture are
pleasantly brought forward.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Shakespeare's aristocratic contempt for the mob had its
root in a purely physical aversion for the atmosphere of the &lsquo;people.&rsquo; We need but
to glance through his works to find the proof of it. In the Second Part of <hi rend="italic">Henry VI.</hi>
(Act IV, sc. vii.) Dick entreats Cade &lsquo;that the laws of England may come out of
his mouth&rsquo;; whereupon Smith remarks aside: &lsquo;It will be stinking law; for his breath
stinks with eating toasted cheese.&rsquo; And again in Casca's description of C&aelig;sar's
demeanour when he refuses the crown at the Lupercalian festival: &lsquo;He put it the
third time by, and still he refused it; the rabblement hooted and clapped their
chapped hands, and threw up their sweaty nightcaps, and uttered such a deal of
stinking breath because C&aelig;sar refused the crown, that it had almost choked C&aelig;sar;
for he swooned and feel down at it; and for mine own part, I durst not laugh for
fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air&rsquo; (<hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar,</hi> Act I, sc. ii.).</p>
<p>Also the words in which Cleopatra (in the last scene of the play) expresses her
horror of being taken in Octavius C&aelig;sar's triumph to Rome:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Now, Iras, what thinkest thou?<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown<lb/>
In Rome as well as I: mechanic slaves,<lb/>
With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall<lb/>
Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,<lb/>
Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclosed<lb/>
And forced to drink their vapour.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
<pb n="705"/>
</p>
<p>All Shakespeare's principal characters display this shrinking from the mob,
although motives of interest may induce them to keep it concealed. When
Richard II., having banished Bolingbroke, describes the latter's farewell to the
people, he says (<hi rend="italic">Richard II.,</hi> Act I, sc. iv.):
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green,<lb/>
Observed his courtship to the common people;<lb/>
How he did seem to dive into their hearts<lb/>
With humble and familiar courtesy,<lb/>
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles<lb/>
And patient underbearing of his fortune,<lb/>
As 'twere to banish their effects with him.<lb/>
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench,<lb/>
A brace of draymen bid God-speed him well,<lb/>
And had the tribute of his supple knee,<lb/>
With &ldquo;Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends.&rdquo;&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>The number of these passages proves that it was, in plain words, their evil
smell which repelled Shakespeare. He was the true artist in this respect too, and
more sensitive to noxious fumes than any woman. At the present period of his
life this particular distaste has grown to a violent aversion. The good qualities
and virtues of the people do not exist for him; be believes their sufferings to be
either imaginary or induced by their own faults. Their struggles are ridiculous to
him, and their rights a fiction; their true characteristics are accessibility to flattery
and ingratitude towards their benefactors; and their only real passion is an innate,
deep, and concentrated hatred of their superiors; but all these qualities are merged
in this chief crime: they stink.
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> For the mutable rank-scented many, let them<lb/>
Regard me as I do not flatter, and<lb/>
Therein behold themselves&rsquo; (Act III, sc. i.).<lb/>

Were he to stand for consul, never would he<lb/>

The napless vesture of humility;<lb/>
Nor, showing as the manner is, his wounds<lb/>
To the people, beg their stinking breaths&rsquo; (Act II, sc. i.).<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>When Coriolanus is banished by the people he turns upon them with the out-
burst:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate<lb/>
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize<lb/>
As the dead carcases of unburied men<lb/>
That do corrupt my air&rsquo; (Act II, sc. iii.).<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>When old Menenius, Coriolanus's enthusiastic admirer, hears that the banished
man has gone over to the Volscians, he says to the People's Tribunes:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;You have made good work,<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
You and your apron-men: you that stood so much<lb/>
Upon the voice of occupation and<lb/>
The breath of garlic-eaters!&rsquo; (Act IV, sc. vi.).<lb/>
</hi>
<pb n="706"/>
</p>
<p>And a little farther on:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Here come the clusters.<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
And is Aufidius with him? You are they<lb/>
That made the air unwholesome when you cast<lb/>
Your stinking greasy caps up, hooting at<lb/>
Coriolanus' exile.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>If we seek to know how Shakespeare came by this non-political but purely
sensuous contempt for the people, we must search for the reason among the ex-
periences of his own daily life. Where but in the course of his connection with
the theatre would he come into contact with those whom he looked upon as human
vermin? He suffered under the perpetual obligation of writing, staging, and acting
his dramas with a view to pleasing the Great Public. His finest and best had
always most difficulty in making its way, and hence the bitter words in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>
about the &lsquo;excellent play&rsquo; which &lsquo;was never acted, or, if it was, not above once;
for the play, I remember, pleased not the million.&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>A theatrical audience of those days was, to Shakespeare's eyes at any rate, an
uncultivated horde, and it was this crowd which represented to him &lsquo;the people.&rsquo;
He may have looked upon them in his youth with a certain amount of goodwill
and forbearance, but they had become entirely odious to him now. It was un-
doubtedly the constant spectacle of the &lsquo;understanders,&rsquo; and the atmosphere of
their exhalations, which caused his scorn to flame so fiercely over democratic
movements and their leaders, and all that ingratitude and lack of perception which,
to him, represented &lsquo;the people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With his necessarily slight historical knowledge and insight Shakespeare would
look upon the old days of both Rome and England in precisely the same light in
which he saw his own times. His first Roman drama testifies to his innately anti-
democratic tendencies. He seized with avidity upon every instance in Plutarch
of the stupidity and brutality of the masses. Recall, for example, the scene in
which the mob murders Cinna, the poet, for no better reason than its fury against
Cinna, the conspirator (<hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar,</hi> Act III, sc. iii.). . . .</p>
<p>This point of view meets us again and again in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus;</hi> and whereas, in his
earlier plays, it was only occasionally and, as it were, accidentally expressed, it
has now grown and strengthened into deliberate utterance.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> It is no doubt true that this and many other Shakespearian
plays abound in hostile or scornful vituperation of the people; and not only of their
moral and mental demerits; their sweaty clothes, their rank breaths, their gross-
ness and uncleanness are held up to derision and execration. But are we to at-
tribute these sentiments to Shakespeare? Such utterances are ex hypothesi
dramatic, and show us merely the attitude of the speakers, who are without excep-
tion men of the opposite camp or unfriendly critics. Only once does Shakespeare
give his personal or, rather, impersonal estimate. It is in the Induction to the
second part of <hi rend="italic">Henry IV.,</hi> when Rumour, whose words, in this respect at least,
cannot be influenced by individual bias, speaks of
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;the blunt monster of uncounted heads,<lb/>
The still-discordant, wavering multitude&rsquo; (line 18).<lb/>
</hi>
That is, the populace as a whole is stupid, disunited, fickle. And this is how, apart
from the exaggerations of their opponents, Shakespeare invariably treats crowds
of citizens, whether in the ancient or modern world. He therefore with perfect
<pb n="707"/>

consistency regards them as quite unfit for rule, and when they have it or aspire
to it, they cover themselves with ridicule or involve themselves in crime. But
this is by no means to hate them. On the contrary, he is kindly enough to indi-
vidual representatives, and he certainly believes in the sacred obligation of govern-
ing them for their good. Where then are the governors to be found? Shakespeare
answers: in the royal and aristocratic classes. It is the privilege and duty of
those born in high position to conduct the whole community aright. Shakespeare
can do justice to the Venetian oligarchy and the English monarchy. But while to
him the rule of the populace is impossible, he also recognizes that nobles and
kings may be unequal to their task. The majority of his kings indeed are more or
less failures; his nobles&mdash;and in this play, the patricians&mdash;often cut a rather sorry
figure. In short, popular government must be wrong, but royal or aristocratic
government need not be right.</p>
<p>And this was exactly what historical experience at the time seemed to prove.
The Jacqueries, the Peasants' Wars, the Wat Tyler or Jack Cade Insurrections,
were not calculated to commend democratic experiments; and, on the other hand,
the authority of king and nobles had often, though not always, secured the welfare
of the state.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> The representation of the people, whatever
else it may be, is part of a dramatic design. This design is based on the main
facts of the story, and these imply a certain character in the people and the hero.
Since the issue is tragic, the conflict between them must be felt to be unavoidable
and well-nigh hopeless. The necessity for dramatic sympathy with both sides
demands that on both there should be some right and some wrong, both virtues
and failings; and if the hero's monstrous purpose of destroying his native city is
not to extinguish our sympathy, the provocation he receives must be great. This
being so, the picture of the people is, surely, no darker than it had to be; the desired
result would have been more easily secured by making it darker still. And one
must go further. As regards the political situation the total effect of the drama,
it appears to me, is this. The conflict of hero and people is hopeless; but it is he
alone who makes the conflict of patricians and plebeians, I do not say hopeless,
but in any high degree dangerous. The people have bad faults, but no such faults
as, in his absence, would prevent a constitutional development in their favour.</p>
<p>I will try to describe their character, but I will illustrate this statement by
comparing two accusations of their opponents with the facts shown; for these we
must accept, but the accusations we must judge for ourselves. In the first scene
the people are called cowards both by the hero and by their friendly critic Menenius.
Now there is no sign that they possess the kind of courage expected of gentlemen,
or feel the corresponding shame if their courage fails. But if they were cowards
how could Rome be standing where we see it stand? They are the common soldiers
of Rome. And when we see them in war what do we find? One division, under
Cominius, meets the Volscians in the field; the other, under Coriolanus, assaults
Corioli. Both are beaten back. This is what Cominius says to his men:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Breathe you, my friends: well fought: we are come off<lb/>
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,<lb/>
Nor cowardly in retire.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
Nothing hints that the other division has not fought well or was cowardly in retire;
but it was encouraged beforehand with threats, and, on its failure, with a torrent
<pb n="708"/>

of curses and abuse. Nevertheless it advances again and forces the enemy to
the gates, which Coriolanus enters, calling on his men to follow him.
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">First Sol.</hi> Fool-hardiness; not I.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Second Sol.</hi> Nor I.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">First Sol.</hi> See, they have shut him in.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">All.</hi> To the pot, I warrant him.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>Disgusting, no doubt; but the answer to threats and curses. They would not
have served Cominius so; and indeed, when Lartius comes up and merely sug-
gests to them to &lsquo;fetch off&rsquo; the reappearing hero, they respond at once and take
the city. These men are not cowards; but their conduct depends on their leaders.
The same thing is seen when Coriolanus himself appeals to the other division for
volunteers to serve in the van. For once he appeals nobly, and the whole division
volunteers.</p>
<p>Another charge he brings against the people is that they can neither rule nor
be ruled. On this his policy of &lsquo;thorough&rsquo; is based. Now, judging from the
drama, one would certainly say that they could not rule alone&mdash;that a pure
democracy would lead to anarchy, and perhaps to foreign subjection. And one
would say also that they probably could not be ruled by the patricians if all
political rights were denied them. But to rule them, while granting them a place
in the constitution, would seem quite feasible. They are, in fact, only too easy
to guide. No doubt, collected into a mob, led by demagogues, and maddened by
resentment and fear, they become wild and cruel. It is true, also, that, when their
acts bear bitter fruit, they disclaim responsibility and turn on their leaders: &lsquo;that
we did, we did for the best; and though we willingly consented to his banishment,
yet it was against our will.&rsquo; But they not only follow their tribunes like sheep;
they receive abuse and direction submissively from any one who shows goodwill.
They are fundamentally good-natured, like the Englishmen they are, and have a
humorous consciousness of their own weaknesses. They are, beyond doubt,
mutable, and in that sense untrustworthy; but they are not by nature ungrateful,
or slow to admire their bitterest enemy. False charges and mean imputations
come from their leaders, not from them. If one of them blames Coriolanus for
being proud, another says he cannot help his pride. They insist on the bare form
of their right to name him consul, but all they want is the form, and not the whole
even of that. When he asks one of them, &lsquo;Well then, I pray, your price of the
consulship?&rsquo; the answer, &lsquo;The price is to ask it kindly,&rsquo; ought to have melted at
once; yet when he asks it contemptuously it is still granted. Even later, when
the arts of the tribunes have provoked him to such a storm of defiant and revolu-
tionary speech that both the consulship and his life are in danger, one feels that
another man might save both with no great trouble. Menenius tells him that the
people
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;have pardons, being ask'd, as free<lb/>
As words to little purpose.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>His mother and friends urge him to deceive the people with false promises. But
neither false promises nor apologies are needed, only a little humanity and some
acknowledgment that the people are part of the state. He is capable of neither,
and so the conflict is hopeless. But it is not because the people, or even the tri-
bunes, are what they are, but because he is what we call an impossible person.
<pb n="709"/>
</p>
<p>The result is that all the force and nobility of Rome's greatest man have to be
thrown away and wasted. That is tragic; and it is doubly so because it is not only
his faults that make him impossible. There is bound up with them a nobleness of
nature in which he surpasses every one around him.</p>
<p>We see this if we consider, what is not always clear to the reader, his political
position. It is not shared by any of the other patricians who appear in the drama.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Of Shakespeare's politics, in the
narrower sense of the term, there should be little need to speak. All Englishmen
under Elizabeth had much the same politics. But it has become the fashion lately
to judge Shakespeare by our modern democratic and philanthropical ideas and
to find him sadly wanting. We are asked, Is it not true that he despised the
general mass of the people? Was he not specifically middle-class, with the char-
acteristic reverence of that class for an aristocracy? Does he anywhere show
interest in the poor, until indeed he came to write <hi rend="italic">King Lear,</hi> when such interest
had begun to be popular? Let me answer these questions as shortly as I can.
Creizenach points out that Shakespeare was the first dramatist to bring crowds
on to the stage; and indubitably, when he does so, he shows them to be at the
mercy of the demagogues who play upon their cupidity, as they always were, and
still are. To Shakespeare, as to Chaucer, they are
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;The stormy people, unsad and ever untrue,<lb/>
Ay indiscreet, and changing as a vane.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
But he shows them to be as responsive to good influence as to bad when they
find a leader whom they respect and in whom they have confidence. There is a
good instance in the insurrection scene in Sir Thomas More, which Sir E. Maunde
Thompson's investigation of Shakespeare's handwriting permits us now to attribute
decidedly to Shakespeare. Further, it must be observed that Shakespeare recog-
nizes the shrewdness and common sense, and also the magnanimity, of individuals
among them. In the scene where the Roman people, one by one, promise Corio-
lanus their votes for the consulship, the good feeling and also the good manners
are on their side, not his. In regard to the second question, when it is implied
that Shakespeare takes no interest in the simple lives and doings of honest, humble
folk, does not this mean merely that honest humble folk are, as such, naturally
wanting in dramatic interest? Moreover, on a stage like Shakespeare's, where it
is character that is of moment, rather than manners, distinctions of class count for
little, and in Illyria and the forest of Arden they become very shadowy. But when
humility and poverty are of dramatic importance, as in the case of Helen in <hi rend="italic">All's
Well that Ends Well,</hi> we find that Shakespeare comes out as the champion of the
humble and meek. It would hardly be possible to find a more emphatic repudia-
tion of the aristocratic claim that noble blood is the sole title to social recognition
than Shakespeare puts into the mouth of the Countess of Rousillon, the old lord
Lafeu, and even the King of France himself:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Strange is it that our bloods,<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,<lb/>
Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off<lb/>
In differences so mighty. . . .<lb/>
Honours thrive<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
When rather from our acts we them derive<lb/>
Than our foregoers.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
<pb n="710"/>
</p>
<p>As to Shakespeare's alleged indifference to the poor before the date of <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>
(1606), I can see no reason for thinking that the references to their hard condition
in that play are other than dramatic. They are perfectly natural, one might even
say obvious, in the mouth of a king reduced to equality with a beggar. There is
no evidence that they represent, as has been said, &lsquo;a swift response&rsquo; on the drama-
tist's part to a new spirit of Philanthropy in his patrons. Indeed, if it were so,
Shakespeare's response was not only swift but short-lived, for we find no further
references of the sort in later plays. No one can say that Shakespeare may not,
while he was writing <hi rend="italic">King Lear,</hi> have come across some hard case which specially
appealed to him; but the problem of pauperism had been before people's minds
all through Elizabeth's reign, and by her third Poor Law it was thought to be
satisfactorily settled.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> It is surely not against the
democratic idea that Coriolanus is tried and found wanting. In spite of Signor
Croce's assurance to the contrary, it is impossible to believe that the contempt for
the city mob with which the play is penetrated was not shared by Shakespeare him-
self. The greatest writers strive to be impersonal, and, on the whole, they achieve
impersonality; but, though they carve out an image that is unlike themselves,
they cannot work wholly against the grain of their own convictions. Prejudice
will out. And the loathing of the city mob which is continually expressed in
Shakespeare's work and comes to a head in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> was indubitably his own.
It is indeed less plausible to deny this than it would be to argue that at a time when
his genius was seizing on themes of a greater tragic scope it was his sympathy with
the anti-plebeian colour of the Coriolanus story that led Shakespeare to choose it
for his play.</p>
<p>This is not a question of Shakespeare's political views. We do not know what
they were, and we have no means of finding out. Signor Croce is thus far right.
But when he goes on to assure us that it is a wild-goose-chase to look to discover
where Shakespeare's sympathies lay in the world in which he lived, we can but
point to the knowledge we actually have of every great writer. We do know their
sympathies. It may be an illegitimate knowledge, but the laws it violates are
laws of Signor Croce's own devising. It is his own logical fiat that holds the king-
doms of the &aelig;sthetic and the practical asunder. In fact, there is no dividing-line
between them. A writer's predispositions in practical life do constantly deter-
mine his &aelig;sthetic creation, and every great writer who has been conscious of his
activity has either confessed it or gloried in it.</p>
<p>We know that Shakespeare detested the city mob. If we care to know why we
have only to exercise a little imagination and picture to ourselves the finest creative
spirit in the world acting in his own plays before a pitfull of uncomprehending
base mechanicals:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Alas, 'tis true, I have gone here and there<lb/>
And made myself a motley to the view,<lb/>
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>The man who used that terrible phrase, who &lsquo;gored his own thoughts&rsquo; to wring
shillings from the pockets of the greasy, grinning crowd in front of him, had no
cause to love them; and Shakespeare did not. He was an aristocrat, not in the
political sense, but as every man of fine mind who shrinks from contact with the
coarse-minded is an aristocrat, as Anton Tchehov was an aristocrat when he wrote:
<pb n="711"/>

&lsquo;Alas, I shall never be a Tolstoyan! In women I love beauty above all things,
and in the history of mankind, culture expressed in carpets, spring carriages, and
keenness of wit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Shakespeare could not, therefore, measure Coriolanus against the democratic
idea in which he could not believe; nor could he pit the patriotic idea against him,
for Coriolanus was immune from a weakness for his country. It is domestic love
that pierces his armour and inflicts the mortal wound.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Certain ideas were linked in Shakespeare's mind,
and this coupling recurs with a curious similarity in spite of differing circum-
stances: at one time it may be in an elaborate simile; at another, in a single line
or even word. Thus the idea that adversity tests character as a tempest tests
ships is expressed by Coriolanus in twenty words, by Nestor (naturally) in nearly
as many lines. So, too, Macbeth echoes Richard III.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the speech of Sir Thomas More be Shakespeare's, we may reason-
ably expect More's figures regarding government to reappear (changed to suit the
speaker's circumstances) in those passages in Shakespeare's undoubted works
where this question of authority and mob-law is discussed. Such passages are
the speech of Ulysses in <hi rend="italic">Troilus</hi> and several scenes in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi></p>
<p>If authority be impaired, there can be no end short of men devouring one
another like ravenous fishes or beasts of prey. So Coriolanus thinks:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,<lb/>
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,<lb/>
Make yourselves scabs? . . . Your affections are<lb/>
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that<lb/>
Which would increase his evil. . . . What's the matter,<lb/>
That in these several places of the city<lb/>
You cry against the noble senate, who,<lb/>
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else<lb/>
Would feed on one another?&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
If Marcius had been able to make his language a little more conciliatory, he would
have spoken exactly like Sir Thomas More:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Grant . . . that you sit as kings in your desires,<lb/>
Authority quite silenced by your brawl,<lb/>
And you in ruff of your opinions clothed,<lb/>
What had you got? I'll tell you: you had taught<lb/>
How insolence and strong hand should prevail,<lb/>
How order should be quelled; and by this pattern<lb/>
Not one of you should live an aged man.<lb/>
For other ruffians, as their fancies wrought<lb/>
With self same hand, self reasons, and self right,<lb/>
Would shark on you, and men like ravenous fishes<lb/>
Would feed on one another,&rsquo; [<hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas More,</hi> Addition II, 195-210].<lb/>
</hi>
The language of Coriolanus leaps over stages of thought, as we expect that of any
angry man to do, let alone an angry man in one of Shakespeare's later plays. But
the thought which is explicit in More's speech is implicit in that of Coriolanus, and
leads them both to their conclusion in this identical figure involving an identical
half-line.
<pb n="712"/>
</p>
<p>Even in his ridicule of humble folk Shakespeare generally shows a loving touch.
The keen sympathy of Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch has taught us to see this even in
Stephano, &lsquo;in extremity to be counted on for the fine confused last word of our
mercantile marine, &ldquo;Every man shift for all the rest.&rdquo;&rsquo; And all must agree with
Walter Bagehot that Shakespeare was &lsquo;sympathizingly cognizant with the talk of
the illogical classes.&rsquo; If Hippolyta is bored by Bottom and his company, and can-
not conceal her impatience, Shakespeare did not expect us to see them with her
eyes. The story of <hi rend="italic">Much Ado,</hi> as Shakespeare found it, was one in which all the
actors belonged to gentle circles, and the solution came from the confession of one
or other of the courtly culprits. Shakespeare added Dogberry, Verges, and the
Watch. He delighted in them; and in the hands of the absurd Watch of Messina
he placed the detection of the plot which had deceived all the nobles, and against
which even Beatrice could suggest no better remedy than &lsquo;Kill Claudio.&rsquo; Further,
Shakespeare's love of irony has led him to arrange the order of events, so as to
bring Leonato face to face with Dogberry and the detected plot before the wed-
ding. If Leonato, instead of dismissing Dogberry as &lsquo;tedious,&rsquo; had possessed
Shakespeare's &lsquo;kindly fellow-feeling for the narrow intelligence necessarily induced
by narrow circumstances,&rsquo; he would have saved himself considerable trouble at
the expense of wrecking the catastrophe of the play.</p>
<p>Despite anything the gentles may say, we love Bottom and we love Dogberry;
even Carlyle so far overcame his dislike of fools as to love Dogberry. Yet when,
instead of &lsquo;Dogberry&rsquo; or &lsquo;Bottom,&rsquo; we read &lsquo;1st Citizen,&rsquo; or &lsquo;2nd Citizen,&rsquo; we are
very prone to see them, if not with the eyes of Coriolanus, at any rate of a patrician
partizan. And it must be granted that in <hi rend="italic">2 Henry VI.</hi> the picture is partizan; the
crowd is foolish and murderous. Yet even here the touches which are most
Shakespearian are precisely those which are least venomous.</p>
<p>We may admit that Shakespeare hated and despised the tribunes in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>
with a bitterness which he rarely felt towards any of his creatures. And we may
admit (with reservations) that in Shakespeare &lsquo;when a &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; is mentioned, he
generally does or says something absurd.&rsquo; But Shakespeare did not dislike absurd
people, and demonstrably he did not dislike the mob in <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi></p>
<p>We must remember that the plebeians as a whole (apart from the tribunes)
never have a chance of seeing Marcius' bearing to his fellow patricians. All they
can see of him is that he is a valiant soldier, and that he hates them fanatically.
Now the citizens are starving, and in arms; it is little wonder that they are deter-
mined to kill Marcius: &lsquo;For the gods know, I speak this in hunger for bread, not in
thirst for revenge&rsquo;; &lsquo;He's a very dog to the commonalty.&rsquo; The citizens have no
cause to suspect, as we who know him better have, that he is a dog whose bark is
worse than his bite.</p>
<p>The tumult is appeased, Marcius again wins honour in the war, and the citizens
are magnanimous enough to support their old enemy against all competitors for
the consulship. This comes, of course, from Plutarch; but Plutarch makes it
clear that up to this point there had not been on either side the exasperation which
Shakespeare depicts. Such scenes as the plebeians seeking to kill Marcius, or
Marcius threatening massacre to thousands of the plebeians, are out of the ques-
tion, at this stage, in Shakespeare's source. All the greater, you may say, Shake-
speare's estimate of the changeableness of the citizens; but assuredly all the
greater his estimate of their generosity and forgiveness. The citizens recall a bit-
ter old gibe of Marcius', but only as subject for good-natured chaff, half admit-
ting it to be true. And the Third Citizen sums up, &lsquo;I say, if he would incline to
<pb n="713"/>

the people, there was never a worthier man.&rsquo; And though their speech is grotesque
the citizens also are worthy men.</p>
<p>And all this frank generosity Marcius rewards by open scorn, and by a haughty
refusal to show his wounds according to custom. The citizens are surprised; never-
theless they do not at first go back upon their decision to support him against his
rivals:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Third Cit.</hi> But this is something odd.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Sec. Cit.</hi> And 'twere to give again&mdash;but 'tis no matter.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
When the different groups of two or three, who have been talking to Marcius,
meet together again in a body, they find that they have all been mocked alike,
though even here the voice of charity is heard:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">First Cit.</hi> No, 'tis his kind of speech; he did not mock us.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
If we compare carefully the citizens' report of Marcius' demeanour with his
actual words, there is no misrepresentation, except on the part of the charitable
citizen. Then the tribunes intervene and denounce the &lsquo;childish friendliness&rsquo;
that would yield voices &lsquo;to him that did not ask but mock,&rsquo; whilst refusing votes
to those who ask in proper form.</p>
<p>Of course, it is because he so badly needs their voices that Marcius has been
insolent to the citizens. He is too proud to flatter. It is a proof of the meanness
of spirit of the tribunes that, whilst they know Marcius well enough to play on
his weaknesses, they never understand his nobility. Still, their argument looks
logical enough, and we cannot wonder that, so admonished, the citizens decide to
refuse Marcius:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;He's not confirm'd: we may deny him yet.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
Which of us, in their place, would have done otherwise?</p>
<p>Now, not only is this not Plutarch's story; it is the direct reverse of Plutarch's
story. In Plutarch the change is due solely to the political fears of the plebeians,
and there is no hint, at this point, of scornful bearing on the part of Marcius: if
his friends err, it is by making too great entreaty on his behalf. Nor is there any
question here in Plutarch of interference on the part of the tribunes. Shakespeare
has altered the facts, as he received them, to exonerate the people at the expense
of their leaders, and, above all, of Marcius.</p>
<p>Then, when he learns that the citizens will no longer support him, Shakespeare's
Marcius exclaims, &lsquo;Have I had children's voices&rsquo; (as though he himself were not
the cause of the change), and proposes to deprive the people of their liberties
&lsquo;and throw their power i' the dust.&rsquo; The tribunes answer by accusing him of
treason, and demanding his punishment. Here again Shakespeare has altered
his authority. In Plutarch the people reject Marcius and elect his rivals consuls;
and there for the moment matters rest; it is later, as a private senator, and with
no claim of his own to the consulship, that Marcius proposes to take the office
of tribune from the people. Shakespeare's main object in making this change is,
no doubt, to hasten the action; but it also has the effect of justifying the citizens.
When Marcius, regarded by the nobility as consul elect, and so regarding himself,
meets the opposition of the plebeians by proposing the destruction of all their
liberties, what can the citizens do except back their leaders in demanding his
banishment? For &lsquo;he hath power to crush.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yet, even at this stage, Menenius (who should know, and who does not flatter
the people except sometimes to their face) believes that, if Marcius will but utter
a few gentle words, it will not only save him from banishment (&lsquo;save what is
<pb n="714"/>

dangerous present&rsquo;), but even now gain him the consulship (&lsquo;save the loss of what
is past&rsquo;). If he will but recant publicly what he has spoken,
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;why, their hearts were yours,<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free<lb/>
As words to little purpose.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
But it cannot be; for between the headstrong temper of Marcius and the venom-
ous malice of the tribunes, who deliberately play upon that temper, the citizens
are as helpless as Othello in the toils of Iago.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> It has been maintained that
Shakspere was not a democrat himself, but an aristocrat rather, not to say a snob,
in his attitude toward the plain people; and the evidence in support of this has been
derived partly from <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> partly from <hi rend="italic">Julius C&aelig;sar,</hi> and partly from the
Jack Cade episodes in <hi rend="italic">Henry VI.</hi> It has been urged that these passages, taken
collectively, show that Shakspere had no liking for the populace. This assertion
has a certain specious plausibility. If phrases are taken from the mouths of Shak-
spere's characters and transferred to Shakspere himself, then there is no difficulty in
making up a mass of derogatory expressions, full of bitter contempt for the people.</p>
<p>But, of course, this is just what we have no right to do. Shakspere may not be a
democrat, but he is a dramatist, and he lets all his creatures express themselves in
their own words and utter amply what they may have in their own hearts. If these
characters are disdainful aristocrats, then he allows them to express their con-
tempt for the vulgar herd; and there is no justification for the assumption that they
are serving at that moment as the mouthpieces of Shakspere himself. The dramatic
poet differs from the lyric poet mainly in his possession of the power of projecting
himself into other personalities and of keeping his own opinion to himself as
far as this is possible. What Shakspere says in his sonnets and in his narrative
poems we may accept, if we choose, as what he thought and felt as Shakspere.
But what Jack Cade or coriolanus may say in the plays wherein they appear is what
Jack Cade and Coriolanus must say if they are to obey the law of their own being.</p>
<p>Other adverse critics there are who admit the injustice of crediting Shakspere
with the sayings of his characters, and yet who urge that he clearly discloses his
dislike for the plain people in the handling of the several mob-scenes in which the
populace is presented as foolish, fickle, and easily captivated by empty claptrap.
And there is no denying that thus presented the charge has a far firmer support, and
that it is not to be met by the mere assertion of any dramatic necessity for so repre-
senting the populace. When we study the mob-scenes we can hardly escape the
conviction that Shakspere detested and despised the mob. But who of us does not
&mdash;even today in these democratic times? It is the mob that Shakspere seems to
despise, and not the whole people, of which the mob is only a single constituent
element and the least worthy. The mob is the residuum of the populace, the
baser part in its basest aspects. It is as dangerous today and as much to be
dreaded as it was when Coriolanus and Julius C&aelig;sar were alive; and Shakspere's
abhorrence of it is now shared by all who recall the Lord George Gordon dis-
turbances in London, the draft riots in New York, and the inexcusable excesses of
the closing hours of the Commune in Paris.</p>
<p>So far as we can judge from his plays Shakspere has the universal toleration
which comes from universal understanding. He has no liking for silly mobs, as
he has no liking for bloody tyrants or for foppish courtiers. Richard III. and
<pb n="715"/>

Macbeth are monarchs whose dark natures he makes us see for ourselves, as he
also exposes Le Beau and Osric in all their empty pretentiousness. He is not a
snob, nor is he a sycophant. He was almost the only poet who did not come
forward with a dirge or an elegy after the death of Elizabeth. Yet it is probably
true that he was not a democrat, and that he believed in a firm rule for the state,
which in his day meant a monarchy. And here he was in accord with the most
enlightened opinion of his own time and of his own country. So far as we can judge
he was no political theorist anticipating the experiments of the future.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>Shakespeare has been censured for having&mdash;out of predilection
for the aristocracy, perhaps even for some flattering consideration to his public, to
his great and noble patrons and friends&mdash;placed the people so much in the shade
compared with Coriolanus and the Roman patricians, that they almost invariably
present but a ludicrous appearance. . . . I think, however, that Shakespeare
is in no need of any justification for not having placed the plebs, as a political
party, on a level with the patricians, and for having presented them to us in their
natural human aspect, with their natural human weaknesses and virtues&mdash;which
are ever predominant in the people as such; neither does the poet require to be
justified for having laid more stress upon the former than upon the latter, and, in
accordance with this, for having stamped their leaders&mdash;the tribunes&mdash;demagogues,
and as endeavouring by intrigues to make the plebs a political party, to raise
them to political greatness. For it is just this contrast between the political and
the natural in man that forms the central point upon which the whole drama turns;
Shakespeare required such a people because his object was to give a full and vivid
representation of the nature and character of the aristocracy within this general
contrast. Lastly, the same cause that proves the ruin of Coriolanus leads to the
mother losing her son, the wife her husband, and the son his father. The same
political virtue, which is the pride of the whole race of the Marcii, and even pene-
trates and inspires their women, forces the mother and wife (because in them it is
not clouded by passion, and asserts itself in a purer and more disinterested manner)
to become untrue to themselves and to entreat for that which is opposed to the
life of the son and husband.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p>In the taverns, the brothels, and
the jails Shakespeare found the foulmouthed, the ignorant, and the dishonest,
and he represented them in all these particulars in a faithful, if at times, forbidding,
reality to life. Moreover, his prejudice against evil is pronounced in the very
repulsiveness of such scenes. He knows that there are impostors among beggars,
that trial by combat is only a somewhat cruder method of getting at the truth than
trial by jury, that there are corrupt and incompetent magistrates and fools abound-
ing in all walks of life. Moreover, he depicts in his plays a feudal state of society,
for such was English society in his day. But there is nothing in these honest dra-
matic pictures of English life, from the king on his throne to Abhorson with his
headsman's axe, to declare Shakespeare prejudiced against any class of his fellow-
countrymen. Wherefore, our obvious generalization as to Shakespeare's attitude
toward common folk, whether they be learned or unlearned, is this: he found among
them the stupid, the ignorant, the pretentious, and the absurd; but he found likewise
in each class the earnest, the honorable, and capable, and honored each after his kind
as such. For their follies he ridiculed them; for their virtues, which he recognized,
he loved them, deflecting neither to ridicule nor respect because of station in life.</p></quote></cit>

<div2 type="subsction" n="Nahum Tates Ingratitude of a Commonwealth"><head>NAHUM TATE'S <hi rend="italic">INGRATITUDE OF A COMMONWEALTH</hi></head>

<p>In 1682 Nahum Tate made an alteration of Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> under the
title <hi rend="italic">The Ingratitude of a Commonwealth; or, The Fall of Caius Marcius Coriolanus.</hi>
It quite deservedly proved unsuccessful. The following analysis is given by
<cit>
<bibl><ref target="genest-1832" targOrder="U"><hi rend="smallcap">Genest</hi> (vol. i, p. 326)</ref></bibl>
<quote><p> In the dedication Tate says, &lsquo;Upon a close view of this
story there appeared in some passages no small resemblance with the busy faction
of our own time; and, I confess, I chose rather to set the parallel nearer to sight
than to throw it off at farther distance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are no performers' names to the Dramatis Person&aelig;.</p>
<p>Act 1st begins as in Shakspeare, and proceeds with slight variations, till a
Messenger enters, and tells Caius Martius that he is appointed substitute to
Cominius in the room of Lartius&mdash;after the scene between the Ladies&mdash;Caius
Martius enters before the walls of Corioles, for so Tate calls Corioli.</p>
<p>Act 2d. Tate omits the whole till Coriolanus enters&mdash;he addresses his Mother
with &lsquo;Oh Madam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Act 3d. Tate very properly closes this act with the parting between Coriolanus
and his friends&mdash;Young Martius is introduced, and a page and half added&mdash;there
is likewise a new scene between Volumnia and Valeria&mdash;that between Volumnia
and the Tribunes (in the next act) is omitted.</p>
<p>Act 4th begins with Coriolanus, not at Antium, but at Corioles&mdash;he makes a
short speech, and the scene changes to the house of Aufidius&mdash;when the servants
go out Aufidius re-enters with Nigridius, a villain discharged by Coriolanus, and
received by Aufidius&mdash;Nigridius speaks in part what belongs to the Lieutenant&mdash;
the discontent of Aufidius is made very injudiciously to break out too soon&mdash;
when the Tribunes enter at Rome, the two scenes are consolidated and shortened&mdash;
Coriolanus is discovered sitting in state&mdash;Menenius addresses some few lines to
him, by Tate&mdash;Volumnia, Virgilia, &amp;c., enter&mdash;Valeria does not enter, yet what is
said of her in the original is retained.</p>
<p>Act 5th is chiefly Tate's&mdash;Volumnia, Valeria, &amp;c., enter at Rome&mdash;Volumnia,
hearing that Nigridius has formed a plot against the life of Coriolanus, determines
to set off for Corioles with Virgilia and young Martius&mdash;Aufidius and Nigridius
enter&mdash;then follows the scene with Coriolanus and the Volscians, partly from
Shakspeare&mdash;Coriolanus fights with Aufidius and his party&mdash;they are both mortally
wounded&mdash;Aufidius threatens to ravish Virgilia before her husband's face&mdash;she is
brought in wounded&mdash;Aufidius dies&mdash;and then Virgilia&mdash;Nigridius boasts that he
has racked young Martius&mdash;Coriolanus asks&mdash;
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Well, Cerberus, how then didst thou dispose him?<lb/>
Didst eat him?&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
Nigridius replies that he threw him still alive, but with all his limbs broken, into
the arms of Volumnia&mdash;she enters mad with young Martius&mdash;she kills Nigridius
and runs off&mdash;the boy dies&mdash;Coriolanus concludes the play with a dying speech.</p>
<p>Tate's alteration is, on the whole, a very bad one; he omits a good deal of the
original to make room for the new 5th act&mdash;his own additions are insipid, and he
makes numberless unnecessary changes in the dialogue, but the first 4 acts of his
play do not differ very materially from Shakspeare&mdash;he has been guilty of a mani-
fest absurdity in turning Valeria into a talkative fantastical lady&mdash;the new scenes
which he gives her are not bad in themselves, but they are unsuitable not only
<pb n="717"/>

to the real character, but to the time in which she lived&mdash;the part of Valeria, as
written by Tate, bears some resemblance to that of Sempronia in <hi rend="italic">Cataline</hi>&mdash;
Volumnia's speeches, when she is mad, are contemptible to the last degree.</p>
<p>In justice to Tate it should be observed that he has made one considerable
improvement&mdash;Shakspeare has been guilty of a mistake in repeatedly saying
that Caius Marcius was alone when he forced his way into Corioli&mdash;Tate uniformly
represents him as not being quite alone on this occasion&mdash;Plutarch says he had a
very few friends with him&mdash;Livy and Dionysius Halicarnassensis afford still less
ground for the supposition that he was alone&mdash;Coriolanus was a man of extraor-
dinary courage, but it is absurd to make him an absolute Almanzor&mdash;The Prologue
says of Tate:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Yet he presumes he may be safe to-day,<lb/>
Since Shakspeare gave foundation to the play.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>It then tells us what Tate has done&mdash;
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;He only ventures to make gold from ore,<lb/>
And turn to money, what lay dead before.&rsquo;<lb/>

<div2 n="Denniss Invader of his Country" type="subsection"><head>DENNIS'S <hi rend="italic">INVADER OF HIS COUNTRY</hi></head>
<p></p>
<p><ref target="genest-1832" targOrder="U"><hi rend="smallcap">Genest</hi></ref> thus records the first performance of Dennis's alteration of Shakespeare's
Tragedy, and adds thereto an analysis of the work:
<quote><p>November 11, 1719. Never acted, the Invader of his Country, or the Fatal
Resentment (altered by Dennis from Shakspeare). Coriolanus = Booth; Aufidius =
Mills; Menenius = Cory; Cominius = Thurmond; Sicinius = W. Wilks; Brutus =
Walker; Titus Largius = Williams; Citizens and Servants = Penkethman, Johnson,
Miller, Norris, &amp;c. Volumnia = Mrs Porter; Virgilia = Mrs Thurmond. If any-
body but Dennis himself had spelt Titus Lartius with a <hi rend="italic">g</hi> instead of a <hi rend="italic">t</hi> Dennis
would have been the first to have called him a blockhead. Tho' great part of this
Tragedy is Shakspeare's, and there can be no doubt that Booth played Coriolanus
well, yet it was acted only 3 times&mdash;after which the Managers, to the great indig-
nation of Dennis, gave out another play, assigning as a reason, that it was not
worth their while to act any piece that would not bring them &pound;100.</p>
<p>Dennis, in a dedication of 10 pages to the Duke of Newcastle, at that time
Lord Chamberlain, complains bitterly of two or three insolent actors (particularly
Cibber) who had no capacity, no education, nor the least concern for their country
&mdash;for Dennis, it must be observed, wrote this play in the cause of his country and
his sovereign&mdash;it was to have come out on Nov. 10th, but the Managers put it
off till the 11th, that it might not interfere with the benefit of a young author at
Lincoln's Inn Fields&mdash;this threw Dennis' own benefit on a Friday; and Friday, he
says, was not only the worst day in the week for an audience, but his was that
particular Friday when a hundred persons, who designed to be there, were either
gone to meet the King, or preparing in town to do their duty to him on his arrival
from abroad&mdash;Dennis then modestly asserts that the Managers and their stage
were more indebted to him than to any other writer in England&mdash;after all he does
not prove that he was particularly ill used, but he proves that when a man is
blinded with passion he will say any thing&mdash;no one had talked more about liberty
than Dennis; yet he here wants the Duke to interfere with the management of
the theatre in the same arbitrary manner in which his predecessors in office had
<pb n="718"/>

done&mdash;and calls him the lawful monarch of the Stage&mdash;in an advertisement he
again attacks Cibber and his Tragedies, and says no one can get a play acted at
Drury Lane, unless he will flatter Wilks by telling him that he is an excellent
Tragedian&mdash;which would be ridiculous and absurd.</p>
<p>Act 1st. Dennis omits the scene between Coriolanus and the Citizens, and that
between the Ladies&mdash;he begins with Cominius at the head of the Roman army and
the whole act consists of the military scenes.</p>
<p>Act 2d. He begins with a scene between Volumnia and Virgilia&mdash;omits the
scene between Menenius and the Tribunes&mdash;that between Menenius and Volumnia,
and the scene in the Capitol&mdash;he alters the meeting between Coriolanus and his
wife and mother for the worse&mdash;he adds a good deal of low Comedy to the parts
of the Citizens.</p>
<p>Act 3d. He mutilates the first scene between Coriolanus and the Tribunes
shamefully, and concludes the act with a parting scene between Coriolanus and
Virgilia:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;<hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Adieu!<lb/>
In quest of great revenge thy Lover flies.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Virg.</hi> Support me, Virgins, for Virgilia dies.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
He had before said that the God of War had saved him at the request of Love's
propitious Goddess&mdash;Cibber himself could not have done worse than this.</p>
<p>Act 4th. He begins with Coriolanus at Antium and puts in more low Comedy&mdash;
Aufidius and the Volscians are discovered at table and Coriolanus is introduced&mdash;
the scene between the Servants is considerably altered from the original one&mdash;the
scene at Rome concludes with the Citizens driving off the Tribunes with an intent
to throw them from the Tarpeian Rock.</p>
<p>Act 5th. The scenes in which Menenius is concerned are omitted, and through-
out the play his speeches of humour are left out&mdash;Aufidius and his Officers begin
the act&mdash;Coriolanus enters, and then Volumnia and the other Ladies&mdash;Aufidius
goes out&mdash;Volumnia produces a dagger and threatens to make use of it, but she
does not absolutely attempt to stab herself&mdash;when the Women retire, Coriolanus
fights with Aufidius and kills him&mdash;he is killed by the Volscians&mdash;the women re-
enter before he dies&mdash;Cominius comes on and concludes the piece&mdash;Dennis has
retained about half of the original play, which he has altered much for the worse&mdash;
as he was a man of abilities and a professed Critic, it might reasonably have been
expected of him that he would have had too much good sense to have mangled
Shakspeare in the way that Tate, Cibber, and others had done.</p></quote>

<!--ref target value unknown-->
<quote><p> Mr Dennis proceeds very generously to apologize for
Shakspeare's faults by observing that he had neither friends to consult nor time to
make corrections. He also attributes his lines &lsquo;utterly void of celestial fire,&rsquo;
and passages &lsquo;harsh and unmusical,&rsquo; to the want of leisure to wait for felicitous
hours and moments of choicest inspiration. To remedy these defects&mdash;to mend
the harmony and to put life into the dulness of Shakspeare&mdash;Mr Dennis has
assayed, and brought his own genius to the alteration of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> for the stage
under the lofty title of the <hi rend="italic">Invader of his Country, or the Fatal Resentment.</hi> In
the catastrophe Coriolanus kills Aufidius, and is himself afterwards slain, to satisfy
the requisitions of poetical justice, which, to Mr Dennis's great distress, Shakspeare
so often violates. It is quite amusing to observe with how perverted an ingenuity
all the gaps in Shakspeare's verses are filled up, the irregularities smoothed away,
<pb n="719"/>

and the colloquial expressions changed for stately phrases. Thus, for example, the
noble wish of Coriolanus on entering the forum&mdash;
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;The honoured gods<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice<lb/>
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among us!<lb/>
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,<lb/>
And not our streets with war&rsquo;&mdash;<lb/>
</hi>
is thus elegantly translated into classical language:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;The great and tutelary gods of Rome<lb/>
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice<lb/>
Supplied with worthy men: plant love among you:<lb/>
Adorn our temples with the pomp of peace,<lb/>
And, from our streets drive horrid war away.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>The conclusion of the hero's last speech on leaving Rome&mdash;
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Thus I turn my back: there is a world elsewhere&rsquo;&mdash;<lb/>
</hi>
is elevated into the following heroic lines:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;For me, thus, thus, I turn my back upon you,<lb/>
And make a better world where'er I go.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>His fond expression of constancy to his wife&mdash;
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;That kiss<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip<lb/>
Hath virgined it e'er since&rsquo;&mdash;<lb/>
</hi>
is thus refined:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;That kiss<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
I carried from my love, and my true lip<lb/>
Hath ever since preserved it like a virgin.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>The icicle which was wont to &lsquo;hang on Dian's temple,&rsquo; here more gracefully
&lsquo;hangs upon the temple of Diana.&rsquo; The burst of mingled pride and triumph of
Coriolanus when taunted with the word &lsquo;boy,&rsquo; is here exalted to tragic dignity.
Our readers have, doubtless, ignorantly admired the original.
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Boy! False hound!<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,<lb/>
That like an eagle in a dove cote, I<lb/>
Fluttered your Volsces in Corioli.<lb/>
Alone I did it&mdash;Boy.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>The following is the improved version:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;This boy, that like an eagle in a dove court,<lb/>
Flutter'd a thousand Volsces in Corioli,<lb/>
And did it without second or acquittance,<lb/>
Thus sends their mighty chief to mourn in hell!&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>Who does not now appreciate the sad lot of Shakespeare&mdash;so feelingly bewailed
by Mr Dennis&mdash;that he had not a critic, of the age of King William, by his side,
to refine his style and elevate his conceptions!</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p>Again we see what havoc the application of an artificial
notion can work with a play of Shakespeare's. Dennis has but stultified himself
by attempting to improve Shakespeare, the absence of the superior enlightenment
and knowledge of dramatic art he believed himself to possess being amply demon-
strated by his performance in this instance, as it had been also in the case of his
revision of <hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor.</hi></p>
<p>The poet James Thomson in 1747 finished a tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> which is
entirely independent of Shakespeare's play, a different source having been followed.
His play, which was not acted and printed until 1749, the year after his death,
is written in a cold classical manner and, indeed, is one of those tragedies in
which, to use Doctor Johnson's phrase, &lsquo;Declamation roared, whilst Passion
slept.&rsquo;</p>
<p>[Genest records but a single performance of Thomson's <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi> The pro-
ceeds of this were intended for the relief of the Poet's sisters. Quin emerged
from comparative retirement at Bath to enact the title r&ocirc;le, and, it may here be
incidentally said, the remarkable representation of Quin in the character of Corio-
lanus, which has been several times reproduced, gives us the actor as he appeared
in Thomson's tragedy. There is no authentic record of Quin's appearance in
Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> at any time in his career.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p> Shakspeare, in the names of his characters and in
almost every other particular, copies Plutarch; Thomson follows Dionysius
Halicarnassensis and Livy, both of whom call the Mother of Coriolanus, Veturia,
and the Wife, Volumnia.</p>
<p>To write a play on the same subject with one of Shakspeare's is the most
arduous task a dramatic writer can attempt; it is easy to avoid Shakspeare's
faults, but difficult indeed to equal his beauties&mdash;Thomson's is certainly not a bad
play, but when compared with Shakspeare's, it is regular, cold, and declamatory&mdash;
Shakspeare has hit off the character of Coriolanus admirably; Thomson has con-
siderably softened it&mdash;he grossly misrepresents it when he says of him that he
was adorned with every virtue of civil life&mdash;Plutarch expressly tells us that they
who admired him for his temperance, justice, and courage, disliked him in his
civil transactions as overbearing, unpleasant, and aristocratical&mdash;Dionysius
Halicarnassensis says much the same thing&mdash;the scene lies during the whole of
Thomson's play in the Volscian camp; of course his plan differs materially from
Shakspeare's, except in the 5th act&mdash;Galesus is a sort of Pythagorean Philosopher,
a character introduced improperly, both as to time and place&mdash;as to time, for tho'
Pythagoras had been in Italy, yet there is no reason to suppose that his doctrines
had made any progress among the Volsci&mdash;as to place, for what is more absurd
than to preach against war in a Camp?&mdash;to Galesus, however, Thomson has given
many excellent sentiments and expressed them in appropriate language&mdash;he has
borrowed largely from Dionysius Halicarnassensis&mdash;which is very fair&mdash;this was
a posthumous play&mdash;Quin in the Prologue speaking of his deceased friend says:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Forgive the gushing tear,<lb/>
Alas! I feel I am no actor here.&rsquo;<lb/>

face with wrinkles to suit the character&mdash;what modern actress would do this?</p></quote></cit>

Roman Matron:</hi> <quote><p>Act 1st. The first act of Shakspeare is entirely omitted except
the scene between Veturia and Volumnia (for Sheridan has preferred Thomson's
names to Shakspeare's), with which this play begins&mdash;then follows the 2d act of
Shakspeare not materially altered, except that in the Senate scene Coriolanus does
not appear till he is called.</p>
<p>Act 2d consists of Shakspeare's 3d act&mdash;the first part of it, when the Tribunes
enter, is curtailed in a manner that reflects the utmost disgrace on Sheridan's
judgment&mdash;
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Have you informed them since?<lb/>
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?<lb/>
Mark you his absolute shall&rsquo;&mdash;<lb/>
</hi>
and some other of Coriolanus' most effective speeches are omitted. (Dennis had
before done the same.)</p>
<p>Act 3d is not contaminated with one line from Shakspeare&mdash;it consists of Thom-
son's 1st act, with some addition from the 2d.</p>
<p>Act 4th begins with the scene between Tullus and Volusius from Thomson's
3d act; then follows a scene at Rome between Menenius and the Tribunes; this
scene is made up from 3 scenes of Shakspeare, with some addition about throwing
the Tribunes from the Tarpeian Rock&mdash;then follows another scene between Tullus
and Volusius from Thomson.</p>
<p>Act 5th is entirely Thomson's, except that when Tullus and Coriolanus quarrel,
about 17 lines are introduced from Shakspeare; and after Coriolanus is dead
Tullus speaks 2 lines from Shakspeare and 7 that Sheridan gives him&mdash;Galesus
concludes the play as in Thomson&mdash;the Epilogue to Thomson's play is added
with the conclusion altered&mdash;On the whole this alteration is a very bad one&mdash;
many fine parts of Shakspeare's play are omitted to make room for some cold
scenes from Thomson&mdash;Sheridan has added a second title&mdash;the Roman Matron&mdash;
was not the original one sufficient? or was it proper that a play to be produced
at Covent Garden should imitate those country playbills in which a stupid second
title is frequently added to attract the vulgar?
<pb n="722"/>
</p>
<p>In the preface the person who made the alteration says the success this play
has met with in both kingdoms (for it was first performed on the Dublin stage)
has more than answered his expectations&mdash;he adds that the military ovation had
been much admired&mdash;Sheridan conveyed in his acting a masterly knowledge of the
character of Coriolanus and the play drew some good houses. (Wilkinson.)</p></quote>

<quote><p> J. P. Kemble, whose great part was Coriolanus, made an
alteration, which was acted at Drury Lane in 1789. What might have been a legiti-
mate and judicious abridgment and adaptation of Shakespeare's play is spoiled
by borrowing from Thomson in the Fourth and Fifth Acts. In the Fourth Act
especially there is certainly no necessity for a resort to such a practice, as Shake-
speare has provided an abundance of material. As it is, five whole scenes are
rejected in favor of inferior matter from Thomson. In the Fifth Act the action
and dialogue are more Thomson's than Shakespeare's. The latter's conclusion
being a little lame, Kemble saw fit to attempt to improve it by introducing the
quarrel scene between Coriolanus and Aufidius from Thomson. Granting that he
has accomplished his object, one cannot but wish that he had not known Thomson's
play, or, instead of resorting to it, had confined himself to Shakespeare. The
same judiciousness he had exhibited in revising the first three acts would probably,
if applied in treating the last two, have produced a definitive acting version of
Shakespeare's play.</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p> <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> even as treated by Shakespeare, is unsym-
pathetic to many, and the legend is of so little historic significance that it is often
omitted from modern handbooks of Roman history; so, for these reasons, despite
its pre-eminent fitness for the stage, it was generally passed over.</p>
<p>Not universally, however. It seems already to have engaged the attention of
one important dramatist in France, the prolific and gifted Alexandre Hardy.
Hardy began to publish his works only in 1623, and the volume containing his
<hi rend="italic">Coriolan</hi> appeared only in 1625; so there is hardly any possibility of Shakespeare's
having utilised this play. And, on the other hand, it was certainly written before
1608, probably in the last years of the sixteenth century, but in any case by 1607,
so there is even less possibility of its being influenced by Shakespeare's treatment.
All the more interesting is it to observe the coincidences that exist between them,
and that are due to their having selected a great many of the same motifs from
Plutarch's story. It shows that in that story Plutarch met the playwright half
way, and justified the statement of Hardy in his argument that &lsquo;few subjects are
to be found in Roman history which are worthier of the stage.&rsquo; The number of
subsequent French dramas with Coriolanus as hero proves that he was right, though
in England, as so frequently, Shakespeare's name put a veto on new experiments.</p>
<p>Hardy's tragedy in style and structure follows the Senecan manner of Jodelle
and Garnier, but he compromised with medi&aelig;val fashions in so far as to adopt
the peculiar modification of the &lsquo;simultaneous&rsquo; or &lsquo;complex&rsquo; decoration which is
usual in his other plays. In accordance with that, several scenes were presented
at the same time on the stage, and actors made their first speeches from the area
<pb n="723"/>

appropriated to that one of them which the particular phase of the action required.
There was thus considerable latitude in regard to the unity of place, and even more
in regard to the unity of time; but the freedom was not so great as in the Eliza-
bethan theatre, for after all there was space only for a limited number of scenes,
or &lsquo;mansions&rsquo; as they would formerly have been called. Generally there were five,
two at each side and one at the back. In the <hi rend="italic">Coriolan</hi> there were six, and there is
as well a seventh place indicated in the play without scenical decoration. Even
so they are few compared with the two and twenty that Shakespeare employs;
and though no doubt that number might be considerably reduced without injury
to the effect, by running together localities that approximate in character and
position, one street with another street, the forum with a public place and the
like, still it would in any case exceed what Hardy allows himself. This may
account for some of his omissions as compared with Shakespeare.</p>
<p>His scenarium includes the house of Coriolanus and the forum at Rome, the
house of Coriolanus and the house of Amfidius at Antium, the Volscian camp near
Rome, the council-hall at Antium, and in addition to these an indeterminate spot
where Coriolanus soliloquises after his expulsion. There is no room for Corioli,
and this may be why Hardy begins somewhat later than Shakespeare with the
collision between the hero and the people, and gets as far as the banishment by
the end of the first act. In the second, Marcius leaves Rome, presents himself
to Amfidius, and obtains the leadership of the Volscians. The third portrays the
panic of the Romans and the reception of their embassage by Coriolanus. In the
fourth, the Roman ladies make ready to accompany Volumnia on her mission,
Amfidius schemes to use all Coriolanus' faults for his destruction, Volumnia arrives
in the camp and makes her petition, which her son at length grants, though he
foresees the result. The fifth is occupied with his murder in the Senate House at
Antium, and concludes with his mother's reception of the news.</p>
<p>Thus the sequence and selection of episodes are much the same in the two
tragedies, except that Hardy, perhaps, as I have said, owing to the exigencies of
his decorative system, does not begin till the exploit at Corioli is over, and adds,
as he could do so by using once more Coriolanus' house in Rome, the final scene
with Volumnia. Otherwise the scaffolding of the plays is very similar, and it is
because both follow closely the excellent guidance of Plutarch. But it is interesting
also to note that some of their additions are similar, for when they were inde-
pendently made, it shows how readily Plutarch's narrative suggested such supple-
ments. Thus, as in Shakespeare, but not as in Plutarch, Volumnia counsels her
son to bow his pride before the people, and he, though in the end consenting, at
first refuses.

<hi rend="blockquote"><quote><l><hi rend="italic">Coriolan.</hi> Madame, on me verroit mille morts endurer,<lb/></l>

<l>Non, je ne le veux faire, et ne crains sa rancune.&rsquo;<lb/></l>
</quote></hi>
Thus Coriolanus, again as in Shakespeare, but not as in Plutarch, accepts his
banishment as a calamity to those that inflict it.
<hi rend="blockquote"><quote><l>&lsquo;Je luy obeirai, ouy ouy, je mettrai soin</l>
<l>De quitter ces ingrats plust&ocirc;t qu'ils n'ont besoin.&rsquo;</l>
</quote></hi>
Thus the machinations of Amfidius before the final cause of offense are amplified
far beyond the limits of Plutarch, and these are in part excused by his previous
rivalry with Coriolanus, which, as in Shakespeare, is made ever so much more
personal and graphic.
<hi rend="blockquote"><quote><l>&lsquo;Un esperon d'honneur cent fois nous a conduits,</l>

In short, though Hardy's drama, as compared with Shakespeare's, is a work of
talent as compared with a work of genius, it shows that the Life had in it the mate-
rial for a tragedy already rough-dressed, with indications, obvious to a practised
playwright, of some of the processes that still were needed.</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p> Hardy was a voluminous and popular
playwright who had, like Shakespeare, begun his career as an actor. Although
he interpreted Senecan principles of dramatic art with freedom, he respected the
classical temper and most of the classical canons. In the case of <hi rend="italic">Coriolan</hi> he
observed the unity of action by opening the scene with the banishment of the hero
and by strictly confining the succeeding episode to the events issuing in his death.
The monologues of Coriolanus and Volumnia fill most of Hardy's pages, and the
chorus of Roman citizens hardly relieves the monotonous effect. Hardy never
rises to the level of tragic passion, but his fluent pen always had at command an
ample store of stilted dignity. The simplicity of the tragic motive with its filial
sentiment well harmonised with French ideals of classical drama and with the
French domestic temperament. For more than two centuries the seed which Hardy
had sown fructified, and no less than three and twenty tragedies on the subject
blossomed since Hardy's day in the French theatres. The later French dramatists
liberally revised the simple plot and greatly developed the female interest. Corio-
lanus' wife in some of the French tragedies acquires a prominence almost equal
to that of her husband or her mother-in-law, and at times her influence is shared
or disputed by the hero's mistress or daughter or sister. But despite the occasional
complications of later French ingenuity it is the singleness of interest attaching to
Coriolanus' relation with his mother which chiefly sustained the tragic fable in
the stream of French drama.
<pb n="725"/></p>
<p>It may be no more than a fortuitous coincidence that Shakespeare took up the
dramatic parable just after its first enunciation in Paris; yet it is difficult to deny
the possibility that some mysterious affinity or influence drew his attention, almost
contemporaneously with the French playwright Hardy, to a dramatic theme whose
main characteristic was a severe classical simplicity. At first sight the topic
seemed to offer few opportunities or attractions to a dramatist whose immediately
preceding and succeeding achievement evinced a predominant sympathy with
stories instinct with emotional subtlety and romantic temper. Whether or no
Shakespeare knew aught of Hardy's experiment, his triumphant treatment in
the plenitude of his strength of a statuesque classical episode (without sub-
stantial variation of its tenour) is a striking testimony to the versatility of his
genius.</p></quote></cit>

were composed by: Cavalli, Parma, 1660; Perti, Venice, 1683; Polarolo, Venice,

1810(?). It seems that none of these libretti are based upon Shakespeare's work;
more likely might they have proceeded from the <hi rend="italic">Graunischen Werke,</hi> the text
whereof was due to Frederick the Great. In 1802 Heinrich von Collin wrote a
tragedy under the influence of Shakespeare, which two years later was put in print
in Berlin. But Collin falsified and mangled his source of inspiration, since he did
not know Shakespeare's drama.
<note anchored="yes" place="foot">For a full account of Collin's <hi rend="italic">Coriolan,</hi> see <hi rend="italic">Jahrbuch,</hi> xli, pp. 22-44.</note>
For the first performance of this work, which
took place at the Vienna Burgtheater, Abbe Stadler had arranged entre-act music
from themes out of Mozart's <hi rend="italic">Idomeneo.</hi> In 1807 Beethoven, who had heard this
music, determined to write an Overture to Collin's Tragedy. In March of that
year this had its first performance, and in January, 1808, appeared in print as
Opus 62. Richard Wagner has made use of the all-inspiring theme, Beethoven
and Shakespeare, as the motive of his Essay on Beethoven (<hi rend="italic">Gesammelte Werke,</hi>
ix, pp. 129 et seq.). Be it further recorded that an Overture and accompanying
music for Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> was produced by Frederick Ludwig Seidel in
1811 at the Berliner Koniglichen National Theater, and that 60 to 70 years later
Friederich Lux set to music a scene from the drama.</p></quote></cit>

<quote><p> After both Shakespeare and Hardy had passed away the Spanish dramatist, Calderon, produced
a dramatic fantasia on the theme of Coriolanus which is classed among his Armas
de la Hermosura (&lsquo;Signs of Beauty&rsquo;). It is a confused adaptation of Livy's
legendary annals of early Rome. Coriolanus is one of Romulus' generals, and his
wife, Veturia, is a ravished Sabine. Calderon's play seems to stand alone in
Spanish literature.</p></quote><note anchored="yes" place="inline"> [There is some confusion here. <hi rend="italic">Las Armas de la Hermosura</hi>
is the title of Calderon's drama; and it may be translated the Arms of Beauty,
not &lsquo;Signs.&rsquo; Ticknor (<hi rend="italic">History of Spanish Literature</hi>) refers to the play in one or
two foot-notes, but does not give any date of composition. Calderon began writing
for the stage in 1635 and, on his entrance to a religious order in 1650, ceased
writing secular dramas; between these dates, probably about 1640, this dramatic
fantasia was composed.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]</note></cit>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">Collier</hi>, in his <hi rend="italic">History of English Dramatic Poetry and the Stage</hi> (i, 430, foot-
note), quotes a long manuscript Elegy on Richard Barbage written soon after his
death in March, 1619-20, mentioning four of the characters acted by him, viz.:
<hi rend="italic">Hamlet, Hieronimo, Lear,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Othello.</hi> In his <hi rend="italic">New Particulars Regarding Shake-
speare,</hi> published five years later, Collier says (p. 27): &lsquo;Some time after the pub-
lication of my book the late Mr. Heber showed me a MS. of the same Elegy in
his possession, . . . but it did not furnish any additional information regarding
the many parts Barbage had sustained. I have since met with a third copy of
the same Elegy, in which the list of characters is enlarged from four to no fewer
than twenty, of which twelve are in plays by Shakespeare, viz.: <hi rend="italic">Hamlet, Romeo,</hi>
the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales, Henry V, Richard III, Macbeth, Brutus, Coriolanus, Shylock,
Lear, Pericles,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Othello.</hi> The other eight characters are in dramatic produc-
tions by various authors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lines directly referring to <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> are:
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Brutus and Marcius henceforth must be dumb<lb/>

raised his reputation in this char-

that Garrick, who was a quick gen-

<quote><p> John Philip Kemble made a stage
version of the tragedy, basing it on the Sheridan-Thomson admixture; produced it
at Drury Lane, February 7, 1789, and appeared for the first time as Coriolanus in
association with Mrs Siddons as Volumnia. Kemble's Coriolanus was considered
his grandest impersonation. He retained the part in his repertory to the end of
his career, acting it, with great power and effect, on the night of his final retire-
ment from the stage, June 23, 1817. . . .</p>
<p>Kemble's scenic setting of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> was characterized by classical scholar-
ship and tasteful opulence. The Rome exhibited was that of a much later
date than the Rome of the time of Coriolanus, when the Augustan splendor
of that city had not yet arrived. Among the objects shown was the Arch of
Constantine, Trajan's Column, and the Coliseum, things that Coriolanus never
saw.</p>
<p>Kemble's impersonation of Coriolanus evidently was an histrionic marvel.
Many judges of his time concurred in commending it, almost to extravagance, but
usually in general terms. No recorder (as far as I can ascertain) has described
it fully&mdash;with the particularity of specification which such a masterpiece deserved.
The nature of Kemble's excellence in this part is, however, to a slight extent
indicated by some of the written encomium: it is more largely left to be inferred
from what is said of his appearance, method, temperament, and quality, as sig-
nified in description of his acting in other parts, or of himself, in private life. The
most dominant of his characteristics was intrinsic dignity. His figure was tall
and impressive, his demeanor majestic, his utterance (though his voice, while
deep, was not strong) was clear, sonorous, and sympathetic.</p>
<p>[The same may likewise, unfortunately, be said of all the accounts of Mrs
Siddons's Volumnia. Both Boaden and Campbell merely speak of the general
excellence, and remarkable power of her interpretation.&mdash;<hi rend="smallcap">Ed.</hi>]</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> The success of Richard would in ordinary course necessitate
the trial of other leading characters. Coriolanus was the next selected by the
managers. In this I stood at disadvantage, with the recollection of Kemble still
fresh in the memory of the play-going public; but with a full consciousness of the
difficulty of my task, I went to work. To add dignity and grace to my deport-
ment I studied under D'Egville the various attitudes from the antique, and prac-
ticed the more stately walk which was enforced by the peculiarity of their dress on
the gens togata. I allowed myself no leisure, intent on mastering the patrician's
outward bearing, and under that giving full vent to the unbridled passion of the
man. My reception (Nov. 29th, 1819) was that of an acknowledged favorite, and
the applause throughout the play and at its close exceeded my most ambitious
hopes.</p>
<p>Among the flattering testimonies offered me on this second venture, none were
held by me in equal esteem with the graceful sonnet published in the <hi rend="italic">Literary
Gazette</hi> by Barry Cornwall:
<pb n="731"/>

<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;MR MACREADY IN <hi rend="italic">CORIOLANUS</hi><lb rend="RIGHT"/>
&lsquo;&ldquo;This is the noblest Roman of them all&rdquo;;<lb/>
And he shall wear his victor's crown, and stand<lb/>
Distinct amidst the genius of the land,<lb/>
And lift his head aloft while others fall.<lb/>
He hath not bowed him to the vulgar call,<lb/>
Nor bid his countenance shine obsequious, bland,<lb/>
But let his dark eye keep its high command,<lb/>
And gather'd &lsquo;from the few&rsquo; his coronal.<lb/>
Yet unassuming hath he won his way;<lb/>
And therefore fit to breathe the lines of him<lb/>
Who gayly, once, beside the Avon river,<lb/>
Shaped the great verse that lives, and shall live forever.<lb/>
But he now revels in eternal day,<lb/>
Peerless amongst the earth-born cherubim.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>From the <hi rend="italic">Morning Herald:</hi> &lsquo;Mr Macready by his performance of Coriolanus
last night has again won the first honors of the stage. The previous development
of this great performer's genius in Richard stripped his last night's enterprise of
all its peril and much of its aspiring. . . . We have merely room to state that in
the scenes where he consents, at the entreaty of his mother, to go back and con-
ciliate the incensed people, and where he gives vent to his scorn and defiance of
the tribunes, he gave proofs of variety, flexibility, and power rarely equalled and
absolutely unexcelled. . . . The quarrel with Aufidius, particularly that passage
in which Kemble was so fine&mdash;the retort of &ldquo;Boy&rdquo;&mdash;produced acclamation. . . .
There is one grand point in which no other living actor but Mr Macready can
approach Kemble&mdash;we mean the magic power of imposing an illusive image of
physical grandeur upon the very sense of the beholder merely by some slight
change of attitude or action. From the death of Coriolanus to the fall of the
curtain the house resounded with applause, and in the pit the waving of hats was
universal. Mr Egerton came on to announce the next performance, but was
obliged to give way for a general cry of Macready. He did accordingly make
his appearance, was received with the liveliest expressions of kindness by the
audience, and announced the repetition of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> on Wednesday.&rsquo;</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> The features and contour of the honest, imperious, fiery,
scornful, and heroic Coriolanus, as impersonated by Forrest with immense solidity
and distinctness, were simple but grand in their colossal and unwavering relief.
Kemble had been celebrated in this r&ocirc;le. He played it as if he were a symmetrical
statue cut out of cold steel and set in motion by some precise mechanical action.
Forrest added to this a blood that seemed to flame through him and a voice whose
ponderous syllables pulsated with fire. Stern virtue, ambition, deep tenderness,
magnanimity, transcendent daring, and pride and scorn&mdash;the man as soldier and
hero in uncorrupt sincerity and haughty defiance of everything wrong or mean&mdash;
these were the favorite attributes which Forrest met in Coriolanus, and absorbed
as by an electric affinity, and made the people recognize with applauding enthusi-
asm. He might well utter as his own the words of his part to Volumnia,
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Would you have me<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
False to my nature? Rather say, I play<lb/>
The man I am.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
<pb n="732"/>
</p>
<p>What unconsciously delighted Forrest in Coriolanus, and what he represented
with consummate felicity and force of nature, was that his aristocracy was of
the true democratic type; that is, it rested on a consciousness of intrinsic per-
sonal worth and superiority, not on conventional privilege and prescription. He
loathed and launched his scorching invectives against the commonalty not because
they were plebeians and he was a patrician, but because of the revolting opposition
of their baseness to his loftiness, of their sycophancy to his pride, of their treacher-
ous fickleness to his adamantine steadfastness. As an antique Roman he had the
resentful haughtiness of his social caste, but morally as an individual his disdain
and sarcasm were based on the contrast of intrinsically noble qualities in himself
to the contemptible qualities he saw predominating in those beneath him. And
although this is far removed from the beautiful bearing of a spiritually purified
and perfected manhood, yet there is in it a certain relative historical justification,
utility, and even glory, entirely congenial to the honest vernacular fervor of
Forrest. . . .</p>
<p>The signalizing memorable mark of the Coriolanus impersonated by Forrest
was the gigantic grandeur of his scale of being and consciousness. He revealed
this in his stand and port and moving and look and voice. The manner in which
he did it was no result of critical analysis, but was intuitive with him, given to
him by nature and inspiration. He exhibited a gravitating solidity of person, a
length of lines, a slowness of curves, an immensity of orbit, a reverberating sonority
of tone, which illustrated the man who, as Menenius said, &lsquo;wanted nothing of a
god but eternity, and a heaven to throne in.&rsquo; They went far to justify the amaz-
ing descriptions given in the play itself of the impressions produced by him on
those who approached him.</p>
<p>When, after his peerless feats in battle, the army and its leaders would idolize
him with praises, crown him with garlands, and load him with spoils, he felt his
deeds to be their own sufficient pay, and waved all the rewards peremptorily aside
with a mien as imposing as if some god
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Were slily crept into his human powers<lb/>
And gave him noble posture.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>Entering the capital in triumph, the vast and steady imperiality of his attitude,
the tremendous weight of his slightest inclination, as though the whole earth
were the pedestal-slab on which he stood, drew, and fascinated all gaze.
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Matrons flung gloves,<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchiefs,<lb/>
Upon him as he passed; the nobles bended<lb/>
As to Jove's statue; and the commons made<lb/>
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>The rare and exalted use of such acting as this is that it invites the audience to
lift their eyes above the vulgar pettinesses to which they are accustomed and extend
their souls with a superior conception of the dignity of human nature and of the
mysterious meanings latent in it.</p>
<p>The Coriolanus of Forrest was a marble apotheosis of heroic strength, pride,
and scorn. His moral glory was that he asserted himself on the solid grounds of
conscious truth, justice, and merit, and not, as popular demagogues and the
selfish members of the patrician class do, on hollow grounds of assumption, trick-
ery, and spoliating fraud. There was great beauty, too, in his reverential love for
<pb n="733"/>

his mother, his tender love for his wife, his hearty love for his friend, and his mag-
nanimous incapacity for any recognized littleness of soul or of deed. The weight
and might of his spirit could give away victories and confer favors, but could not
steal a laurel or endure flattery. His fatal defect was that he did not know the
spirit of forgiveness, and was utterly incompetent to self-renunciation. He had
the repulsive and fatal fault of a crude, harsh, revengeful temper, that clothed his
gigantic indirect egotism in the glorifying disguise of justice and sacrificed even
his country to his personal passion. Just and true at the roots, his virtues grew
insane from pride. Wrath destroyed his equilibrium, and belched his grandeur
and his life away in incontinent insolence of expression. Like all the favorite
characters of Forrest, however, he was no starveling fed on verbality and cere-
mony, no pygmy imitator or empty conformist, but one who lived in rich power
from his own original centres and let his qualities honestly out with democratic
sincerity of self-assertion.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Mr Phelps has opened the campaign with two plays of
Shakespeare&mdash;<hi rend="italic">As You Like It</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi> The former of these we have not
yet seen, but of the <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> we can speak from our own knowledge. Here as
ever the first mention is due to the whole truth and harmony of the representation.
The actors are all in accord together; and although the company includes few
bright particular stars, yet each does justice to the dignity of his profession. Mr
Barrett is a genial and genuine Menenius Agrippa; Mr Hermann Vezin, a new
member of the company, who, we believe, had earned honours as first tragedian
in a transpontine house, is a discreet and serious Aufidius, who mars nothing by
errors of commission, and errs only on the hopeful side by under-acting of his part.
The Roman mob, admirably grouped and disciplined, cannot possibly be repre-
sented by a better First Citizen than Mr Lewis Ball.</p>
<p>The little part of the household friend and gossip of the women in the hero's
household is spoken delightfully by Mrs Marston. Miss Kate Saxon, an intelli-
gent actress, who supplies one of the losses of the company, delivers with all due
simplicity the few sentences that fall to her lot as the wife of Coriolanus, and
expresses quietly by her stage bearing the modest, faithful gentleness that follows,
strong in love, the warrior's career. As the proud mother of the prouder son, Miss
Atkinson also labours her best, but she does not achieve her best. When she
desires with face and gesture to express scorn, it not seldom happens that she fails
to suggest more than intensity of spite. For this reason her Volumnia is wanting
in some of the dignity with which the character has been invested by the poet.
It is a hard trial, no doubt, to measure the expression of a Roman mother's pride
with the show of pride that a man can put into the part of Coriolanus. Pride,
after all, is not a woman's passion, for what passes by the name is often vanity.</p>
<p>The pride of Coriolanus is heroic, and is a man's pride, from which vanity is
altogether absent. His own praises are irksome in his ears. That which he is,
he is; and it is little in his simple estimation of himself, for he esteems himself by
what he feels the power of becoming. Upon comparisons between himself and the
base multitude he never wastes a thought. It matters not at what level other
men are content to dwell; his mind abides on its own heights. Thus when Caius
Marcius in the camp, beset with irksome praises that he is compelled to hear, is
named Coriolanus, and there is added to this honour that exhortation, &lsquo;Bear the
addition nobly ever,&rsquo; Mr Phelps represents him stirred by the warning into a large
<pb n="734"/>

sense of what is in his soul, and lifted upon tiptoe by his soaring thought. The
same action gives grandeur to the words,
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;I'd rather be their servant in my way<lb/>
Than sway with them in theirs,&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
and is afterwards more than once used, not ostentatiously, and never without
giving the emphasis intended.</p>
<p>As in the action of the piece that pomp of processions with the constant noise
of drum and trumpet which in the good old days of the drama formed a prominent
part of the play is subdued, and made to follow instead of leading the march of
the poem, so in the action of Coriolanus himself it is remembered that heroic pride
is self-contained. The passion least to be concealed by it is impatience of subjec-
tion to the shifting voices of the mob. The pride of Coriolanus is a virtue over-
grown, and is associated with the utmost purity and tenderness of home affections;
next to his love of home. The two qualities belong naturally to the same mind, and
in the end of this play we are left unable to determine which feeling has prevailed.
It is meant, doubtless, to be questionable whether love would have conquered
had not the mother made her son&mdash;as Mr Phelps does not forget to mark very
distinctly&mdash;flinch at such a pleading as,
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Say, my request's unjust,<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
And spurn me back: but, if it be not so,<lb/>
Thou art not honest.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi></p>
<p>The expulsion of Coriolanus from Rome is presented in a capital stage picture
by the grouping of the mob, and here the actor's reading of his part is marked very
distinctly. He had been wrung by the urgency of his friends and the commands
of his mother to attempt to flatter into quiet the excited mob. The attempt to
do this is presented with all signs of suppressed passion, and impatient, yet in
itself almost heroic, endurance of what is really intense torture. When the tri-
bune calls Coriolanus traitor, he recoils as from a blow, and lets his wrath have
way. But when the mob raising their staves expel him from the city, he mounts
proudly the steps from which as from his mental height he looks down on them,
and he is lord of himself, lord as he feels of Rome. With a sublimity of disdain
he retorts on them that &lsquo;I banish you&rsquo; which Edmund Kean erred in delivering
with an ungovernable passion.</p>
<p>The scenic effect of the view of Antium by the light of the rising moon, when
the banished Coriolanus haunts the door of Aufidius, his deadly enemy, is con-
trived to give colour to the poetry. But there is no scene in the play more im-
pressive to the eye than the succeeding picture of the muffled figure of Coriolanus
seated by the glowing embers of the brazier that represents his enemy's hearth.
It is one of the omissions of Mr Vezin that he makes no sign whatever when the
stranger-guest discloses his name, though he had vowed that
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Where I find him, were it<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,<lb/>
Against the hospitable canon, would I<lb/>
Wash my fierce hand in his heart.&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
If nothing more were to be done, hands tightly clenched at the hearing of the
name, slowly relaxing till they are held out in friendship with the words,
<pb n="735"/>

<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;O Marcius, Marcius,<lb rend="RIGHT"/>
Each word thou has spoke hath weeded from my heart<lb/>
A root of ancient envy,&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
would be better than absolute inaction.</p>
<p>We must not dwell much longer upon this performance. Let us add only that
the meaning of the heroic close furnished by Shakespeare to the play is well
brought out at Sadler's Wells. The lofty pride that when defied by Rome had
defied Rome herself, and was to set a foot upon the neck of the world's ruler, had,
after painful struggle, knelt at the voice of a mother, yielding nobly when to yield
was dangerous, if not mortal. When Coriolanus has attained his greatest height,
Aufidius, fallen to his lowest, has sunk into a dastardly chief of assassins. All
hearts are thus secured for sympathy with the pride with which, as Mr Phelps
shows us, the hero resents the taunt of an enemy basely triumphant. His whole
frame enlarges, and his hands press on the expanding breast as he cries
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart,<lb/>
Too great for what contains it!&rsquo;<lb/>
</hi>
And so at last the loftiness of his disdain carries all sympathies with it when he
whets the swords of the conspirators by telling them
<hi rend="blockquote">
&lsquo;How, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I<lb/>
Fluttered your Volsces in Corioli:<lb/>

<quote><p> Hitherto I had had no opportunity of seeing <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>
on the stage, but during this Spring there were to be two productions of the tragedy.
The first of these was by R. F. Benson at the Comedy Theatre, during February,
and in that I was exceedingly disappointed. I had not expected Benson to be an
ideal Caius Marcius (with his personality that was hardly possible), but I was
surprised to find his conception both of the character and of the play so completely
unlike mine. The work is a difficult one to arrange for representation&mdash;it is very
long and needs extensive compression, and, although much can be easily spared,
a good deal that we would gladly keep has also to be sacrificed. Still, it has
always appeared to me that of <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> a version could be arranged exhilarating,
full of movement, and appealing strongly to our sympathies.</p>
<p>As represented at the Comedy the play was often dull, and never for a moment
did Caius dominate the scene as he does when one studies the play, nor did the
crowds excite the spectator as they do the reader. Benson was not big enough for
Caius&mdash;not big enough either in personality, in power, or inches, and without a
convincing Caius we cannot have a successful <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus.</hi> Nevertheless, I shall
always look back upon two performances in this representation with the utmost
satisfaction, and I place them amongst my happiest remembrances. The first of
these was the Volumnia of Genevieve Ward, than which I can imagine nothing
finer&mdash;she was the ideal embodiment of the Roman mother who loved her son
beyond everything in the world, except only her country. Splendid was her
portrayal of each phase of the character, its pride, its anger, its love, and its despair.
The Sicinius Velutus of Oscar Asche was in its way almost equally good&mdash;strong,
coarse-minded, selfish and cunning, he represented to perfection the contemptible

creature the author intended. I can still see him, after the expulsion of Coriolanus,
seated on a stone in the Roman street, contentedly peeling and eating an orange.
Lyall Swete was a good Menenius, Brydone was Aufidius, and Lilian Braith-
waite, Virgilia. The play was arranged in five acts and twelve scenes.</p>

<quote> Shakespeare at the Lyceum is always a magnificent spectacle,
and <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus,</hi> the last Shakespearean revival there, was a magnificent spectacle.
It is a play made up principally of one character and a crowd, the crowd being a
sort of moving background, treated in Shakespeare's large and scornful way.
A stage crowd at the Lyceum always gives one a sense of exciting movement, and
this Roman rabble did all that was needed to show off the almost solitary splendour
of Coriolanus. He is the proudest man in Shakespeare, and Sir Henry Irving is
at his best when he embodies pride. His conception of the part was masterly;
it had imagination, nobility, quietude. With opportunity for ranting in every
second speech, he never ranted, but played what might well have been a roaring
part with a kind of gentleness. With every opportunity for extravagant gesture,
he stood, as the play seemed to foam about him, like a rock against which the
foam beats. Made up as a kind of Roman Moltke, the lean, thoughtful soldier,
he spoke throughout with a slow, contemptuous enunciation, as of one only just
not too lofty to sneer. Restrained in scorn, he kept throughout an attitude of
disdainful pride, the face, the eyes, set while only his mouth twitched, seeming to
chew his words, with the disgust of one swallowing a painful morsel. Where other
actors would have raved, he spoke with bitter humour, a humour that seemed to
hurt the speaker, the concise, active humour of the soldier, putting his words
rapidly into deeds. And his pride was an intellectual pride; the weakness of a
character, but the angry dignity of a temperament. I have never seen Irving so
restrained, so much an artist, so faithfully interpretative of a masterpiece. Some-
thing of energy, no doubt, was lacking; but everything was there except the em-
phasis which I most often wish away in acting.</quote></cit>

<quote> Irving's thirteenth, and last, Shakespearean character at
the Lyceum was Coriolanus. The revival took place on 15th April, 1901. It sig-
nalised his return to the theatre after an absence of nearly nine months. As readers
of this book are aware, he had contemplated the production as far back as the
year 1882, when he had employed Mr (as he then was) Alma Tadema for the design-
ing of the scenery and costumes. This artist was responsible for the designs in
1901, and the music for the revival was composed by Sir A. C. Mackenzie. Irving
in short, had not lost the art of stage-production, but his own personality was as
unsuited for the part of Coriolanus as was that of Miss Ellen Terry to Volumnia.
There were one or two admirable passages in Irving's impersonation. In the second
act, for instance, the contempt which he infused into the line, &lsquo;Well, mildly be it&mdash;
mildly,&rsquo; was remarkable in its concentration. In the last act, the scene where
Coriolanus is in disguise outside Aufidius's house, was a fine example of the pro-
found melancholy which was so marked a feature, when it was necessary, of Irving's
acting. But he was not the Roman soldier of tradition any more than Miss Terry
was the Roman matron. The handling of the stage-crowds was magnificent.
<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is not the kind of play which could be expected to have a long run, and
the thirty-six consecutive performances at the Lyceum, small by comparison with
Irving's other Shakespearean revivals, constitute a record for the tragedy.</quote></cit>

<quote><p> On the 15th April Irving produced <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> at the Lyceum,
and I cannot but regret that he did so, for his Coriolanus was not in my judgment
on the same plane of artistic grandeur as were his other Shakespearean creations.
I do not think the part is one that could, under the happiest auspices, have ranked
among his great successes; the character is not a complex psychological study, and,
although Caius may well be supposed to have possessed a magnetic personality,
among the vital requisites for portraying the part are a ringing voice and soldierly
physique. Salvini is the most likely Coriolanus I can think of, but although it is
difficult to name an ideal actor for the part, there are, I think, several infinitely
lesser artists than Irving who would have acted the part better. It must, how-
ever, be remembered that during 1901-2 the great actor was struggling against
misfortune and illness, and was unfitted to grapple with such an exacting under-
taking as the portrayal of a long and exhausting new part. It seems doubtful,
too, whether he was wholly in sympathy with the character. For Caius to interest
and move an audience the part must surely be approached from the point of view
of the Patricians, and Irving appeared to view it from the standpoint of the
Plebeians. He conveyed an idea of his fearlessness, of his pride, and of his superior
intellect, but he did not present a man who would have been beloved even by his
fellow nobles. It is needless to say there were numberless touches of rare thought
throughout the representation, and although the great scene of supplication in
the last act was strangely ineffective, that with his mother and friends before he
goes to face the incensed people (Act III, Scene 2 in the printed version) was a
gem of acting that only Henry Irving could have given us. I did not much like
the arrangement of the play. Like Benson, Irving cut the whole of the fighting
scenes before Corioli, and difficult as such scenes are in representation, they are
in some form necessary to bring vividly before the spectator the vast superiority
to his companions of Caius as a soldier, and the soundness of his reasons for despis-
ing the common people. At the Lyceum, however, the omission was doubtless
inevitable, for Irving's strength could not have born the strain of such scenes.
Ellen Terry looked lovely and moved with all her customary grace as Volumnia,
but she was too young and not in the least like a Roman matron&mdash;she was little
more than Ellen Terry in Roman attire. Barnes as Menenius was disappointing,
but Tyars was good, and Mabel Hackney looked gentle and pretty. The scenery
was designed by Alma Tadema, and its beauty may be imagined.</p></quote></cit></div2>

<quote><p> Salvini had never acted Coriolanus before
he assumed the part in New York. He says, in his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography,</hi> that his reason
for not acting the part in Italy was that the tragedy &lsquo;demands too costly a stage
setting, and it was impossible to secure in the great number of assistants that
artistic discipline without which the grandiose easily merges in the ridiculous,&rsquo;
and he adds, with that tiresome patronage and complacent condescension which
foreigners so frequently bestow on America and Americans, &lsquo;I regret this&rsquo; (his
inability, for the reasons assigned, to present the play in Italy) &lsquo;very much, as my
compatriots would have given me an unbiassed and intellectual judgment of the
work.&rsquo; <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> and <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> are plays much more difficult to cast properly than
<hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi> is, yet Salvini produced both of them in Italy. It is interesting, how-
ever, that the illustrious Italian felt constrained to admit that the latter tragedy
could be better cast, in the subsidiary parts, in this artistically benighted land
than in the Theatre of Italy, which, being foreign, is, of course, so much superior

to ours! Perhaps he deemed it inconsequent how the play was acted here, assum-
ing that nobody would know the difference. He further remarks that he had been
attracted to the study of &lsquo;the banished and vindictive hero Coriolanus&rsquo; because
&lsquo;I felt that I could divine that character, which resembled my own in some ways&mdash;
not, certainly, in his warlike exploits, but in his susceptibility, in his spurning of
the arrogance and insolent pretensions of the ignorant masses, and, above all,
in his filial submissiveness and affection.&rsquo; His personation, while not extraordinary
in comparison with those with which the American Stage was familiar, was thor-
oughly good. In appearance he was a huge, bearded warrior, more barbarian
than Roman. He had authority, repose, and cumulative force; it is always a
comfort to see an actor who can sustain and execute a splendid design, consistently,
from beginning to end. That Salvini could do, and that, in this case, he did. In
the first scene with the discontented, clamorous citizens he delivered the harangue
(&lsquo;He that will give good words to thee will flatter,&rsquo; etc.) in a moderate tone and
with almost jocular sarcasm; this, certainly, is not a correct manner, since the
spirit of the speech is bitter and the utterance denunciatory. In requesting
clemency and relief for the poor man of Corioli, who &lsquo;used me kindly,&rsquo; he paused
when asked for his name, seemed to weaken from the effect of his wounds, and,
smiling, smote his forehead and shook his head, as he answered &lsquo;By Jupiter!
forgot!&rsquo; This detail, entirely correct, was extravagantly admired by some of the
actor's idolaters; the wonder is that it should have excited any comment. How
any actor could fail to make a fine effect at that point is not easy to comprehend.
&lsquo;The property of fire is to burn and of water to wet,&rsquo; says Touchstone. The
salutation to Volumnia and Virgilia was spoken with affecting gentleness; the
salutation to Valeria was omitted. The denunciation of the Roman mob, &lsquo;You
common cry of curs!&rsquo; etc., was uttered with a smile of contempt and with fine
vigor. In the parting from his family&mdash;&lsquo;when I am forth, bid me farewell and
smile,&rsquo; etc.&mdash;there was deep pathos, as also there was in the outburst of passion,
&lsquo;O mother, mother! what have you done!&rsquo; in the scene of submission. The com-
pany supporting Salvini spoke in English. Aufidius was performed by his son
Alexander and Virgilia by Viola Allen, who gave a graceful and pleasing personation
of that slight part.</p></quote></cit></div2></div1>

<p>These last twenty-five editions I have not collated beyond referring to them in
disputed passages, and recording, here and there in the <hi rend="italic">Commentary,</hi> the views of
their editors.</p>
<p>Within the last forty years&mdash;indeed, since the appearance, in 1864, of the <hi rend="italic">Globe
Edition</hi>&mdash;the text of Shakespeare is become so settled that to collate word for
word the text of editions which have appeared within this term would be a fruit-
less task. When, however, within recent years an editor revises his text in a
second or third edition, the case is different; it then becomes interesting to mark the
effect of maturer judgment. The present <hi rend="smallcap">Text</hi> is that of the First Folio of 1623.</p>
<p>In the <hi rend="smallcap">Textual Notes</hi> the symbol Ff indicates the agreement of the <hi rend="italic">Second,
Third,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fourth Folios.</hi>
<pb n="741"/>
</p>
<p>I have not called attention to every little misprint in the Folio. The <hi rend="italic">Textual Notes</hi>
will show, if need be, that they are misprints by the agreement of all the Editors in
their corrections.</p>
<p>Nor is notice taken of the first editor who adopted the modern spelling, or who
substituted commas for parentheses, or changed ? to !.</p>
<p>The sign + indicates the agreement of <hi rend="smallcap">Rowe, Pope, Theobald, Hanmer,
Warburton, Johnson</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Variorum of</hi> 1773. This sign following Cam. in-
dicates the agreement of <hi rend="smallcap">Globe, Clarendon</hi>, and <hi rend="smallcap">Wh.</hi> ii.</p>
<p>When in the <hi rend="italic">Textual Notes</hi> <hi rend="smallcap">Warburton</hi> precedes <hi rend="smallcap">Hanmer</hi>, it indicates that
<hi rend="smallcap">Hanmer</hi> has followed a suggestion of <hi rend="smallcap">Warburton</hi>.</p>
<p>The words &lsquo;Mnemonic Pope, Warb., Han.&rsquo; in the <hi rend="italic">Textural Notes</hi> signify that
the passage indicated is marked by those editors as especially worthy of attention
or memorising.</p>
<p>The words <hi rend="italic">et cet.</hi> after any reading indicate that it is the reading of <hi rend="italic">all other</hi>
editions.</p>
<p>The words <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi> indicate the agreement of <hi rend="italic">all subsequent</hi> editions.</p>
<p>The abbreviation (<hi rend="italic">subs.</hi>) indicates that the reading is <hi rend="italic">substantially</hi> given, and
that immaterial variations in spelling, punctuation, or stage-directions are disre-
garded.</p>
<p>When <hi rend="italic">Varr.</hi> precedes <hi rend="italic">Steev.</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mal.,</hi> it includes the <hi rend="italic">Variorums of</hi> 1773, 1778, and
1785; when it follows <hi rend="italic">Steev.</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mal.,</hi> it includes the <hi rend="italic">Variorums of</hi> 1803, 1813, and
1821.</p>
<p>An emendation or correction given in the <hi rend="italic">Commentary</hi> is not repeated in the
<hi rend="italic">Textual Notes</hi> unless it has been adopted by an editor in his text; nor is <hi rend="italic">conj.</hi> added
in the <hi rend="italic">Textual Notes</hi> to the name of the proposer of the conjecture unless the con-
jecture happens to be that of an editor, in which case its omission would lead to
the inference that such was the reading of his text.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">Coll. MS.</hi> refers to <hi rend="smallcap">Collier's</hi> copy of the Second Folio, bearing in its margin
manuscript annotations.</p>
<p>In citing plays or quoting from them, the Acts, Scenes, and Lines of the <hi rend="italic">Globe
Edition</hi> are followed, unless otherwise noted. Of course, all references to <hi rend="italic">Coriolanus</hi>
refer to the present text.

<div1 type="section" n="LIST OF BOOKS"><head>LIST OF BOOKS</head>
<p>To economise space in the foregoing pages, as a general rule merely the name
of an author has been given, followed, in parentheses, by the number of volume
and page.</p>
<p>In the following <hi rend="smallcap">List</hi>, arranged alphabetically, enough of the full titles is set
forth to serve the purposes of either identification or reference.</p>
<p>Be it understood that this <hi rend="smallcap">List</hi> does not include those books which have been
consulted or used in verifying references; were these included, the list would be
many times longer.
