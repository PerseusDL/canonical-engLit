<p>IN 1560 there was imprinted at London by John Kingston, <quote>and
now newlie sette forthe againe, with a prologue to the reader,</quote> <quote><bibl><title>The
Arte of Rhetorique</title></bibl>, for the use of all such as are studious of
eloquence, set forthe in Englishe, by Thomas Wilson.</quote>  This is not
the first edition.  As is implied in the title the book had been
already issued; it had been published in 1553, beautifully printed in
black letter by Richard Grafton, the king's printer.  For reasons
which will appear hereafter, the last year of Mary's reign had been
a stirring time for the author, and little leisure was left him for
literary tasks.  But with the accession of Elizabeth security and
prosperity returned to him, and he set about preparing a new edition
of his successful textbook.  Much was altered and much added; he
prefaced it by a new prologue of much personal interest.  Towards
the end of the year the corrected and completed book was issued
from the press.  It was reprinted in 1562, 1563, and 1567, and
indeed frequently down to about the year of the Great Armada, when
apparently, whether owing to the advent of newer textbooks or to
the changing taste of a more fastidious and sophisticated period we
cannot know, it fell out of demand and public esteem and gradually
ceased to be reprinted.  <bibl><title>The Arte of Rhetorique</title></bibl>, then, was in its day
a work of great popularity; it passed through numerous editions and
was eagerly read by two generations of seekers after eloquence and
literary skill, and then slipped gently back into the night, gathering
the dust of unused bookshelves.  But a day arrives when the obsolete
becomes again alive and interesting.  A modern finds little to
choose between the book that has been superseded and its successor;
he loves them both for their strangeness and for the picture which
they suggest to him of forgotten habits of thought.  Antiquity gilds
dullness; stupidity becomes amiable in dead men.  It is not,<reg orig="how-ever">however</reg>,
the undiscriminating zeal of the antiquary or the mere delight

in quaintness for quaintness' sake that has suggested the reprinting
of this book.  It is in its way a landmark in the history of the
English Renaissance, and many passages in it are important and
indeed indispensable to the historian of English literature.  This has
long been known; the book was styled by Warton <quote>The first
system of criticism in our language</quote>; but so far to all but a few it
has been accessible only in extracts and these not representative.
There is so much that is of interest in the mass that is forgotten, so
much that explains and interprets many aspects of Elizabethan art,
as to make this reprint of some service perhaps to those who are
studying the period.  The book appeared in an age of busy and
eager experiment when many conflicting fashions were struggling for
the mastery both in prose and in verse.  Its author was no<reg orig="peda-gogue">pedagogue</reg>
remote from the live issues of the time.  He was a courtier and
a statesman as well as a writer and a scholar; on many of the
problems which emerged from the turmoil of literary effort he had
strong opinions, and the mark of them is left on his work.  The
student of Tudor literature may find it worth his while to hear what
an alert and cultured contemporary has [to] say on these matters.</p>

<p>Thomas Wilson, the author (dignified by many as Sir Thomas
Wilson, though he was never knighted) was born about the year
1525.  He was a Lincolnshire man, the son of another Thomas
Wilson of Strubby in that county and Anne Cumberworth his wife.
He himself disclaims any pride in his native shire, and when
Lincoln folk are mentioned in his books it is generally for their
stupidity.  He had all the Elizabethan's impatience of rusticity and
dullness, all the contempt which London and the court felt for the
country.  <quote>It is better,</quote> he says, <quote>to be borne in London then in
Lincolne.  For that the aire is better, the people more ciuill, and the
wealth much greater and the men for the most part more wise</quote>.
<note place="foot" anchored="yes">P. 13 inf.</note>
Yet he owed much to the neighbours of his early home.  One of
them, William Cecil, Lord Burghley, did much to promote Wilson
to the honourable state employment of his later years.  There are
others who deserve no less mention -- Katherine Willoughby,

Duchess of Suffolk, with whom his friendship was firm and lifelong
and about whom we shall hear presently; and Sir Edward Dymock,
who helped him both at the University and later, and at whose
house <bibl><title>The Arte of Rhetorique</title></bibl> was written during a holiday visit.</p>

<p>Thomas Wilson was educated first at Eton; in 1541 he became
a scholar of King's College, Cambridge.  The time and the<reg orig="cir-cumstances">circumstances</reg>
were fortunate.  During his residence there Sir John
Cheke was chosen provost, and Wilson was thus thrown into contact
with what was at once the most progressive and the most national
side of English Humanism.  Through Cheke and Sir Thomas Smith
(himself a member of King's and afterwards his predecessor in the
Secretaryship of State) he gained the friendship of Roger Ascham;
through them, too, he became intimate with Walter Haddon,
another member of the coterie and the most distinguished Latinist of
his time.  With him Wilson collaborated in his earliest book.
Before he left Cambridge he had become one of a school of men
who, by their scholarship and the individuality of their opinions, did
much to mould the course of the Renaissance in England on its
pedagogic side, and who had no inconsiderable influence on the
development of English prose.  From them he learned the lesson of
simplicity and his horror of exaggerated Latinism.  He fought side
by side with them in the crusade against inkhorn terms, and he bore
the brunt of the battle.  For whereas Ascham confined himself to
the practice of teaching and the composition of dialogues which
contain precepts in style only by the way; whereas Haddon distilled
from his pen poetical effusions in the learned tongues and Cheke's
influence was exerted through personal contact only, Wilson set
himself in his textbooks on Logic and Rhetoric to provide sure
guidance for the aspiring student who was anxious to acquire what
the new learning had to give him.  Through him the teaching of
Cheke and Ascham found its way to a wider circle of disciples than
either of these could command.</p>

<p>At Cambridge, Wilson formed an attachment which remained
throughout his life his most precious recollection.  We have seen
that in Lincolnshire he enjoyed the friendship and patronage of

Katherine Willoughby, Duchess of Suffolk.  At the University he
became the tutor of her two sons.  Henry and Charles Brandon,
both counted Dukes of Suffolk because in their death one survived
the other by a few hours, made by the brilliancy and high promise of
their talents and the bitter tragedy of their early death a remarkable
impression on their contemporaries.  The elder for a time was
a fellow-pupil with King Edward under Sir John Cheke; but both
during the larger part of their education were under Wilson's care.
It is easy to see how deep was his regard for them; he returns
to their praise again and again, and there is nothing of the<reg orig="con-ventional">conventional</reg>
eulogy which is the due of patronage in his tone.  When
they died, of the sweating sickness, in 1551, he published along
with Walter Haddon a volume of memorial verses and two letters
by way of biography.

The second example, 'Of Comfort,' is addressed to their mother.
<quote>When God lately visited this relme with the sweating disease and
received the two worthie gentlemen, Henrie, Duke of Suffolk and his
brother Lord Charles: I, seeing my Ladies Grace their mother taking
their death most greeuously, could not otherwise for the dutie whiche I
then did, and euer shall owe unto her, but comfort her in that her
heauiness, the whiche undoubtedly at that time much weakened her
bodie.</quote>  There is no mistaking the sincerity of his friendship.  It is
pleasant to read his gratitude for her patronage who was 'by birthe
noble and witte great, of nature gentle and mercifull to the poore, and
to the Godlie and especially to the learned an earnest good patronesse,
and most helping ladie aboue all other'.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1551, which saw his first appearance as an author
in the two epistles, Wilson published his first famous book, <title>The Rule
of Reason, conteyning the Arte of Logike, sette forthe in Englishe
by Thomas Wilson.</title>  In his dedication to King Edward he explains
the reasons which led to its writing and publication.  Hitherto
students of logic have been obliged to have recourse to the ancient
tongues; his object is to provide a textbook <quote>in the vulgar tongue</quote>.
<quote>I take not upon me so cunningly and perfectlie to haue written of
the said arte, as though none could dooe it better; But because no
Englishman untill now, hath gone through with this enterprise, I haue

on Aristotle and makes no pretence at originality.  <quote>I doe herein
take vpon me no more,</quote> he says, <quote>but to be as a poore meane
manne, or a simple persone, whose charge were to bee a Lodesman,

of the book was apparently suggested by Richard Grafton,
the King's printer, who had already helped the author at Cambridge.

after, encouraged by its success to continue his plan of
making the sciences accessible to the unlearned, Wilson published
<bibl><title>The Arte of Rhetorique</title></bibl>.  It was dedicated to John Dudley, Earl of
Warwick and Master of Horse, to whom he tells us its inception was
due.  <quote>For whereas it pleased you, emong other talke of learning,

exists; and the passage from the Dedication above quoted implies some time

<p>His subsequent career must be told in less detail.  Its importance
belongs to political and diplomatic rather than to literary history;
it is written in his dispatches at the Record Office, in State papers
and the like, and could not be adequately treated within the limits
which a preface imposes.  In 1555 the fall of Northumberland
drove him abroad, and he travelled to Italy.  In the same year we
find him with Sir John Cheke in Padua.  Two years later he<reg orig="pro-ceeded">proceeded</reg>

ceeded to Rome, and in December, 1557, he became implicated in
an intrigue at the Papal Court against Cardinal Pole.  In January
he was summoned by Philip and Mary to return to England and
appear before the Privy Council.  There can be no doubt what was
the fate they had in store for him; Wilson apparently recognized
the meaning of the summons; he paid no heed and was arrested in
Rome by the Inquisition on a charge of heresy.  His position was
one of the greatest danger, and only the fortunate accident of an
insurrection in the city prevented his death; apparently he had been
already put to the torture.  The incident is described in a passage
of gravity and dignity in 'The Prologue to the Reader', which he
added to <bibl><title>The [Arte] of Rhetorique</title></bibl> in 1560.<note place="foot" anchored="yes" n="1">See infra.1</note>

The account is too long to quote in full; but it shows that the spirit

LL.D. of Ferrara, an honour which he afterwards received from his
own university and from Oxford.</p>

</p>
<p>From 1560 to the end of his life, Wilson was employed in State
business.  He was appointed Advocate of the Court of Arches and Master
of Requests; he enjoyed the patronage, like so many other men of
letters, of the Earl of Leicester, and he was employed with increasing
frequency on diplomatic missions.  Amongst his other posts he held
that of Master of St. Catherine's Hospital in the Tower of London; his
conduct there seems to have aroused much<reg orig="con-troversy">controversy</reg>.  <quote>Under Queen Elizabeth,</quote> says
Fuller, <note place="foot" anchored="yes">Fuller, ibid.</note> <quote>he was made master of
the hospital of St. Catherine's nigh the Tower of London, upon the
same token that he took down the choir, which my author saith (allow
him a little hyperbole) was as great as the choir of St. Paul's.  I am
loath to believe it done out of covetousness to gain from the
materials thereof, but would rather conceive it so run to ruin that it
was past repairing.</quote>  Fuller's <mentioned>author</mentioned> was Stowe in whose <title><bibl n="Perseus:text:2000.01.0047">Survey of London</bibl>
</title>
the charge against Wilson is made. <reg orig="What-ever">Whatever</reg> the motive which drew him into the
task of house-breaking, he was checked in his destructive career, and
the ancient privileges of the Hospital were apparently confirmed on
the presentation of <quote>an ernest address from the inhabitants to
Secretary Cecyl, complaining unto him against the said Master.</quote><note place="foot" anchored="yes"> Stowe, <bibl n="Perseus:text:2000.01.0047 1.205"><title>Survey of London</title>, vol. 1,
p. 205.</bibl></note> It is unlikely that Stowe is right in alleging his
action to have been for the sake of personal gain.  Fuller's
conjecture is the more charitable.  The trial for treason of the Duke
of Norfolk in 1571 <note place="foot" anchored="yes"><bibl><title>State Trials</title>,

prisoners (under torture) absorbed his attention as a Tower official
and he dates his letters 'from prison in the Bloody tower'.  In the
following year he was sent along with Sir Ralph Sadler 'to expostulate
by way of accusation' with Mary, Queen of Scots.  Two years later he
was ambassador to the<reg orig="Nether-lands">Netherlands</reg>, and
in 1576 conducted the negotiations for the projected marriage of
Elizabeth with Anjou.  On November 12, 1579, he was sworn Secretary of
State in place of Sir Thomas Smith.</p>

</p>
<p>Meanwhile, even under the pressure of State business (and<reg orig="Eliza-bethan">Elizabethan</reg>
officials were hardworked men) his pen was not idle.  As early
as 1556 he and Cheke had formed the project of a translation of
Demosthenes into the English tongue.  In 1570 there was published,
being dedicated on June 10 of that year to William Cecil, 'Three
Orations of Demosthenes, chiefe orator of the Grecians in fauour of
the Olynthians . . . with those his foure Orations against King Philip
of Macedonie; most nedeful to be redde in these daungerous dayes
of all them that loue their countries libertie and desire to take<reg orig="warn-ing">warning</reg>
for their better auayle.'  Wilson is responsible for the whole of
this translation, which is said to attain a high level of scholarship.
As is made clear on the title page the work was intended to have
a political significance.  Philip of Macedon for the Englishman
meant Philip of Spain, and the lesson was enforced by a comparison
of Athens and England in the preface.  It is possible that the
Government through Cecil commissioned Wilson to do the work;
if so, he is the earliest of the long line of English authors who have
used their pens in the service of politics.  To be set side by side
with Milton, Dryden, and Swift, to name only a few, is to be in
no bad company.  In his last publication he turned to the field
of Economics.  In 1572 he dedicated to Leicester 'a discourse on
Usurye, by waye of Dialogue and Oracions'.  The dialogue takes
place between 'a rich worldly merchaunt, the godlie zealous Preacher,
the Temporall and ciuil Lawyer', who in turn make the orations.  As
might be supposed the rich and worldly merchant is confuted and
the godly and zealous preacher triumphs.  Usury is condemned, as
it had been by Aristotle and the Canonists, on moral grounds.  In
doing so the author is expressing the opinion held by his own<reg orig="genera-tion">generation</reg>;
an Act of Parliament utterly forbidding the practice was passed
the year before his treatise was published; at the end of the century
Shakespeare in <bibl n="shak. mv"><title>The Merchant of Venice</title></bibl> takes the same standpoint.
There is no wonder that the book was popular and much relished by
the Church.  In a prefatory letter to the author which appeared in
the edition of 1584 <note place="foot" anchored="yes">Quoted in the <bibl><title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>, 1835, p. 471.</bibl></note>
the Bishop of Salisbury eulogizes the work.

as the good bishop imagined, and modern ears remain<reg orig="alto-gether">altogether</reg>
deaf to his appeal.  These, with a Latin treatise which
perhaps was a translation of part of the preface to Demosthenes, are
all his published works.  Antony Wood refers to 'other things

<p>Wilson became Secretary of State, as we have seen, in 1579; he
did not live above two years to enjoy the office.  While he held it,
he obtained a reputation for great ability and deep policy.  Despite
his long connexion with the Leicester party, he seems to have done
his best to dissuade Elizabeth from identifying herself with it at the

capacity.  Says Fuller, speaking of his secretaryship, 'It argues his

at the papal persecution of his works.  No opportunity is lost of
driving a nail into the coffin of English catholicism.  Examples will
be found on many pages of this book.  The pre-Reformation period
is 'the doting world when stockes were saintes and dumme walls

I thinke the Bishops officers would have procured this matter long

they were like to haue by priestes wiues.'  <title>The Rule of Reason</title> is one
long Protestant tract in which the doctrines of Geneva are enforced
by the apparatus of mediaeval logic.  But though he loved Latimer
as 'the father of all preachers' he was not blind to abuses in his
own Church.  'Doe ye not see, how euery one catcheth and pulleth

<p>The Renaissance did not come to pass in a night.  The forms of
teaching and schemes of knowledge which we associate with the
Middle Ages subsisted for long side by side with the new learning.
It is the mediaeval division of arts and sciences which we find in
Wilson's work.  When he says in his preface to the <title>Arte of Logike</title>,
that 'divers learned menne, of other countries, have heretofore, for
furtheraunce of knowledge, not suffered any of the sciences liberals,
to be hidden in the Greke or Latine tongue, but haue with most
earnest trauaile, made every of them familiare to their Vulgar
people', the liberal sciences he is thinking of are no other than the
famous seven of mediaeval pedagogy.  Later on in the book, he
runs them into a rude kind of rime for the benefit of the learner.

<p>All that the new zeal for learning worked for in the first instance,
and all that Wilson pretended to do, was to make these accessible
in the vernacular.  Along with this went the breaking up of the
older cyclopaedic system and the beginning of separate textbooks
for each subject.
</p>
<p>This is, however, only half the truth of the matter.  Though

<pb n="xvii"/>

<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">xvii</fw>

the historian must needs deny the cleavage once imagined between
the old and the new, the theory of a kind of tropical dawn, a sudden
passage from light to darkness, he must admit that the change of
outlook and purpose of life which we call the Renaissance, though it
was gradual, was none the less complete.  It meant a new beginning
for the artist and the author as well as for the theologian, the
adventurer, and the statesman.  In the Middle Ages the<reg orig="ground-work">groundwork</reg>
of thought and letters was logic.  It extended to every<reg orig="depart-ment">department</reg>
of culture.  Works of piety and the poetry of love, to take
two of the largest and simplest kinds of writing, were founded on a
logical attitude towards things.  In the schools it was supreme; the
trivium was threefold only in name; dialectic overshadowed both
rhetoric and grammar.  With the Renaissance, however, a complete
revolution took place.  Logic gradually went under, and rhetoric,
reinforced by the reading of authors, took the highest place in the
curriculum.  What happened in education happened also in literature.
The reading of the ancients awakened a new delight in the melody
of language: men became intoxicated with the beauty of words.
The practice and study of rhetoric was quickly universal and coloured
all literature.  The new drama, with its preference for declamatory
speeches over dialogue; the new prose, with its fantasy and its
exuberance of figure; the new poetry, with its mythological<reg orig="allusive-ness">allusiveness</reg>
and its sensuousness of imagery, all owe their origin to the fashion
of rhetoric.  'Unless the school and university training in rhetoric
are borne in mind, an important factor in accounting for the wealth
of imagery and expression in the English literature of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries is overlooked.'<note place="foot" anchored="yes" n="1">Prof. Foster Watson, <title>The English Grammar Schools to 1660</title>.</note>  <title>Tamburlaine</title> and <title>Lucrece</title>,
<title>Arcadia</title> and <title>Euphues</title>, a host of sonneteers -- all come to the mind.
It is no mere accident that Wilson's long translation of Erasmus's
epistle to persuade a young gentleman to marriage reminds one of
the first part of Shakespeare's sonnets.  The same literary impulse
dictated both.  The order of his two treatises and the greater
popularity of the <title>Rhetorique</title> represent a fact in the development of
literature and thought.</p>

</p>
<p>This is hardly the place in which to attempt a detailed history of
the study of rhetoric in England,<note place="foot" anchored="yes" n="1">The thing has in some degree been done by Professor Foster Watson's recent
book, <title>The English Grammar Schools to 1660</title>.  Most of the above was written before
I had an opportunity of reading it, but I have ventured to add one or two points
from it which had escaped my own reading.</note> but some of the most prominent
books and writers may be briefly noticed.  Of course a large part of
the study of rhetoric was carried on directly from the ancient
writers; notably Cicero whom Ascham praised and held superior to all
others of learning rhetoric, and Quintilian, the idol of the teachers of
that time.  But the use of modern works was more usual.  There
were two books in the vulgar tongue before Wilson's: Cox's <title>Arte or
Crafte of Rhetorique</title> and Sherry's <title>Treatise of the figures of Grammar and
Rhetoric, profitable for all that be studious of eloquence</title>.  They were both
schoolbooks, pure and simple.  Wilson does not seem to have known
them; at any rate, in writing his treatise in English, he professes an
innovation.  Later Abraham Fraunce, author of several books for
lawyers, published his <title>Arcadian Rhetoric</title> (1588), designed to show
the beauties of Sir Philip Sidney's <title>Arcadia</title>, and Richard Mulcaster
combined Grammar and Rhetoric in one of the most popular
treatises of the day.  This combination was one of the most
fortunate features in Tudor Education.  Grammar was studied
in the sixteenth century more broadly than it has been, perhaps,
before or since.  Both Ascham in his <title>Scholemaster</title> and Elyot in his
<title>Grammar</title> minimize the importance of the formalities of grammatical
study.  'Back to Quintilian,' the great ideal for which the
Renaissance educationalists worked, means nothing so much as this,
that grammar could not be studied independently of literature.  The
growth of rhetorical teaching went steadily on and for the<reg orig="seven-teenth">seventeenth</reg>
century we have more information.  Brinsley's <title>Ludus<reg orig="Litter-arius">Litterarius</reg></title>,
or <title>Grammar schoole</title> (1612), and Hoole's <title>New discovery of the old
art of teaching schoole</title> (1659), give many interesting particulars.
We learn the way rhetoric was taught; how the pupils kept a book
with the headings of invention under which they entered subjects for
exercise.  We learn, too, much regarding the textbooks generally



<pb n="xix"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">Introduction.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">xix</fw>

used in schools, none of which were in English.  The most popular
(it was greatly admired by Gabriel Harvey) appears to have been
that of a Frenchman of the name of Talon who latinized himself as
Talaeus.  'For answering the questions of Rhetorike,' says Brinsley
in one place, 'you may if you please, make them perfect in Talaeus'
<title>Rhetorike</title>, which I take to be most used in schools.'  He was run
hard by English competitors, the chief of whom was Charles Butler,
a member of Magdalen College, who published his <title>Rhetoric&aelig; Libri Duo</title>
in 1598.  In a later edition he quotes by way of preface the eulogy
bestowed upon him by Brinsley, 'Instead of Talaeus you may use
Master Butler's <title>Rhetorike</title>, of <mentioned>Magdalens</mentioned> in Oxford, being a notable
abridgement of Talaeus; making it most plaine and farre more easie
to bee learned of scholers: and also supplying many things wanting
in Talaeus . . . it is not of much greater price though the worth be
double.'  Brinsley commends it further for its treatment of the
figures belonging to poetry, and for its rules as to metre.  One
other famous book on Rhetoric deserves notice.  This is Thomas
Farnaby's <title>Index Rhetoricus</title>, a small but exceedingly well-constructed
book.  Like Wilson, its author had an adventurous career, for he
began life as a postmaster at Merton College, and after sailing with
Drake and Raleigh to the Main, and serving as a soldier in the Low
Countries, settled down to his profession as an usher in a Devonshire
school.  Three years after he had commenced teaching, he was<reg orig="head-master">headmaster</reg>
of a large school of his own in London, with three hundred
pupils and an educational system which was famous all over Europe.
His <title>Index</title> he dedicated to a senator of Venice; it had a continental
as well as an English reputation.  Of the others, and they are legion,
there is no space here to deal at length and there is little profit and
much tedium in a mere catalogue.  Many will be found treated in
Warton's <title>History of Poetry</title>, which is, much more than its name
implies, a history of all branches of literature, and which is
particularly well informed on this period.</p>

<p>All these textbooks owe their system and their terminology
to the ancient writers.  Wilson is no exception to the rule.  His
book is a judicious compilation from Quintilian as far as the first two

<pb n="xx"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">xx</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">Introduction.</fw>

books are concerned, while the third owes almost as much to Cicero.
Yet the charge of plagiarism would be an idle one to prefer.  The
Elizabethans had none of our modern squeamishness about literary
copyright, as the whole result of the study into Shakespeare's sources
sadly witnesses.  The words of the Player king in <title>Hamlet.</title>

 <hi rend="blockquote">          <cit><quote>Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own,</quote><bibl n="shak. ham 3.2">shak. ham 3.2.223</bibl></cit>
</hi>

sum up the author's point of view.  And in writing on such a subject
as Rhetoric there is a double excuse, for a science must have a
received terminology, and it lies not with every new artist to invent
new names for his colours or the processes that he uses.  The terms
and divisions of Quintilian were common property among his
Renaissance imitators, and with this caveat we can turn to <title>The Arte
of Rhetorique</title> without the danger of unjust censure.</p>

<p>The first book treats of certain preliminaries, such as what is
an orator, what is rhetoric, with what subjects it deals and what is its
end.  Three things are required of an orator: that he should teach,
that he should delight, and that he should persuade.  The lessons of
plainness, order, and directness are duly enforced, without which it
is impossible either to delight or win over.  The means by which
Eloquence is attained leads the author to point out that the<reg orig="know-ledge">knowledge</reg>
of the art is of no avail without practice, which came before
theory was invented; for 'Rhetorique was first made by wisemen,
and not wisemen by rhetorique'.  Besides practice, five general
qualities are necessary for the perfect orator, Invention, Disposition,
Elocution, Memory, and Utterance.  The first of these is now
systematically treated; and so a detailed account of the different
causes and the 'places' which confirm them completes the first book.
The bulk of it, and the part which is of most interest to readers,
is made up of the numerous examples which the author gives to
enforce his instruction.  Many varied kinds of oration are provided
for the study of the pupil.  Some of these are translated, but the bulk
are from the author's own hand.  Those on comfort we have already
seen.  The translation of Erasmus's epistle persuading a friend
to marriage, and the example of praising King David for killing
Goliath are perhaps the best of the statelier sort.  Some of the

<pb n="xxi"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">Introduction.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">xxi</fw>

judicial speeches, particularly that on p. 92, <emph>to prove by conjectures
the knowledge of a notable and heinous offence, committed by a Souldier</emph>,
when he forgets the solemnity of the occasion and begins to tell his
story, are not without a kind of merit, though they show an entire
ignorance of the rules of evidence.  As a whole, however, the examples
are of no great worth, as even the writer of an essay in praise
of the book is bound to confess.  His precept is unimpeachable,
but plainness and directness, at once the most sought after and
the most elusive of all literary qualities, are not so easily come by in
practice, and cannot be had save by much striving.  Moderns when
they essay to write on the subject generally take their examples from
authors of standing.  We may admire Wilson for his courage in
taking the bolder course of original composition, but we cannot help
questioning his discretion.</p>

<p>The second book deals with Disposition, and in it the author gets
to much closer grips with his subject.  His method is to take each
different part of an oration and discuss the various ways in which it
may be treated.  He begins with the Entrance, which may be
treated in two ways, either the orator may plainly set forth what
he is going to say and so win straight to the matter on hand or else
he may proceed by insinuation, gaining his hearers' attention by
some tale or by some strange thing, 'that they all may quake at the
onely hearing of the same'.  His examples are aptest for pleading at
the bar, but many will serve for the clergy also, of whose preaching
he has a poor opinion; for often, he says 'they beginne as much
from the matter as it is betwixt Dover and Barwicke, whereat some
take pitie and many for wearinesse can scant abide their beginning,
it is so long or they speake anything to the purpose'.  Next comes
Narration which should be brief, plain, and probable, and then
Division which should declare the points at issue between the orator
and his adversary.  The Confirmation in which he must prove
his point and the Conclusion in which he should sum all up for
the benefit of the hearers complete the scheme.  There follows
a discussion of the figure Amplification, that is a storing of sentences
and examples which shall help to win favour or move affections.

<fw place="top-right" type="head">Introduction.</fw>

Under this head we get Wilson's treatment of Mirth and Laughter
and the best means by which these may be used by the rhetorician.
Elocution, Memory, and Utterance are dealt with in the third
and last book.  Of these the first consists in an account of the
Figures or Tropes, largely based on Cicero, each furnished with
examples, mainly from the classical writers.  The sections on Memory
and Utterance, as they are the last, are also the best part of the
book.  In them he is less bound by his models; his hand is freer and
has gained in expertness; the clumsiness of style which tries the
reader's patience in the earlier parts is absent, because his subject
holds him more imperiously than before.  They may be commended
to those who wish to see Wilson at his best.  It is not great prose,
but it is vigorous, living, and unaffected, and it comes nearer to
fulfilling the precepts of its author than anything else in the <title>Arte of
Rhetorique</title>.</p>

<p>The formalities of Rhetoric are no more cheerful reading in
Wilson than in any other author who treats of the subject.
Fortunately the space at his disposal allowed him much opportunity
for wandering a little from the matter at hand and giving his verdict on
men and things.  Many of his friends are mentioned or alluded
to in his pages.  A reference to Latimer we have already seen;
Walter Haddon is the best 'Latine man' in England.  Sir John
Cheke's arrival at Cambridge from the court to take up the<reg orig="provost-ship">provostship</reg>
of King's College gives occasion for one of the best anecdotes in
the book (p. 164).  The proverbs of Heywood, 'whose paines
in that behalf are worthy immortal praise,' are mentioned with
eulogy more than once.  Ascham is not named, but we learn that
'bowes are not esteemed as they haue beene among vs Englishmen,
but if we were once well beaten by our enemies, we should soone
know the want, and with feeling the smart, lament much our folly',
and it is plain enough where he learned these doctrines.  Passing
from his personal references to his opinions and prejudices, the
reader is most struck, perhaps, by the Protestant zeal which we have
already noticed and which shines through every page of the book.
But the statesman is there as well as the reformer.  The direction

<pb n="xxiii"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">Introduction.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">xxiii</fw>

and reorganization of industry which ended in the Statute of
Apprentices and the proceedings in check of vagrancy are both
treated of under the head of Justice or True Dealing.  'Thankes
be to God, wee hang them apace, that offend a lawe, and therefore,
wee put it to their choyce, whether they wilbe idle, and so fall
to stealing or no? they knowe their reward, goe to it when they wil.
But if therewithal some good order were taken for the education of
youth, and setting loyterers on worke (as thanks be to God, the
Citie is most godlie bent that way) all would sone be well, without
all doubt.'  The inclosure of the Common Lands finds in Wilson
a strong supporter.  'Commons or Equalitie,' he says, 'is when the
people by long time have a ground . . . the whiche some of them will
keepe still for custome sake, and not suffer it to be fenced, and so
turned to pasture, though they might gain ten times the value: but
such stubburnesse in keeping of commons for custome sake, is
not standing with justice, bicause it is holden against all right.'  To
comment, however, on the idiosyncrasies and tastes which he
displays to his reader is a work of too great magnitude to be
attempted here; the curious will find material enough on almost
every page.</p>

<p>Besides these the book is enlivened with many anecdotes.  They
serve one of two purposes; either they are meant to enforce a point
or enliven the tedium of his discourse, or else they are given as samples
of the kind of entertainment an orator should interpose to lighten
the effect of the weightier message he has to tell.  Some of them
are of historical or personal interest, such as that of the Spaniard who
watched the burning of a heretic at Smithfield (p. 138), or that of
the rebel priest in Norfolk, or the story of the Cambridge lecturer
who would not face his audience; others are of the perennial sort
which pass from age to age, and from country to country, which find
no difficulty in achieving a local habitation and a name in all climates,
and are not abashed or estranged by any kind of company.  The
story of the sentry and the abbot, for instance, appears from time
to time even in our own day in newspapers; many others are under
the same category.  The author's treatment of his stories is not always

<pb n="xxiv"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">xxiv</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">Introduction.</fw>

free from carelessness of a disconcerting kind.  He sometimes begins
a tale and fails to finish it.  In this way perishes the story of the
archdeacon and the young man, which began with much promise;
the archdeacon had inveighed in the tone of Sir Andrew Aguecheek
against the multitude of heretic and vain preachers: 'You say euen
troth (quoth the yong man) and so went forth: but to tell all, I had
neede to haue time of another world, or at least to haue breath of
another bodie.'  Sometimes he begins a tale for edification and
then his baser nature carries him away and the matter becomes one
of scurrility and jest.  So the story of the poor hermit, perhaps the
best in the book, abruptly passes from a denunciation of the carnal
living of the Religious to a frank enjoyment of the favourite subject
of Elizabethan humour in which the laughter is all on the side of the
hermit.  Wilson is catholic in the extreme as regards his sources.
For 'moving sport by old tales' he recommends the stories of
King Arthur and the Round Table, 'the which,' in the opinion of his
friend Ascham, 'are nothing else than open manslaughter and bold
bawdrie.'  The bulk of his anecdotes, however, deal with the
ancients, and particularly with Diogenes and Cicero.  These he took
bodily from a contemporary collection -- <title>The Apophthegmes of Erasmus</title>
-- translated into English by his friend Nicholas Udall and first
published in the year 1542.  Udall designed his work to be for
'the most pleasant and the same most honeste, profitable and
holsome readyng of all maner men, and especially of nobel men',
and to this purpose Wilson borrowed the portions he used in
<title>The Arte of Rhetorique</title>.  There can be no doubt as to the identity
of the source; most of the classical stories can be traced to this
book.  Sometimes Wilson fills up his page by taking two together
as they follow one another in Udall's work, as for instance, the two
Cicero stories on p. 156, in the first of which he writes Vibius
Curius, where the original had Iubius Curtius, a fact which indicates
that his method was both hurried and unscrupulous.  But these
stories, carelessly chosen and thrown in by haphazard as they are,
point to the future supremacy of the lives of the Greeks and Romans
as moral teachers to the modern world.  Plutarch had not yet been

<pb n="xxv"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">Introduction.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">xxv</fw>

translated and students had to be content with the casual and
secondhand information they gleaned from Erasmus.  With the
coming of Amyot and North began that intelligent and anxious
study of the lives of the ancients from the most beautiful and
dignified account of them that the world possesses, which was to
have such momentous consequences in the next age, and was
destined to lead Europe a far cry from the path of social and
political advance which the sixteenth century trod.</p>

<p>The philologist will find little to interest him in this book;
unlike Mulcaster, Wilson touches not at all the study of language.
He does preserve a number of old and obsolete words -- 'snap&lt;!-&gt;share,'
'yngrame,' 'haultie,' 'nesh,' are a few -- but his instinct
was to distrust any word not in daily use, and he hated archaism as
much as he did the inkhorn term.  The student of style on the other
hand will find him an instructive example of a certain stage in the
development of English prose.  The intention is plain enough; he
desired to write as men spoke; to use no words and no constructions
not already familiar to all his readers.  Yet he utterly failed to
carry this out in practice.  There is a clumsiness and ineffectiveness
of syntax which makes the expression of any abstract idea impossible
or at best halting; it shows itself most prominently in his constant
use of participial nouns, particularly in his definitions.  Insinuation
is 'a priuie twining or close creeping in'; a conclusion is 'the
handsomely lapping vp together, and brief heaping of all that which
was said before, stirring the hearers by large vtteraunce, and plentiful
gathering of good matter, either the one way or the other'.  It is
easy enough to see that prose as an instrument of instruction or
a means of expressing ideas is in its infancy here.  The later
Elizabethans found that Latinism was a safer road than that which
Wilson and his fellows in their poverty trod, and the ideals of Cheke
had to wait for their acceptance and their success till the days of
Dryden.  Yet Wilson was not free from extravagances of a kind
incident to the practice of his art, and these are worth looking into
as a possible clue to the origin of the most popular type of English
prose in the generation which followed him.  The historians tell us



<pb n="xxvi"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">xxvi</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">Introduction.</fw>

that Euphuism is older than Euphues, but they have failed to notice
that the English study of rhetoric provides a much better indication
of its origin than do the imagined influences of Italy and Spain.
It is very easy to exaggerate the cosmopolitanism of literary effort;
and an English source for this affectation is in the nature of things
more likely than a foreign.  Now, the recipe, so to speak, of
Euphuism is to be found in <title>The Arte of Rhetorique</title>.  By this is not
meant that we claim that Wilson's book taught Lyly his secret;
only that it was through the fashionable study of rhetoric in the
literary coteries of the time that this manner of writing was evolved.
Examples of what is meant abound in this book.  One or two
characteristics may be noted here.  In the first place, one of the
most prominent features of Lyly's style was its adornment with
metaphors drawn from natural history of a legendary kind; this is
recommended by Wilson when he talks of the use of similitudes: --
'Oftentimes brute beasts and thinges which haue no life, minister
great matter in this behalf.  Therefore those that delite to prove
thinges by similitudes, must learn to knowe the nature of diuers
beastes, of metailles, of stones, and all such as haue any vertue in
them, and be applied to man's life.'  Passages such as the following
occur many times, and they all have the ring of Euphues about
them.  'For if felicitie should stand by length of time, some tree
were more happie than any man, for it liueth longer, and so likewise
brute beastes, as the Stagges, who liueth (as <name type="person">Plinie</name> doth say) two
hundred years and more.'  Here is both the natural history and the
ascription of the fact to the ancients, a favourite method with the
Euphuists.  But other characteristics are also to be found in these
pages.  The full-mouthed rhetoric of the later writer finds an
anticipatory echo, so to speak, in such a passage as this: -- 'For if they
that walke much in the sunne, and thinke not of it, are yet for the
most part sunne burnt, it can not but be that they which wittingly
and willingly trauail to counterfect other, must needes take some
colour of them and be like unto them in some one thing or other,
according to the prouerbe, by companying with the wise, a man shal
learn wisdome:' or in a translation such as that which Wilson

<fw place="top-left" type="head">Introduction.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">xxvii</fw>

gives on p. 186, of Tully's invective against Verres, a passage which
shows that a large part of the Euphuistic manner was derived from
the imitation of Cicero practised by the teachers and students of
rhetoric in the schools.  The connexion of Wilson with the<reg orig="Litera-ture">Literature</reg>
of the reign of Elizabeth must now (as he would say) be set
forth more at large.</p>
	</div2>
<div2 n="3" type="frontsubsection"><head>III</head>

<p>We talk too loosely when we extend the patronage of Elizabeth
forward and backward outside the limits of her actual reign.
Though Wilson served the queen faithfully as an ambassador and
counsellor for twenty most eventful years of peril and stress, he<reg orig="can-not">cannot</reg>
with any justice be termed an Elizabethan.  The word fits best the
high sense of glory and achievement which sprang upon the nation
after the destruction of Spain and lasted till the inexplicable apparition
of unsought melancholy which saddened the reign of James.  Wilson
died while the issue of the fight was still undecided; in truth he
belongs to an elder and graver age.  His companions were no
splendid courtiers nor daring and hardy adventurers; still less were
they swashbucklers, exquisites or literary dandies.  He was one of a
band of grave and dignified scholars, men preoccupied with morality
and citizenship as well as with the lighter problems of learning and
style.  They fought for sound education, for good classical<reg orig="scholar-ship">scholarship</reg>,
for the purity of written English, and behind all these for the
strength and worth of the native English character which they felt
was menaced by the reckless orgy of assimilation which seized young
England face to face with the allurements which reached it from
abroad.  It was not difficult to discern from which quarter the
danger came.  Its eminence as the fount and origin of the revived
learning had led English scholars to Italy early in the sixteenth
century, and the path was worn hard with the steady stream of their
feet for over a hundred years after.  This could not be without its
influence on the manners of the nation, and indeed the fears of the

<pb n="xxviii"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">xxviii</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">Introduction.</fw>

prophets of evil did not prove groundless.  There followed in the
train of the men of learning the men of fashion, eager to con and
copy the new manners of a society whose moral teacher was
Machiavelli, whose patterns of splendour were the courts of Florence
and Ferrara.  The effect on England was not long in showing itself,
and it lasted for more than two generations.  Coryat, writing well
within the seventeenth century, is as enthusiastic as the authors who
began the imitation of Italian metres, in Tottel's <title>Miscellany</title>; the rod
of censure is wielded as sternly in the satires of Donne and Hall as
it had been by Ascham fifty years before.  The danger feared was
a real one no doubt, yet the evil was not unmixed with good, for
insularity will always be a foe to good literature.  The Elizabethans
learned much more than their plots from their Italian models.
Improvements in dress, in the comforts of life and in the amenities
of society all came this way, nor were the worst effects dreaded by
the patriots ever planted on our shores.  Italian vice stopped short
of real life; poisoning and hired ruffianism flourished in the theatre
merely.  All this, however, is later than our author's period.  He and
his companions only foresaw the danger ahead; they laboured to
meet it as it came.  The brunt of the contest was borne by Ascham;
in the <title>Scholemaster</title> (the passage is too trite to make quotation
possible) he inveighs against the translation of Italian books and the
corrupt manners in living and the false judgement in doctrine which
they breed.  Wilson, perhaps because he knew his Italy better,
perhaps with some memory of the service done him by the citizens
of Rome in his time of peril, is much less outspoken than his fellows.
The Italianate Englishman, instead of being specially singled out for
damnation, finds himself classed with all who have come out of
foreign parts.  'Some farre iourneyed gentleman at their returne
home, like as they loue to goe in forraine apparell, so wil thei
ponder their talke with ouersea language.  He that commeth lately
out of Fraunce, will talke Frensh English and neuer blush at the
matter.  An other chops in with English Italienated, and applieth
the Italian phrase to our English speaking, the which is, as if an
Oratour that professeth to vtter his mind in plaine Latine, would

<fw place="top-left" type="head">Introduction.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">xxix</fw>

needes speake Poetrie, and farre fetched colours of straunge antiquitie.'
It is plainly only the man of letters who speaks here.</p>

<p>But if he was a laggard in the matter of the Italianate<reg orig="English-man">Englishman</reg>,
in the battle of style and language he fought in the van.  In
estimating the influence of his book it must be observed that<reg orig="what-ever">whatever</reg>
he and his party achieved of practical result was probably due
to his efforts.  <title>The Arte of Rhetorique</title> not only treated the matter
much more systematically, but it reached a much wider public than
Cheke or Haddon or Ascham commanded.  The attack was<reg orig="de-livered">delivered</reg>
at three points.  It was directed against undue Latinism,
against archaism, and against affectations borrowed from foreign
tongues.  The last need not detain us; his attitude towards it
has already been noticed.  But the question of 'inkhorn terms'
requires larger treatment.  The word seems to have been first used
about the year 1543, and it speedily became popular as a nickname
for this vice in writing.  The leader of this movement against
Latinism was Sir John Cheke, and his attitude need cause no surprise.
That the leading scholar of his day should be the chief opponent
of the triumph of the classics as a source of English vocabulary is
no more inexplicable a paradox than that which is presented by
the literary history of a century and a half later when Bentley
championed the cause of modern literature in the battle of the
books.  Both fought against men of far less scholarship than<reg orig="them-selves">themselves</reg>,
and Cheke, at any rate, knew and loved his own literature
and had its welfare deeply at heart.  In the introductory letter to
Thomas Hoby, which he wrote as preface to the latter's translation of
Castiglione's <title>Courtier</title>, he gives a plain statement of his case.  'I am
of this opinion that our own tung shold be written cleane and pure,
vnmixt and vnmangeled with borowing of other tunges, wherein
if we take not heed by tijm, ever borowing and neuer payeng,
she shal be fain to kep her house as bankrupt.  For then doth our
tung naturallie and praisable vtter her meaning, when she boroweth
no counterfeitness of other tunges to attire herself withall, but
vseth plainlie her owne, with such shift, as nature, craft, experiens
and folowing of other excellent doth lead her vnto, and if she want

<pb n="xxx"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">xxx</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">Introduction.</fw>

by any tijm (as being imperfight she must) yet let her borow with
suche bashfulness, that it mai appear, that if either the mould of our
own tung could serve us to fascion a woord of our own, or if the old
denisoned words could content and ease this neede, we wold not
boldly venture of vnknown wordes.'</p>

<p>Wilson entered on the campaign with vigour.  'I know them
that thinke Rhetorique standeth wholie vpon darke wordes, and
hee that can catch an inkhorne terme by the taile, him they coumpt
to be a fine Englisheman, and a good Rhetorician.'  He inveighs
against the unlearned or foolish fantasticall, 'soch fellowes as haue
seen learned men in their daies,' who so Latin their tongue that the
simple think they speake by some revelation, and he gives as an
example his famous letter 'deuised by a Lincolnshire man, for
a voyde benefice'. -- 'Such a letter that William Sommer himselfe,
could not make a better for that purpose.'  In his translation
of Demosthenes ten years later, he returns to the subject.  'I had
rather follow his veyne (he is speaking of Demosthenes) the which
was to speake simply and plainly to the common people's<reg orig="vnder-standing">vnderstanding</reg>,
than to overflouryshe with superfluous speach, although
I might thereby be counted equall with the best that euer wrate
Englysh.'  His model in writing was such a style as Latimer's, that
is to say, the pure speech of the common people.  He was too wise
not to see that the avoidance of classicisms might be pushed to
extremes.  'Now whereas wordes be receiued as well from Greeke
as Latine, to set forth our meaning in the English tongue, either for
lack of store, or els because we would enrich the language; it
is well doen to use them, and no man therein can be charged
for any affectation, when all other are agreed to followe the same
waie.  There is no man agreeued when he heareth (Letters Patents)
and yet patent is Latine, and signifieth open to all men.'  There
can be no doubt as to the sanity and justice of his attitude and
doubtless many good Saxon words were saved in the crusade which
would otherwise have been lost, for their nature makes them
difficult to recover if once they fall out of use.  But there were not
wanting strong opponents to Wilson and Cheke.  George Pettie,

<pb n="xxxi"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">Introduction.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">xxxi</fw>

one of a number of writers who made their bread out of the detested
style of composition, boldly championed the cause of Latinism
and ornament.  'It is not unknown to all men,' he says, 'how
many words we have fetcht from hence within these few yeeres,
whiche if they should all be counted inkpot tearmes, I know not how
we shall speake anie thing without blacking our mouthes with inke.'
There is reason in the criticism; Cheke and his followers did go too
far, while safety, in this case as in most, lay in the mean.  Yet their
efforts were not without fruit, for the worst excesses never took a
strong grip of English prose; that it was saved is not so much due
to their precepts as critics as to their work as translators.</p>

<p>The shafts which Wilson directs against archaism are no less keen
though their effect was less.  He puts his arguments into the mouth
of an ancient philosopher.</p>

<p><quote><name type="person">Phauorinus</name> the Philosopher (as <name type="person">Gellius</name> telleth the tale) did hit
a yong man ouer the Thumbes very handsomely, for vsing ouer
old, and ouer straunge wordes.  Sirha (quoth he) when our olde
great auncesters and Graundsires were aliue, they spake plainly in
their mothers tongue, and vsed olde language, such as was spoken
then at the building of Roome.  But you talke me such a Latine, as
though you spake with them euen now, that were two or three
thousand yeres agoe, and onely because you would haue no man to
vnderstand what you say.  Now, were it not better for thee
a thousande fold, (thou foolish fellowe) in seeking to haue thy
desire, to holde thy peace, and speake nothing at all?  For then
by that meanes, fewe should knowe what were thy meaning.  But
thou saiest, the olde antiquitie doth like thee best, because it is
good, sober, and modest.  Ah, liue man, as they did before thee,
and speake thy mind as men doe at this day.</quote></p>

<p>Now, the return to Chaucer is by far the most striking feature of the
revival of English letters.  We are accustomed to hear from the
historians of the introduction and imitation of Italian metres by the
authors of Tottel's <title>Miscellany</title>, but in reality their indebtedness to
the older English poets is far more obvious and much better worth
noting.  It is not merely the direct references to Chaucer nor the
acknowledged quotations from his work.  The whole spirit of the
verse both of Surrey and Wyatt is caught from him.  The opening

<pb n="xxxii"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">xxxii</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">Introduction.</fw>

lines of the first poem in the volume, written by Surrey, are pure
Chaucer: --
</p>
<lg>
        <l>The sonne hath twise brought furth his tender grene,
        </l><l>And clad the earth in lustie loueliness.</l>
</lg>

<p>In the second we get the 'soote season' and all the Chaucerian
language of spring.  Wyatt is no less firm in his allegiance.  There
is no mistaking the source of the rhythm of such a passage as
this: --
</p>
<lg>
        <l>He knoweth, how grete Atride that made Troy freat,
        </l><l>And Hanniball, to Rome so troubelous:
        </l><l>Whom Homer honored, Achilles that great,
        </l><l>And Thaffricane Scipion the famous:
        </l><l>And many other, by much nurture glorious:
        </l><l>Whose fame and honor did bring them aboue:
        </l><l>I did let fall in base dishonest loue.</l>
</lg>

<p>The minor authors who contributed to the collection fell also under
the spell.
</p>
<lg>
        <l>Full faire and white she is and White by name:</l>
</lg>

<p>There is no need to multiply instances.  As Wilson scornfully says,
'The fine courtier wil talke nothing but Chaucer,' and the fine
courtier was to be the saving of English verse.  Wilson and his
companions, in attacking Latinisms and language borrowed from the
older poets, were attacking the two most precious sources of the
Elizabethan poets' vocabulary.  All the sonorousness, dignity, and
beauty of Spenser and the dramatists would have been lost had they
succeeded in their object, and English poetry would have been
starved into the warped and ugly forms of Sternhold and Tusser.
We cannot, then, regret that their efforts failed, as they did.  For
all their learning and high morality, they were not fit teachers;
their moral preoccupations made it impossible that they should be
so.  Their ideal reappeared and was fulfilled late in the seventeenth
century when fantasy and imagery had worn themselves out and the
greater richness of the language made simplicity possible and
adequate for poetic speech.

</p>
<p>There remains a matter of special interest.  From time to time
there have been critics who suggested that traces of the reading of
<title>The Arte of Rhetorique</title> might be found in Shakespeare.  Nathan
Drake, a student of Shakespeare whose wide knowledge of minor
Elizabethan literature should have saved him from the neglect into
which he has fallen, suggested that the character of Dogberry might
be derived from Wilson.  'An other good fellowe of the countrey
being an Officer and Maior of a toune, and desirous to speake like
a fine learned man, hauing just occasion to rebuke a runnegate
fellowe, said after this wise in a great heate.  Thou yngrame an
vacation knaue, if I take thee anymore within the circumcision of
my dampnation: I will so corrupt thee, that all other vacation knaues
shall take illsample by thee.'  There is sufficient similarity to warrant
the suggestion, but much more certain evidence of Shakespeare's
reading of Wilson is to be found; it lies, as might be expected, in
<title>Love's Labour's Lost</title>.  There can be no doubt from this play that
Shakespeare had read some Rhetoric, that he found it tedious and
dull and fit matter only for ridicule and laughter.  It is the formal
rhetoric which he satirizes; its schemes and its technical terms.
'I will look again on the intellect of the letter,' says Holofernes,
'for the nomination of the party writing to the person written
unto.'  The word here is Wilson's Intellection, which is 'a trope,
when we gather or iudge the whole by the part, or part by the whole'.
But Holofernes was not the only student of <title>The Arte of Rhetorique</title> in
the company gathered in Navarre.  Don Armado culled some of
the splendour of his speech from this source.  His letter to Jaquenetta
is modelled on one of Wilson's examples.  He is writing of King
Cophetua: --

<cit><quote>He it was that might rightly say Veni, vidi, vici; which to
annothanize in the vulgar, -- O base and obscure vulgar! -- videlicet,
He came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw, two; overcame,
three.  Who came? the king: why did he come? to see: why did
he see? to overcome: to whom came he? to the beggar: what
saw he? the beggar: who overcame he? the beggar.  The
conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.  The captive is
enriched: on whose side? the beggar's.  The catastrophe is a nuptial:
on whose side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in both.
I am the king; for so stands the comparison: thou the beggar: for
so witnesseth thy lowliness.</quote><bibl n="shak. lll 4.1.67">(LLL 4.1.67)</bibl></cit></p>

<pb n="xxxiv"/>

<fw place="top-right" type="head">Introduction.</fw>

</p>
<p>All this follows the questions appended to the Example of<reg orig="com-mending">commending</reg>
King David given below p. 21.  It is quite possible that
other evidence of Shakespeare's acquaintance with Wilson's work
might yet be found; a certain knowledge of it can be proved beyond
doubt.<note place="foot" anchored="yes" n="1"> The reference to Timon on p. 55 has been thought to have suggested <title><bibl n="shak. tim">Timon
of Athens</bibl></title>.  It is possible that the panegyric of order on p. 157 may have<reg orig="sug-gested">suggested</reg>
the speech of Ulysses in <title>Troilus and Cressida</title>, Act. I. Sc. iii.  There is little
similarity between the two, save in idea, but the passage in Shakespeare looks as
though it were based on a particular reminiscence of his reading.  Professor
Raleigh has pointed out (<title>Shakespeare</title>, E. M. L.) the similarity of some of Wilson's
speeches to those of Falstaff.</note></p>

<p>That sort of criticism which consists in the resurrection of dead
reputation, or in the re-erection of broken monuments, is not apt to be
the most sound.  It is not pretended here that <title>The Arte of Rhetorique</title>
is a great book.  But that it has an historical interest apart from, and
independent of, its real merits has perhaps been shown in these pages.
No treatise on Rhetoric can ever be anything more than a kind of
tool-box with whose contents the novice may try his hand, and in
a case of this sort there is neither best nor worst.  If he has talent
and imagination he will use his tools well, however poor they be; if
not, he will be a botcher at the best, even if they are good.  The
words of Theseus may be applied with greater truth in this matter than
in that of which he used them: 'The best of this kind are but
shadows; and the worst are no worse if imagination mend them.'</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge the help and suggestions of Professor
Raleigh, and of Professor Grierson of Aberdeen University, and the

<p>GREAT may
their boldnesse bee thought, that seeke
without feare to sett foorth their knowledge: &amp; suffer
their doinges to be sene, they care not of whom.  For, not
onely thereby doe they bring men to thinke, that they stand
much in their owne conceipt, but also they seeme to assure
themselues, that all men will like whatsoeuer they write.
Wherein they commit two great faults: the one is, that they
are proud: the other is, that they are fond.  For, what
greater pride can there be, then for any man to thinke<reg orig="him-selfe">himselfe</reg>
to be wiser, then all men liuing?  Or what greater folly
can be immagined, then for one to thinke, that all men will
like, whatsoeuer he writeth?  Such are they for the most
part by all likelihood, that doe set forth Bookes.  Wherein
they doe both betray them selues, and also giue great occasion
to the world, to talke largely of them.  But al those that doe
write, are not such as I say, nor meane not as I thinke, as the
which are wise and learned men, writing onely vnder the
correction of others, to edifie their neighbour, and not seeking
in any wise their own glorie.  Neither all that bee Readers
will talke their pleasures, but rather stay their iudgements,
and weye things with reason.  Some perhappes may like the
writer, if his doinges bee good, but the most part vndoubtedly
must of force bee offended, as the which are corrupt of<reg orig="iudge-ment">iudgement</reg>,
because they are nought.  Then such as seeke the
greatest praise for writing of Bookes, should do best in my
simple minde to write foolish toyes, for then the most part
would best esteeme them.  And herein perhappes may I get
some aduauntage, that in my yong yeares, haue bene bold to
set forth my simple fantasies.  For, in follie, I dare compare

</p>
<p><name type="person">Cicero</name> in his second Booke <title>de
Oratore</title>, bringeth in one <name type="person">Lucilius</name>, a
pleasaunt and merie conceipted man, who saith, that he would not haue
such thinges as he wrote to bee read, either of those that were
excellently learned, or of them that were altogether ignoraunt.  For,
that the one would thinke more of his doinges, and haue a farther
meaning with him, than euer the aucthour selfe thought: the other
taking the booke in his hand, would vnderstand nothing at all, being
as meete to reade Aucthours, as an Asse to play on the Organnes.  This
man in thus saying, had some reason.  But I being somewhat acquainted
with the world, haue found out an other sort of men, whom of all
others, I would bee loth should reade any of my doinges: especially
such things as either touched Christ, or any good doctrine.  And those
are such malicious folke, that loue to finde faults in other mens
matters, and seuen yeares together wil keepe them in store, to the
vtter vndoing of their Christian brother: not minding to reade for
their better learning, but seeking to depraue whatsoeuer they finde,
and watching their time, will take best aduauntage to vndoe their
neighbour.  Such men I say of all others, would I be loth to haue the
sight, of any myne earnest doinges, if I could tell how to forbid
them, or how to hinder them of their purpose.</p>

<p>Two yeares past at my beeing in <name type="place">Italie</name>, I was charged in
<name type="place">Roome</name> Towne, to my great daunger and vtter vndoing (if
Gods goodnesse had not bin the greater) to haue written this
Booke of <title>Rhetorique</title>, &amp; the  <title>Logicke</title> also, for the which I was
coumpted an Hereticke, notwithstanding the absolution,
graunted to al the Realme, by <name type="person">Pope Iulie</name> the third, for al<reg orig="for-mer">former</reg>
offences or practises, deuised against the holie mother
Church, as they call it.  A straunge matter, that thinges done
in England seuen yeres before, and the same vniuersally<reg orig="for-giuen">forgiuen</reg>,
should afterwards be layd to a mans charge in <name type="place">Roome</name>.
But what cannot malice doe?  Or what will not the wilfull
deuise, to satisfie their mindes, for vndoing of others?  God
be my Iudge, I had then as little feare (although death was
present, and the torment at hand, wherof I felt some smart)
as euer I had in all my life before.  For, when I saw those that
did seeke my death, to bee so maliciously set, to make such
poore shifts for my readier dispatch, and to burden me with

<fw place="top" type="head">A Prologue to the Reader.</fw>

those backe reckeninges: I tooke such courage, and was so
bolde, that the Iudges then did much maruaile at my stoutnesse,
and thinking to bring doune my great heart, told me plainly,
that I was in farther perill, then wherof I was aware, and
sought therupon to take aduauntage of my words, and to
bring me in daunger by all meanes possible.  And after long
debating with me, they willed me at any hand to submit
my selfe to the holy Father, and the deuout Colledge of
Cardinalles.  For otherwise there was no remedie.  With
that beeing fully purposed, not to yeeld to any submission,
as one that little trusted their colourable deceipt: I was as
ware as I could bee, not to vtter any thing for mine owne
harme, for feare I shoulde come in their daunger.  For
then either should I haue dyed, or els haue denyed both openly
and shamefully, the knowne trueth of Christ and his Gospell.
In the ende by Gods grace, I was wonderfully deliuered, through
plain force of the worthie <name>Romaines</name> (an enterprise heretofore
in that sort neuer attempted) being then without hope of life,
and much lesse of libertie.  And now that I am come home,
this booke is shewed me, and I desired to looke vpon it,
to amend it where I thought meet.  Amend it, quoth I?
Nay, let the booke first amende it selfe, and make mee
amendes.  For surely I haue no cause to acknowledge it
for my booke, because I haue so smarted for it.  For where I
haue beene euill handled, I haue much a doe to shewe my self
friendly.  If the Sonne were the occasion of the Fathers
imprisonment, would not the Father bee offended with
him thinke you?  Or at the least, would he not take heede how
hereafter he had to doe with him?  If others neuer get more
by bookes then I haue done: it were better be a Carter, then
a Scholer, for [worldly] profite.  A burnt child feareth the
fire, and a beaten dogge escheweth the whippe.  Now<reg orig="there-fore">therefore</reg>,
I will none of this booke from henceforth, I will none of
him I say: take him that list, and weare him that will.  And
by that time they haue paid for him so dearely as I haue done,
they will bee as wearie of him as I haue beene.  Who that
toucheth Pitch shall be filed with it, and he that goeth in the
Sunne shall bee Sunne burnt, although he thinke not of it.
So they that wil reade this or such like bookes, shall in the
ende be as the bookes are.  What goodnesse is in this treatise,

<fw place="top" type="head">A.v.</fw>

<fw place="top" type="head">A Prologue to the Reader.</fw>

I cannot without vainglorie report, neither will I meddle with
it, either hot or colde.  As it was, so it is, and so bee it still
hereafter for mee: so that I heare no more of it, and that it
be not yet once again cast in my dish.  But this I say to
others, as I am assured they will laugh that will reade it: So
if the world should turne (as God forbid) they were most like
to weepe, that in all pointes would followe it.  I would bee
loth that any man should hurt himselfe for my doinges.  And
therefore to auoyde the worst for all parts, the best were neuer
once to looke on it: for then I am assured no man shal take
harme by it.  But I thinke some shal reade it, before whom
I doe wash my handes, if any harme should come to them
hereafter, &amp; let them not say but that they are warned.
I neuer heard a man yet troubled for ignoraunce in Religion.
And yet me thinkes it is as great an heresie not to know God,
as to erre in the knowledge of God.  But some perhaps may
say vnto me: Sir, you are much to be blamed that are so<reg orig="fear-full">fearfull</reg>,
and doe cast such perrilles before hande, to discourage
men from well doing.  I aunswere: My minde is not to
discourage any man, but only to shewe how I haue beene tried
for this bookes sake, <foreign lang="la">tanquam per ignem</foreign>.  For in deede the
Prison was on fire when I came out of it, and where as
I feared fire most (as who is he that doth not feare it?) I was
deliuered by fire and sworde together.  And yet now thus
fearfull am I, that hauing beene thus swinged, and restrained
of libertie: I would first rather hassard my life presently<reg orig="here-after">hereafter</reg>
to dye vpon a Turke: then to abide againe without hope
of libertie, such painfull imprisonment for euer.  So that
I haue now got courage with suffering damage, and my selfe
as you see, very willing from henceforth to dye: being then
brought only but in feare of death.  They that loue sorrowe
vpon sorrowe: God send it them.  I for my part had rather
bee without sence of griefe, then for euer to liue in griefe.
And I thinke the troubles before death being long suffered,
and without hope continued are worse a great deale, then
present death it selfe can bee: Especially to him that maketh
litle accompt of this life, and is wel armed with a constant
mind to Godward.  Thus I haue talked of my self more then
I needed, some will say, and yet not more (may I well say)
then I haue needed in deede.  For I was without all helpe,

<fw place="top" type="head">A Prologue to the Reader.</fw>

and without all hope, not onely of libertie, but also of life,
and therefore what thing needed I not?  Or with what wordes
sufficiently could I set forth my neede?  God be praised,
and thankes be giuen to him onely, that not onely deliuered
me out of the Lyons mouth, but also hath brought England
my deare Countrey, out of great thraldome and forraine
bondage.</p>

<p>MAn (in whom is
powred the breath of life) was made at
the first being an euerliuing creature, vnto the likenesse
of God, endued with reason, and appointed Lorde ouer all
other thinges liuing.  But after the fall of our first Father,
sinne so crept in that our knowledge was much darkned,
and by corruption of this our flesh, mans reason and<reg orig="entende-ment">entendement</reg>
were both ouerwhelmed.  At what time God being
sore greeued with the follie of one man, pitied of his mere
goodnesse the whole state and posteritie of Mankind.  And
therefore (whereas through the wicked suggestion of our
ghostly enemie, the ioyfull fruition of Gods glorie was
altogether lost:) it pleased our heauenly Father to repaire
mankind of his free mercie, and to graunt an euerliuing
enheritaunce, vnto all such as would by constaunt faith seeke
earnestly hereafter.  Long it was ere that man knewe<reg orig="him-selfe">himselfe</reg>,
being destitute of Gods grace, so that all thinges waxed
sauage, the earth vntilled, societie neglected, Gods will not
knowne, man against man, one against an other, and all
against order.  Some liued by spoyle: some like brute beastes
grased vpon the ground: some went naked: some roomed
like Woodoses: none did any thing by reason, but most
did what they could by manhood.  None almost considered
the euerliuing GOD, but all liued most commonly after their
owne lust.  By death they thought that all thinges ended:
by life they looked for none other liuing.  None remembred
the true obseruation of Wedlocke: none tendered the<reg orig="edu-cation">education</reg>
of their children: Lawes were not regarded: true
dealing was not once vsed.  For vertue, vice bare place:
for right and equitie, might vsed authoritie.  And therefore,
whereas man through reason might haue vsed order: man
through folie fell into errour.  And thus for lacke of skill,
and for want of grace euill so preuailed, that the deuil was
most esteemed, and God either almost vnknowne among them
all, or els nothing feared among so many.  Therefore, euen

<fw place="top" type="head">The Preface.</fw>

now when man was thus past all hope of amendement, God
still tendering his owne workmanshippe, stirring vp his<reg orig="faith-full">faithfull</reg>
and elect, to perswade with reason all men to societie.
And gaue his appointed Ministers knowledge both to see the
natures of men, and also graunted them the gift of vtteraunce,
that they might with ease win folke at their will, and frame
them by reason to all good order.  And therefore, whereas
men liued brutishly in open feeldes, hauing neither house
to shroude them in, nor attire to clothe their backes, nor yet
any regard to seeke their best auaile: these appointed of
GOD called them together by vtteraunce of speech, and
perswaded with them what was good, what was bad, &amp; what
was gainful for mankind.  And although at first the rude
could hardly learne, and either for the straungenesse of the
thing, would not gladly receiue the offer, or els for lack
of knowledge, could not perceiue the goodnesse: yet being
somewhat drawne, and delited with the pleasantnesse of reason,
and the sweetnesse of vtteraunce: after a certaine space they
became through Nurture and good aduisement, of wilde,
sober: of cruell, gentle: of fooles, wise: and of beastes, men:
such force hath the tongue, and such is the power of Eloquence
and reason, that most men are forced euen to yeeld in that
which most standeth against their will.  And therefore the
Poets doe feine, that  <name type="person">Hercules</name> beeing a man of great<reg orig="wise-dome">wisedome</reg>,
had all men lincked together by the eares in a chaine,
to drawe them and leade them euen as he lusted.  For his
witte was so great, his tongue so eloquent, and his experience
such, that no one man was able to withstande his reason, but
euery one was rather driuen to doe that which he would, and
to will that which he did: agreeing to his aduise both in word
and worke in all that euer they were able.  Neither can I see
that men could haue beene brought by any other meanes,
to liue together in fellowship of life, to maintaine Cities, to
deale truely, and willingly obeye one an other, if men at the
first had not by art and eloquence, perswaded that which they
full oft found out by reason.  For what man I pray you,
beeing better able to maintaine himself by valiaunt courage,
then by liuing in base subiection, would not rather looke
to rule like a Lord, then to liue like an vnderling: if by
reason he were not perswaded, that it behoueth euery man

<fw place="top" type="head">The Preface.</fw>

to liue in his owne vocation: and not to seeke any higher
roume, then wherunto he was at the first appointed?  Who
would digge and delue from Morne till Euening?  Who
would trauaile and toyle with ye sweat of his browes?  Yea,
who would for his Kings pleasure aduenture and hassarde
his life, if witte had not so won men, that they thought
nothing more needfull in this world, nor any thing whereunto
they were more bounden: then here to liue in their duetie, and
to traine their whole life according to their calling. <reg orig="There-fore">Therefore</reg>,
whereas men are in many thinges weake by Nature, and
subiect to much infirmitie: I thinke in this one poinct they
passe all other creatures liuing, that haue the gift of speech
and reason.  And among all other, I thinke him most worthie
fame, and amongst all men to bee taken for halfe a GOD:
that therein doth chiefly and aboue all other excell men,
wherein men doe excell beastes.  For he that is among the
reasonable of al most reasonable, and among the wittie, of all
most wittie, and among the eloquent, of all most eloquent:
him thinke I among all men, not onely to be taken for a
singuler man, but rather to be coumpted for halfe a God.  For,
in seeking the excellencie hereof, the soner he draweth to
perfection, the nyer he commeth to God, who is the
cheefe wisedome, and therfore called God, because he is most
wise, or rather wisedome it self.</p>

<p><emph>RHetorique</emph> is an Arte to set foorth by vtteraunce of words,
matter at large, or (as <emph>Cicero</emph> doth say) it is a learned, or
rather an artificiall declaration of the mynd, in the handling of any
cause, called in contention, that may through reason largely be
discussed.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subsection" n="The matter whereupon an Oratour must speake."><head>The matter whereupon an Oratour must speake.</head>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Rhetorique occupied
about all lawes,
<reg orig="con-cerning">concerning</reg> man.</note>
<p>AN Orator must be able to speake fully of al those questions,
which by lawe &amp; mans ordinance are enacted, and 
appointed for the vse and profite of man, such as are thought 
apt for the tongue to set forwarde.  Nowe  <emph>Astronomie</emph> is 
rather learned by demonstration, then taught by any great 
vtterance.  <emph>Arithmetique</emph> smally needeth the vse of Eloquence, 
seeing it may be had wholy by nombring only.  <emph>Geometrie</emph>
rather asketh a good square, then a cleane flowing tongue to
set out the art.  Therefore an Orators profession, is to speake
only of all such matters, as may largely be expounded for
mans behoue, and may with much grace be set out, for all
men to heare them.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subsection" n="Of questions. "><head>Of questions. </head>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Questions of two sort.</note>
<p>EVery question or demaund in things, is of two sortes. 
Either it is an infinite question, &amp; without end, or els 
it is definite, and comprehended within some ende.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Questions infinite.</note>
Those questions are called infinite, which generally are 
propounded, without the comprehension of tyme, place, and 
persone, or any such like: that is to say, when no certaine
thing is named, but onely words are generally spoken.  As
thus, whether it be best to marrie, or to liue single.  Which
is better, a courtiers life, or a Scholers life.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Questions definite.</note>
Those questions are called definite, which set forth a matter, 
with the appointment and naming of place, time, and person. 
As thus.  Whether now it be best here in Englande, for a
Priest to Marrie, or to liue single.  Whether it were meete

<pb n="2"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">2</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

for the kings Maiestie that nowe is, to marrie with a stranger,
or to marrie with one of his owne Subiects.  Now the definite
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Questions definite, belong
properly to an Orator.</note>
question (as the which concerneth some one person) is most
agreeing to the purpose of an Orator, considering particuler
matters in the law, are euer debated betwixt certaine persons,
the one affirming for his parte, and the other denying as fast
againe for his parte.</p>

<p>Thinges generally spoken without all circumstaunces, are
more proper vnto the <emph>Logician</emph>, who talketh of thinges <reg orig="vni-uersally">vniuersally</reg>,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Questions infinite,
proper vnto
<reg orig="Logi-cians">Logicians</reg>.</note>
without respect of person, time, or place.  And yet
notwithstanding, <emph>Tullie</emph> doth say, that whosoeuer will talke of
particuler matter must remember, that within the same also
is comprehended a generall.  As for example.  If I shall aske
this question, whether it bee lawfull for William Conquerour
to inuade England, and win it by force of Armour, I must
also consider this, whether it bee lawfull for any man to
vsurpe power, or it bee not lawful.  That if the greater
cannot be borne withall, the lesse can not bee neither.  And
in this respect, a generall question agreeth well to an Orators
profession, and ought well to bee knowne for the better
furtheraunce of his matter, notwithstanding the particuler
question is euer called in controuersie, and the generall only
thereupon considered, to comprehend and compasse the same,
as the which is more generall.</p>

<div3 type="para"><head>The ende of Rhetorique.</head>

<p>Three thinges are required of an Orator.
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Orators bound

<item n="3">And to perswade.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>FIrst therefore, an Orator must labour to tell his tale,
that the hearers may well knowe what he meaneth, and
vnderstand him wholy, the which he shall with ease vse, if he
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Plaine words

vtter his minde in plaine words, such as are vsually receiued,
and tell it orderly, without going about the bush.  That if he
doe not this, he shall neuer doe the other.  For what man
can be delited, or yet be perswaded with the only hearing of
those thinges, which he knoweth not what they meane.  The
tongue is ordeined to expresse the minde, that one may
vnderstand an others meaning: now what auaileth to speake,
when none can tell what the speaker meaneth?  Therefore

<emph>Phauorinus</emph> the Philosopher (as <emph>Gellius</emph> telleth the tale) did hit
a yong man ouer the Thumbes very handsomely, for vsing ouer
old, and ouer straunge wordes.  Sirha (quoth he) when our olde
great auncesters and Graundsires were aliue, they spake
plainly in their mothers tongue, and vsed olde language, such
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">A <reg orig="Philo-sophers">Philosophers</reg>
wittie saying to a
yong man that
sought to speake
dark <reg orig="lan-guage.">language.</reg></note>
as was spoken then at the building of Roome.  But you talke
me such a Latine, as though you spake with them euen now,
that were two or three thousand yeres agoe, and onely
because you would haue no man to vnderstand what you say.
Now, were it not better for thee a thousande fold, (thou foolish
fellowe) in seeking to haue thy desire, to holde thy peace, and
speake nothing at all?  For then by that meanes, fewe should
knowe what were thy meaning.  But thou saiest, the olde
antiquitie doth like thee best, because it is good, sober, and
modest.  Ah, liue man, as they did before thee, and speake
thy mind now as men doe at this day.  And remember that
which <emph>C&aelig;sar</emph> saieth, beware as long as thou liuest of straunge
wordes, as thou wouldest take heede and eschue great Rockes
in the Sea.</p>

<p>The next part that he hath to play, is to chere his geastes,
and to make them take pleasure, with hearing of thinges
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Orators must vse delitefull
wordes and sayinges.</note>
wittely deuised, and pleasauntly set foorth.  Therefore euery
Orator should earnestly labour to file his tongue, that his
words may slide with ease, and that in his deliueraunce he
may have such grace, as the sound of a Lute, or any such
Instrument doth giue.  Then his sentences must be wel
framed, and his words aptly vsed, through the whole discourse
of his Oration.</p>

<p>Thirdly, such quicknesse of witte must bee shewed, and such
pleasaunt sawes so well applied, that the eares may finde
much delite, whereof I will speake largely, when I shall
intreate of mouing laughter.  And assuredly nothing is more
needfull, then to quicken these heauie loden wittes of ours,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Preachers not so <reg orig="dili-gently">diligently</reg>
heard as common Players.</note>

and much to cherish these our lompish and vnweldie Natures,
for except men finde delite, they will not long abide: delite
them, and winne them: wearie them, and you lose them for
euer.  And that is the reason, that men commonly tarie the
ende of a merie Play, and cannot abide the halfe hearing of
a sower checking Sermon.  Therefore euen these auncient
Preachers, must now and then play the fooles in the pulpit, to

serue the tickle eares of their fleting audience, or els they are

refreshing, long abide to heare any one thing.  Thus we see,
that to delite is needfull, without the which weightie matters
will not be heard at all, and therefore him cunne I thanke,
that both can and will ever, mingle sweete among the sower,
be he Preacher, Lawyer, yea, or Cooke either hardly, when
hee dresseth a good dish of meate: now I need not to tell
that scurrilitie, or ale-house iesting, would bee thought odious,
or grosse mirth would be deemed madnesse: considering that
euen the meane witted do knowe that alreadie, and as for
other that haue no wit, they will neuer learne it, therfore
God speede them.  Now when these two are done, hee must
perswade, and moue the affections of his hearers in such wise,
that they shalbe forced to yeeld vnto his saying, whereof

any thing thereof at this tyme.</p></div3></div2>

<p>FIrst needfull it is that hee, which desireth to excell in this
gift of Oratorie, and longeth to proue an eloquent man,
must naturally haue a wit, and an aptnesse thereunto: then
must he to his Booke, and learne to bee well stored with
knowledge, that he may be able to minister matter for al
causes necessarie.  The which when he hath got plentifully,
he must vse much exercise, both in writing, and also in
speaking.  For though hee haue a wit and learning together,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Practise maketh
al things perfect.</note>
yet shall they both little auaile without much practise.  What
maketh the Lawyer to haue such utteraunce?  Practise.  What
maketh the Preacher to speake so roundly?  Practise.  Yea,
what maketh women goe so fast awaye with their wordes?
Mary practise I warrant you.  Therefore in all faculties,
diligent practise, and earnest exercise, are the onely things
that make men proue excellent.  Many men know the art very
well, and be in all points throughly grounded and acquainted
with the precepts, &amp; yet it is not their hap to proue eloquent.
And the reason is, that eloquence it selfe, came not vp first



<pb n="5"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">5</fw>

by the art, but the arte rather was gathered vpon eloquence.
For wisemen seeing by much obseruation and diligent practise,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Rhetorique first made by wise
men, and not <reg orig="wise-men">wisemen</reg>
first made by Rhetorique.</note>

the compasse of diuers causes, compiled thereupon precepts
and lessons, worthy to be knowne and learned of all men.
Therefore before arte was inuented, eloquence was vsed, and
through practise made perfect, the which in all things is
a soueraigne meane, most highly to excell.</p>

<p>Now, before we vse either to write, or speake eloquently,
wee must dedicate our myndes wholy, to followe the most
wise and learned men, and seeke to fashion as wel their

speache and gesturing, as their witte or endyting.  The which
when we earnestly mynd to doe, we can not but in time
appere somewhat like them.  For if they that walke much
in the Sunne, and thinke not of it, are yet for the most part
Sunne burnt, it can not be but that they which wittingly
and willingly trauayle to counterfect other, must needes take
some colour of them, and be like vnto them in some one
thing or other, according to the Prouerbe, by companying

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Oratours must have v. things

<p>THe finding out of apt matter, called otherwise Inuention,
is a searching out of things true, or things likely, the
which may reasonablie set forth a matter, and make it appeare
probable.  The places of <emph>Logique</emph>, giue good occasion to finde
out plentifull matter.  And therefore, they that will proue any
cause, and seeke onely to teach thereby the trueth, must search
out the places of <emph>Logique</emph>, and no doubt they shall finde much
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Inuention, what it is.
Disposition, what it is.</note>
plentie.  But what auaileth much treasure and apt matter, if
man can not apply it to his purpose.  Therefore, in the second
place is mentioned, the setling or ordering of things inuented
for this purpose, called in Latine <emph>Dispositio</emph>, the which is
nothing els but an apt bestowing, and orderly placing of
things, declaring where euery argument shall be set, and in
what maner euery reason shalbe applied for confirmation of the
purpose.</p>

<p>But yet what helpeth it though wee can finde good reasons,
and knowe how to place them, if wee haue not apt words and
picked Sentences, to commende the whole matter.  Therefore,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Elocution, what it is.
Memorie, what it is.</note>
this point must needes followe to beautifie the cause, the which
being called Elocution, is an applying of apt wordes and
sentences to the matter, found out to confirme the cause.
When all these are had together it auaileth little, if man haue
no Memorie to containe them.  The Memorie therefore must
be cherished, the which is a fast holding both of matter and
words couched together, to confirme any cause.</p>

<p>Be it now that one haue all these fower, yet if he want the
fift all the other doe little profite.  For though a man can
finde out good matter and good wordes, though hee can

<p>Thus we see, that euery one of these must goe together, to

witnesses, or with wordes, then bee able to confute his with

vnto that which I haue to say, being of it selfe so iust and so
reasonable, that none can rightly speake against it, &amp; shew them
that great pitie it were, for lacke of the onely hearing, that
a true matter should want true dealing.  Ouer &amp; besides al
these, there remaine two lessons, the which wisemen haue
alwaies obserued, and therefore ought of all men assuredly to
bee learned.  The one is, that if any matter be laied against

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Matters hard to auoyde
should alwaies be past
ouer, as though wee sawe
them not at all.
Good to be bold in most
daunger, if otherwise
we cannot escape.</note>
vs, which by reason can hardly be auoyded, or the which is
so open, that none almost can deny: it were wisedome in
confuting all the other reasons, to passe ouer this one, as
though we saw it not, and therefore speake neuer a word of
it.  Or els if necessitie shall force a man to say somewhat, he
may make an outward bragge, as though there were no matter
in it, euer so speaking of it, as though he would stand to
the triall, making men to beleeue he would fight in the
cause, when better it were (if necessitie so required) to run
cleane awaie.  And therein though a man do flie and giue
place, euermore the gladder the lesse rauing there is, or
stirring in this matter: yet he flieth wisely and for this ende,
that being sensed otherwise, and strongly appointed, hee may
take his aduersarie at the best aduauntage, or at the least
wearie him with much lingering, and make him with oft such
flying, to forsake his cheefe defence.</p>

<p>The other lesson is, that whereas we purpose alwaies to
haue the victorie, we should so speake that we may labour,
rather not to hinder or hurt our cause, then to seeke meanes

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Better not to hurte

Warenesse in speaking,
and <reg orig="for-bearing to speake[.]">forbearing to speake[.]</reg></note>

to further it.  And yet I speake not this, but that both these
are right necessary, and euery one that will doe good, must
take paines in them both, but yet notwithstanding, it is a
fouler fault a great deale for an Orator, to be found hurting
his owne cause, then it should turne to his rebuke, if he had
not furthered his whole entent.  Therfore not onely is it <reg orig="wise-dome">wisedome</reg>,
to speake so much as is needefull, but also it is good
reason to leaue vnspoken so much as is needelesse, the which
although the wisest can doe and neede no teaching, yet these
common wittes offende now and then in this behalf.  Some
man being stirred, shall hurt more our cause then twentie

other.  Taunting woordes before some men, will not bee
borne at all.  Sharpe rebuking of our aduersarie, or frumpes
giuen before some persons, can not be suffered at all.  Yea,
sometymes a man must not speake all that he knoweth, for if
he do, he is like to find small fauour, although he haue iust
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">The <reg orig="per-sone before">persone before</reg>
whom we speake must be

Time must be

cause to speake, and may with reason declare his mynd at
large.  And albeit that witlesse folke, can sooner rebuke that
which is fondly spoken, then redily praise that which is wisely
kept close, yet the necessitie of the matter must rather be
marked, then the fond iudgement of the people esteemed.
What a sore saying were this: When a Lawier should take
in hande a matter concerning life and death: and an other
should aske how he hath sped, to heare tell that the Lawyer
hath not only cast away his client, but vndoen himself also, in
speaking thinges, inconsideratly, as no doubt it often happeneth
that wisemen and those also that be none euill men neither,
may vnwares speake things, which afterward they sore repent,
and would call backe againe with losse of a great somme.
Now what folly it is, not to remember the time, and the men.
Or who will speake that which he knoweth will not be liked,
if he purpose to finde fauour at their hands, before whome he
speaketh, what man of reason, will praise that before the
Iudges (before whom he knoweth the determination of his
cause resteth) which the Iudges them selues cannot abide to
heare spoken at all?  Or doeth not so much hinder his owne
matter, that without all curtesie or preface made, will largely
speake euill of those men, whom the hearers of his cause
tenderly do fauour?  Or be it that there be some notable fault
in thine aduersarie, with which the Iudges also are infected,
were it not folly for thee to charge thine aduersarie with the
same.  Considering the Iudges thereby may think, thou speakest
against them also, and so thou maiest perhaps lose their fauour,
in seeking such defence made without all discretion.  And in
framing reasons to confirme the purpose, if any be spoken
plainly false, or els contrarie to that which was spoken before,
doeth it not much hinder a good matter?  Therefore in all
causes this good heed ought to be had, that alwaies we labour
to do some good in furthering of our cause, or if we cannot so
doe, at the least that we do no harme at al.</p>

beeing brother to the worthie King of famous memorie Henry
the eight, was in such fauour, and did such seruice, that all
England at this howre doth finde his lacke, and France yet
doth feele that such a Duke there was, whom in his life time
the Godly loued: the euill feared, the wise men honoured for
his witte, and the simple vsed alwaies for their counsaile.
Their mother of birth noble, and witte great, of nature gentle,
and mercifull to the poore, and to the Godly, and especially
to the learned an earnest good Patronesse, and most helping
Ladie aboue all other.  In their youth their father died, the
eldest of them beeing not past nine yeares of age.  After whose
death, their mother knowing, that wealth without wit, is like
a sworde in a naked mans hande, and assuredly certaine, that
knowledge would confirme iudgement, prouided so for their
bringing vp in all vertue and learning, that two like were not
to bee had within this Realme againe.  When they began
both to ware somewhat in yeares, being in their primetide and
spring of their age, the elder wayting on the Kings Maiestie
that now is, was generally wel esteemed, and such hope was
conceiued of his towardnesse, both for learning and al other
things, that fewe were like vnto him in al the Court.  The
other keeping his booke among the Cambrige men profited
(as they well knowe) both in vertue and learning, to their great
admiration.  For the Greeke, the Latine, and the Italian, I
know he could do more, then would be thought true by my
report.  I leaue to speake of his skill in pleasant Instrumentes,
neither will I vtter his aptnesse in Musicke, and his toward
Nature, to all exercises of the body.  But his elder brother
in this time (besides his other giftes of the minde, which
passed all other, and were almost incredible) following his
fathers nature, was so delited with ryding, and runnyng in
armour vpon horsebacke, and was so comely for that fact, and
could dooe so well in charging his Staffe, beeing but xiiii.
yeeres of age, that men of warre, euen at this howre, mone
much the want of such a worthy Gentleman.  Yea, the French
men that first wondered at his learning, when he was there
among them, and made a notable oration in Latine: were
much more astonied when they sawe his comely riding, and
little thought to finde these two ornaments ioyned both in
one, his yeares especially being so tender, and his practise of

<pb n="16"/>

so small tyme.  Afterward comming from the Court, as one
that was desirous to be among the learned, he lay in <reg orig="Cam-bridge">Cambridge</reg>
together with his brother, where they both so profited,
and so gently vsed themselues, that all Cambridge did <reg orig="reuer-ence">reuerence</reg>,
both him and his brother, as two Iewels sent from God.
The elders nature was such, that hee thought himself best,
when he was among the wisest, and yet contemned none, but
thankfully vsed al, gentle in behauiour without childishnesse,
stout of stomack without al pride, bold with all warenesse, and
friendly with good aduisement.  The yonger being not so ripe
in yeres, was not so graue in looke, rather cherefull, then
sad: rather quicke, then auncient: but yet if his brother were
set aside, not one that went beyond him.  A child, that by his
owne inclination, so much yeelded to his ruler, as few by
chastment haue done the like: pleasant of speech, prompt of
wit, stirring by nature, hault without hate, kind without craft,
liberall of heart, gentle in behauiour, forward in all things,
greedie of learning, &amp; loth to take a foile in any open  <reg orig="assem-bly">assembly</reg>.
They both in all attempts, sought to haue the victorie,
and in exercise of wit, not only the one with the other, did
oft stand in contention, but also they both would match with
the best, and thought them selues most happie, when they
might haue any iust occasion, to put their wittes in triall.
And now when this greene fruite began to waxe ripe, and all
men longed to haue a taste of such their great forwardnesse:
God preuenting mans expectation, tooke them both about
one howre, and in so shorte time, that first they were knowne
to be dead, or any abroad could tel they were sicke.  I neede
not to rehearse, what both they spake, before their departure
(considering, I haue seuerally written, both in Latine and in
English, of the same matter) neither will I heape here so much
together, as I can, because I should rather renew great sorrow
to many, then doe most men any great good, who loued them
so well generally, that fewe for a great space after, spake of
these two Gentlemen, but they shewed teares, with the only
vtterance of their wordes, and some through ouer much
sorrowing, were faine to forbeare speaking.  GOD graunt vs
all to liue, that the good men of this world, may bee alwaies
loth to forsake vs, and God may still be glad to haue vs, as no
doubt these two children so died, as all men should wish to

liue, and so they liued both, as al should wish to dye.  Seeing
therefore, these two were such, both for birth, nature, and all
other giftes of grace, that the like are hardly found behind
them: Let vs so speak of them, that our good reporte may
warne vs, to followe their godly natures, and that lastly, we
may enioye that inheritance, whereunto God hath prepared
them and vs (that feare him) from the beginning.  Amen.

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Dauid <reg orig="com-mended">commended</reg>
for killing Goliah.</note>

<p>GOD being the aucthour of mankinde, powring into him
the breath of life, and framing him of clay, in such a
comely wise as wee all now see, hath from the beginning,
beene so carefull ouer his elect and chosen, that in al
daungers, he is euer readie to assist his people, keeping them
harmlesse, when they were often past all mans hope.  And
among all other his fatherly goodnesse, it pleased him to shewe
his power to his chosen seruaunt Dauid, that al might learne
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Who? Dauid
against Goliah.</note>
to knowe his might, and recken with themselues, that though
man giue the stroke, yet God it is that giueth the ouerhand.
For wher as Dauid was of small stature, weake of bodie, poore
of birth, and base in the sight of the worldlings, God called
him first to match with an huge monster, a little bodie,
against a mightie Gyaunt, an abiect Israelite, against a most
valiaunt Philistine, with whom no Israelite durst encounter.
These Philistines, trusting in their owne strength so much that
they feared no perrill, but made an accompt, that all was theirs
before hand.  Now, when both these armies were in sight,
the Philistines vpon an hill of the one side, and the Israelites
vpon an hill of the other side, a vale beeing betwixt them both,
there marched out of the Campe, a base borne Philistine,
called Goliah of Geth, a man of sixe Cubites high.  This
Souldier, when through his bignesse and stature of his bodie,
and also with great bragges, and terrible threatninges, he had
wonderfully abashed the whole Armie of the Israelites, so that

<pb n="19"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">19</fw>

no man durst aduenture vpon him.  God to the end he might
deliuer Israell, and shew that mans helpe, with all his armour,
litle auaile to get victorie, without his especiall grace: and
againe, to the end he might set vp Dauid, and make him
honourable among the Israelites, did then call out Dauid, the
sonne of <emph>Ephrateus</emph>, of <emph>Bethleem Iuda</emph>, whose name was <emph>Isaie</emph>,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">What? Dauid
killed Goliah.
Where? About
the vale of
 <reg orig="Terebin-thus">Terebinthus</reg>.</note>
who being but a childe in yeres, did kill out of hand, by Gods
might and power, Goliath the most terrible enemie of all
other, that bare hate against the children of Israell.  When
this mightie fellowe was slaine, about the vale of <emph>Terebinthus</emph>,
betwixt both the Armies, the Israelites reioysed, that before
quaked, and wondered at him then, whom they would scant
knowe before, and no doubt this deede was not only <reg orig="wonder-full">wonderfull</reg>,
but also right godly.  For in battaile to kill an enemie,
is thought right worthie, or to aduenture vpon a Rebell
(though the successe followe not) is generally commended, yea,
to put one to the worse, or to make him flie the ground, is
called manly, but what shal we say of Dauid, that not onely
had the better hande, not onely bet his enemie, but killed
streight his enemie, yea, and not an enemie of the common
stature of men, but a mightie Gyant, not a man, but a
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Dauids enterprise, honest
&amp; godly. By what help,

monster, yea, a deuill in heart, and a beast in bodie?  Can any
be compted more honest then such as seeke to saue their
Countrey, by hassarding their carcasses, and shedding of their
bloud?  Can loue shew it self greater, then by yeelding of life,
for the health of an army?  It had been much, if halfe a dosen
had dispatched such a terrible Giaunt, but now, when Dauid
without helpe, being not yet a man but a boye in yeares,
slewe him hand to hand, what iust praise doth he deserue?  If
we praise other, that haue slaine euil men, and compt them
haultie, that haue killed their matches, what shall wee say of
Dauid, that being wonderfully ouermatched, made his partie

good, and got the Gole of a Monster.  Let other praise
<emph>Hercules</emph>, that thinke best of him: let <emph>C&aelig;sar, Alexander</emph>, and
<emph>Hanniball</emph>, bee bruted for Warriers: Dauid in my iudgement,
both did more manly, then all the other were able, and serued his
Countrey in greater daunger, then euer any one of them did.
And shall we not call such a noble Captaine, a good man of
warre.  Deserueth not his manhoode and stout attempt,
wonderfull praise?  If vertue could speake, would she not sone

confesse, that Dauid had her in full possession?  And therefore,
if well doinges, by right may chalenge worthie Brute, Dauid
will be knowne, and neuer can want due praise, for such an
honest deede.  And what man will not say, but that Dauid did
minde nothing els herein, but the sauegarde of his Countrey,
thinking it better for himselfe to dye, and his Countrey to
liue, then himselfe to liue, and his Countrey to dye.  What
gaine got Dauid, by the death of Goliath, or what could he
hope, by the death of such a Monster, but onely that the loue
which he bare to the Israelites, forced him to hassarde his
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Dauids enterprise, profitable
to himself and his Countrey.</note>
owne life: thinking that if the Philistines should preuaile, the
Israelites were like to perrish, euery mothers sonne of them?
Therefore, hee hassarding this attempt, considered with <reg orig="him-selfe">himselfe</reg>,
the sauegarde of the Israelites, the maintenaunce of
Iustice, his duetie towards GOD, his obedience to his Prince,
and his loue to his Countrey.  And no doubt, God made
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Dauids enterprise, appereth
easie to himselfe.</note>
this enterprise appere full easie, before Dauid could haue the
heart to match himselfe with such a one.  For though his
heart might quake, being voyde of Gods helpe, yet assuredly he
wanted no stomacke, when God did set him on.  Let Tyraunts
rage, let Hell stande open, let Sathan shewe his might, if God be
with vs, who can be against vs?  Though this Goliah appeared
so strong, that ten Dauids were not able to stande in his
hande: yet tenne Goliahs were all euer weake for Dauid alone.
Man can not judge, neither can reason comprehend the
mightie power of God.</p>

<p>When Pharao with all his Armie, thought fully to destroye
the children of Israell in the red Sea, did not God preserue
Moses, and destroyed Pharao?  What is man, and all his power
that he can make, in the handes of GOD, vnto whom all
creatures both in heauen and in earth, are subiect at his
commaundement?  Therefore, it was no masterie for Dauid,
beeing assisted with GOD, aswell to match with the whole
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Dauids enterprise
accompted of his
friends hard and
impossible.</note>
Armie, as to ouerthrow this one man.  But what did the
Israelites, when they sawe Dauid take vppon him such a
bolde enterprise?  Some sayd he was rash, other mocked him
to scorne, and his brethren called him foole.  For thought
they, what a mad fellowe is he, being but a lad in yeares, to
match with such a monster in bodie?  How can it be possible
otherwise, but that he shall be torne in peeces, euen at the

<pb n="21"/>

first comming?  For if the Philistine may once hit him, he is
gon though he had ten mens liues.  Now what should he
meane, so vnegally to match himselfe, except he were wearie
of his life, or els were not well in his wittes?  Yea, and to
giue his enemies all the aduauntage that could be, he came
vnarmed, and whereas the Philistine had very strong Armour,
both to defende himselfe, and a strong weapon to fight
withall: Dauid came with a Sling onely, as though he would
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">How? with

kill Crowes, whereat, not onely the Philistine laughed and
disdained his follie, but also both the Armies thought he was
but a dead man, before he gaue one stroke.  And in deede,
by all reason and deuise of man, there was none other way,
but death with him out of hande.  Dauid notwithstanding,
beeing kindeled in heart, with Gods might, was strong
enough for him, in his owne opinion, and forced nothing
though all other were much against him.  And therefore,
made no more a doe, but being readie to reuenge in Gods
name, such great blasphemie, as the Philistine then did vtter:
marched towarde his enemie, and with casting a stone out of
a Sling, he ouerthrew the Philistine at the first.  The which
when he had done, out with his sworde and chopt of his head,
carying it with his armour, to the Campe of the Israelites:
whereat the Philistines were greatly astonied, and the Israelites
much praised GOD, that had giuen such grace to such a one,
to compasse such a deede.  And the rather this manly act, is
highly to bee praised, because he subdued this huge enemie,
when Saull first reigned King of Israel, and was sore assailed
with the great armie of the Philistines.  Let vs therefore that
be now liuing, when this act or such like, come into our
mindes: remember what God is, of how infinite power he is,
and let vs praise God in them, by whom he hath wrought such

countrey is able long to continue.  Then may I be bolde to
commende that, which all men wish, and fewe can haue,
which all men loue, and none can want: not doubting, but
as I am occupied in a good thing, so al good men will heare
me with a good will.  But would God I were so well able, to
perswade all men to Iustice, as all men knowe the necessarie
vse thereof: and then vndoubtedly, I would bee much bolder,
and force some by violence, which by faire wordes cannot bee
entreated.  And yet what needes any perswasion for that thing,
which by nature is so needfull, &amp; by experience so profitable,
that looke what we want, without Iustice we get not, looke
what we haue: without Iustice wee keepe not.  God graunt
vs his grace so to worke in the hearts of al men, that they
may aswell practise well doing in their owne life, as they
would that other should followe Iustice in their life: I for my
part will bestowe some labour, to set forth the goodnesse of
vpright dealing, that all other men the rather may doe
thereafter.  That if through my wordes, GOD shall worke
with any man, then may I thinke my selfe in happie case, and
reioyce much in the trauaile of my witte.  And how can it
be otherwise, but that all men shalbe forced inwardly to

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Iustice naturally in
euery one of vs.</note>
allow that, which in outwarde act many doe not followe:
seeing God powred first this lawe of nature, into mans heart,
and graunted it as a meane, whereby wee might knowe his
will, and (as I might saye) talke with him, grounding still his
doinges vppon this poinct, that man should doe as he would
bee done vnto, the which is nothing els, but to liue vprightly,
without any will to hurt his neighbour.  And therefore,
hauing this light of Gods will opened vnto vs, through his
mere goodnesse, we ought euermore, to referre all our actions
vnto this ende, both in giuing iudgement, and deuising Lawes
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Iustice what it is,
and how largely it
extendeth.</note>
necessarie for mans life.  And hereupon it is, that when men
desire the Lawe, for triall of a matter, they meane nothing
els but to haue Iustice, the which Iustice is a vertue that
yeeldeth to euery man his owne: to the euer liuing God loue
aboue all things: to the King obedience: to the inferiour
good counsaile: to the poore man, mercy: to the hatefull and
wicked, sufferaunce: to it self, trueth: and to all men,
perfite peace and charitie.  Now, what can be more saied, in
praise of this vertue, or what thing can be like praised?  Are

<pb n="25"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">25</fw>

not all things in good case, when all men haue their owne?
And what other thing doth Iustice, but seeketh meanes to
content all parties?  Then how greatly are they to be praised,
that meane truely in al their doinges, not onely doe no harme
to any, but seeke meanes to helpe al.  The Sunne is not so
wonderfull to the world (saith <emph>Aristotle</emph>) as the iust dealing of
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Aristotle.</note>
a gouernour, is marueilous to all men.  No, the earth yeeldeth
no more gaine to all creatures, then doth the Iustice of a
Magistrate, to his whole Realme.  For by a Lawe, we liue,
and take the fruites of the earth, but where no Lawe is, nor
Iustice vsed: there nothing can bee had, though all thinges be
at hand: for in hauing the thing, we shall lacke the vse, and
liuing in great plentie, wee shall stande in great neede.  The
meane therefore, that maketh men to enioye their owne, is
Iustice, the which being once taken away, all other thinges
are lost with it, neither can any one saue that he hath, nor
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Wrong dealing
deserueth death.</note>
yet get that he wanteth.  Therefore, if wrong doing should
be borne withall, and not rather punished by death, what man
could liue in rest?  Who could bee sure either of his life, or of
his liuing one whole day together?  Now, because euery man
desireth the preseruation of himselfe, euery man should in like
case desire the sauegard of his neighbour.  For if I should
wholly minde myne owne ease, and followe gaine without
respect, to the hinderaunce of myne euen Christian: why
should not other vse the same libertie, and so euery man for
himselfe, and the Deuill for vs al, catch that catch may?  The
which custome if all men followed, the earth would sone be
voyd, for want of men one would be so greedy to eate vp an
other.  For in seeking to liue, wee would lose our liues, and
in gaping after goodes, wee should soone goe naked. <reg orig="There-fore">Therefore</reg>,
to represse this rage, and with wholsome deuises to

that in all thinges he may see what is right, and what

is wrong, and vpon good aduisement deale iustly with all

man, for mans sake, that one man might helpe an other.
For though some one haue giftes more plentifully then the

other.  Therefore wee should striue one to helpe an other by

Then if we doe not iustice (wherein loue doth consist) we

The beginning of a good life, is to doe Iustice.  Yea, the

what ease he shall finde thereby, and I doubt not, but euery
one deepely waying the same, will in heart confesse, that
Iustice maketh plentie, &amp; that no man could long hold

should haue his owne?  Would seruaunts obeye their maisters,
the sonne his father, the Tenaunt his Landlord, the Citezein
his Maior or Sherief if orders were not set, &amp; iust dealing
appointed for all states of men?  Therfore, the true meaning
folke in al ages giue themselues some to this occupation, and
some to that, seking therin nothing els but to maintain a poore
life, and to kepe themselues true men, both to GOD and the
world.  What maketh men to performe their bargaines, to
stand to their promises, and yeeld their debtes, but an order
of a law grounded vpon Iustice?  Where right beareth rule,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Where iustice is

there craft is compted vice.  The liar is much hated, where
trueth is well esteemed.  The wicked theeues are hanged,
where good men are regarded.  None can hold vp their
heads, or dare shewe their faces, in a well ruled common
weale, that are not thought honest, or at the least haue some
honest way to liue.  The Egiptians therefore, hauing a worthy

England, how many would come behind hand with their
reckenings at the audite day.  I feare me their doings would
be such, that it would be long ere they got their quietus est.
Therfore the worse is our state, the lesse that this euill is
looked vnto.  And surely, if in other thinges wee should bee
as negligent, this Realme could not long stand.  But thankes
be to God, wee hang them a pace, that offend a lawe, and
therefore, wee put it to their choyce, whether they wilbe
idle, and so fall to stealing or no? they knowe their reward,
goe to it when they wil.  But if therewithal some good order

were taken, for education of youth, and setting loyterers on
worke (as thanks be to God, the Citie is most godly bent
that way) all would sone be well, without all doubt.  The
wise and discrete persons in al ages, sought all meanes possible,
to haue an order in all thinges, and loued by Iustice to direct
all their doinges, whereby appeareth both an apt will in such
men, and a naturall stirring by Gods power, to make all men
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Iustice, easie to

good.  Therefore if we do not well, we must blame our
selues, that lack a will, &amp; do not call to God for grace.  For
though it appere hard to do wel, because no man can get
perfection, without continuance: yet assuredly to an humble
mind that calleth to God, &amp; to a willing heart that faine
would do his best, nothing can be hard.  God hath set al
things to sale for labor, &amp; keepeth open shop come who wil.
Therefore in all ages, whereas we see the fewest good we
must well thinke, the most did lacke good will to aske, or
seeke for the same.  Lord what loue had that worthie Prince

<emph>Seleucus</emph> to maintaine Iustice, and to haue good lawes kept, of
whom such a wonderfull thing is written.  For whereas he
established most wholesome lawes, for sauegard of the <emph> <reg orig="Locren-sians">Locrensians</reg></emph>,
and his owne sonne thereupon taken in adultery, should
lose both his eyes, according to the lawe then made, and
yet notwithstanding, the whole Citie thought, to remit the
necessitie of his punishment, for the honour of his father,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes"><emph>Valer. li. vi.</emph></note>
<emph>Seleucus</emph> would none of that in any wise.  Yet at last, through
importunitie being ouercome, he caused first one of his own
eyes to be pluckt out, and next after, one of his sonnes eyes,
leauing onely the vse of sight, to himselfe and his sonne.
Thus through equitie of the law, he vsed the due meane of
chastisement, shewing himselfe by a wonderfull temperature,
both a mercifull father, and a iust law maker.  Now happie
are they that thus obserue a Lawe, thinking losse of bodie,
lesse hurt to the man, then sparing of punishment, meete for
the soule.  For GOD will not faile them, that haue such
a desire to followe his will, but for his promise sake, he will
rewarde them for euer.  And now, seing that Iustice
naturally is giuen to al men, without the which he could not
liue, being warned also by GOD, alwaies to doe vprightly,
perceiuing againe the commodities, that redounde vnto vs,
by liuing vnder a Lawe, and the sauegarde, wherein we stand,

hauing Iustice to assist vs: I trust that not onely all men, will

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Naturall loue.</note>
Naturall loue, is an inward good will, that we beare to
our parents, wife, children, or any other that be nigh of
kinne vnto vs, stirred thereunto not onely by our flesh,
thinking that like as we would loue our selues, so wee should
loue them, but also by a likenesse of minde: and therefore
generally we loue all, because all be like vnto vs, but yet we
loue them most, that both in bodie and mynd be most like
vnto vs.  And hereby it commeth, that often we are liberall
and bestowe our goodes vpon the needie, remembring that
they are all one flesh with vs, and should not want when we
haue it, without our great rebuke and token of our most
vnkind dealing.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes"> <reg orig="Thankeful-nesse">Thankefulnesse</reg>.</note>
Thankfulnesse is a requiting of loue, for loue, and will, for

in them: yea, striuing to passe them in kindnesse, losing
neither time nor tide to doe them good.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Stoutnesse.</note>
Stoutnesse to withstand and reuenge euil, is then vsed when
either we are like to haue harme, &amp; doe withstand it, or els
when we haue suffered euill for the trueth sake, and  <reg orig="there-upon">thereupon</reg>
doe reuenge it, or rather punish the euill, which is in
the man.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Reuerence.</note>
Reuerence, is an humblenesse in outward behauour, when
we doe our duetie to them, that are our betters, or vnto such
as are called to serue the King in some greate vocation.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Assured and

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Right by custome.</note>
That is right by custome, which long time hath confirmed,
being partly grounded vpon nature, &amp; partly vpon reason, as
where wee are taught by nature, to knowe the euer liuing

into blind custome, without Gods will, haue vsed at length

in shauen Crownes, and long Gownes, and many good
morowes els, deuised only by the phantasie of man, without
the expresse will of God.  The which childish toyes, time

deale truely, custome encreaseth natures wil, &amp; maketh by
auncient demeane things to be iustly obserued, which nature
hath appointed.

<p>BArgaining is, when two haue agreed for the sale of some
one thing, the one will make his fellowe to stand to the
bargaine though it be to his neighbours vndoing, resting vpon
this point, that a bargaine is a bargaine, and must stande

be builded vpon iustice, whereby an vpright dealing, and
a charitable loue, is vttered amongst all men.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Commons.</note>
Commons or equalitie, is when the people by long time
haue a ground, or any such thing among them, the which
some of them will keep still for custome sake, and not suffer
it to be fenced, and so turned to pasture, though they might
gaine ten times the value: but such stubburnesse in keeping
of commons for custome sake, is not standing with Iustice,
because it is holden against al right.</p>

not in the Vineyard of the Lorde.  For although none should
followe any trade of life for the gaine sake, but euen as he
seeth it is most necessarie, for the aduauncement of Gods
glorie, and not passe in what estimation things are had in
this worlde: yet because we are all so weake of witte in our
tender yeres, that we can not weigh with our selues what is
best, and our bodie so nesh, that it loketh euer to be
cherished, we take that which is moste gainefull for vs, and
forsake that altogether, which wee ought most to followe.
So, that for lacke of honest meanes, and for want of good
order: the best way is not vsed, neither is Gods honour in
our first yeeres remembred.  I had rather (sayde one) make
my child a Cobler, then a Preacher, a Tankerd bearer, then

hee shall neuer get thereby any liuing?  Set my sonne to that,
whereby he may get somewhat?  Doe ye not see, how euery

I feare me one day, they wil pluck doune Church and all.
Call you this the Gospell, when men seeke onely to prouide

matter to become a Lawier.  The which, if I shall bee able
to proue.  I doubt not, but he will proue a good Lawyer,
and that right shortly: the Lawe is grounded vpon reason.
And what hardnesse is it for a man by a reason, to finde out

whereof is graffed in his breast.  What, though the Lawe be
in a straunge tongue, the wordes may bee gotte without any

a little Lawe will make a greate shewe, and therefore, though
it bee much to become excellent, yet it is easie to get a taste.
And surely for getting of money, a little will doe asmuch
good oftentymes, as a great deale.  There is not a word in
the Law, but it is a grote in the Lawiers purse.  I haue
knowne diuers, that by familiar talking and mouting together,
haue come to right good learning, without any great booke
skill, or much beating of their braine, by any close studie or
secret musing in their Chamber.  But where some saie the

Whereupon your freends with one consent, haue offered you

which, whosoeuer shall dispraise, is condemned straight for an

flood being reconciled to mankinde, is said to proclaime this
law first of all, not that men should liue single, but that they
should encrease, bee multiplied and fill the earth.  But howe
I pray you could this thing bee, sauing by Mariage and

commendable report of Christ in the Gospell, for this cause
(saieth he) shall man leaue father and mother, and cleaue to
his wife.  And what is more holy then the reuerence and
loue due vnto parents?  And yet the trueth promised in
Matrimonie, is preferred before it, and by whose meanes?
Marie by God himself, at what time?  Forsooth not only
among the Iewes, but also among the Christians.  Men
forsake father and mother, and takes themselues wholy to
their wiues.  The sonne being past twentie yeeres, is free and
at libertie.  Yea, the sonne being abdicated be commeth no
sonne.  But it is death onely that parteth maried folke, if yet
death doth parte them.  Nowe, if the other Sacraments
(whereunto the Church of Christ chiefly leaneth) be <reg orig="reuer-ently">reuerently</reg>
vsed, who doeth not see, that this Sacrament, should
haue the most reuerence of all, the which was instituted of
God, and that first and before all other.  As for the other,

the other were giuen for a remedie, this was appointed for
the felowship of felicitie: the other were applied to mans

most perfite state.  If we coumpt those Lawes good, that
mortall men haue enacted, shall not the lawe of Matrimonie
bee most holy, which wee haue receiued of him, by whom we
haue receiued life, the which Lawe was then together enacted,
when man was first created?  And lastly, to strengthen this
Lawe, with an example and deede doen, Christ being a yong
man (as the storie reporteth) was called to Mariage, and came
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Mariage beautified

thether willingly with his mother, and not only was he there
present, but also he did honest the feast with a wonderfull
maruaile, beginning first in none other place, to worke his
wonders and to doe his miracles.  Why then I praie you (will
one saie) how happeneth it, that Christ forbare Mariage?  As
though good sir, there are not many things in Christ, at the
which we ought rather to maruaile, then seeke to follow.
He was borne, and had no father, he came into this world,
without his mothers painfull trauaile, he came out of the
graue when it was closed vp, what is not in him aboue
nature?  Let these things be proper vnto him.  Let vs that
liue within the bounds of nature, reuerence those things that
are aboue nature, and followe such things as are within our
reache, such as wee are able to compasse.  But yet (you say)
hee would bee borne of a virgin: of a virgin (I graunt) but
yet of a maried virgin.  A virgin being a mother did moste
become God, and being maried, she shewed what was best for
vs to do.  Virginitie did become her, who being vndefiled
brought him forth by heauenly inspiration, that was vndefiled.
And yet Ioseph being her housbande, doeth commend vnto
vs the lawe of chast Wedlock.  Yea, how could he better set
out the societie in Wedlocke, than that willing to declare the
secrete societie of his Diuine nature, with the bodie and soule
of man which is wonderfull, euen to the heauenly Angels,
and to shewe his vnspeakable and euer abiding loue toward
his church: He doth call himself the Bridegrome, and her the
bride.  Greate is the Sacrament of Matrimonie (saieth Paule)
betwixt Christ and his Church.  If there had been vnder
heauen, any holier yoke, if there had bene any more religious
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Mariage

couenaunt, then is Matrimonie, without doubt the example
thereof had bene vsed.  But what like thing to you reade in
all scripture of the single life?  The Apostle S. Paule in the
thirteene Chapter of his Epistle to the Hebrues, calleth

<pb n="43"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">43</fw>

Matrimonie honorable among all men, and the bed vndefiled,
&amp; yet the single life is not so much as once named in the
same place.  Nay, they are not borne withall that liue single,
except they make some recompence, with doing some great
thing.  For els, if a man following the law of Nature, doe
labour to get children, he is euer to be preferred before him,
that liueth still vnmaried, for none other end, but because
he would bee out of trouble, and liue more free.  We doe
reade, that such as are in very deede chast of their body, and
liue a virgines life, haue bene praised: but the single life was
neuer praised of it selfe.  Now, againe the law of Moses,
accursed the barrennesse of maried folk: and we doe reade
that some were excommunicated, for the same purpose, and
banished from the Altar.  And wherfore I praie you?  Marie

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Deut. vi.</note>
sir, because that they like vnprofitable persons, and liuing
onely to themselues, did not encrease the worlde with any
issue.  In Deuteronomi, it was the cheefest token of Gods
blessinges vnto the Israelites, that none should be barren
among them, neither man, nor yet woman.  And Lia is
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Lia.</note>
thought to be out of Gods fauour because she could not bring
forth children.  Yea, and the Psalme of Dauid. 128. it is
coumpted on of the cheefest partes of blisse, to be a fruitfull
woman.  Thy wife (saieth the Psalme) shalbe plentifull like
a Vine.  And thy children like the branches of Oliues, round
about thy table.  Then if the law doe condemne, and vtterly
disalowe barren Matrimonie, it hath alwaies muche more
condemned the single life of Batchlars.  If the fault of nature
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Hebrues law for
maried folke.</note>
hath not escaped blame, the will of man can neuer want
rebuke.  If they are accursed that would haue children, and
can get none, what deserue thei which neuer trauaile to escape
barrennes?  The Hebrues had such a reuerence to maried
folke, that he which had maried a wife, the same yeere should
not be forced to goe on warfare.  A Citie is like to fal to
ruine, except there be watchmen to defend it with armor.
But assured destruction must here nedes folow, except men
through the benefite of mariage supplie issue, the which
through mortalitie, doe from time to time decaie.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Plutarchus in the

     Ouer and besides this, the Romaines did laie a penaltie

suffer them to beare any office in the Commonweale.  But

<pb n="44"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">44</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

they that had encreased the world with issue, had a rewarde
by common assent, as men that did deserue well of their
countrey.  The olde foren lawes did appoint penalties for
such as liued single, the which although, they were qualified
by <emph>Constancius</emph> the Emperour, in the fauour of Christes
Religion: yet these lawes doe declare, how little it is for the
common weales aduauncement, that either a Citie should be
lesned for loue of sole life, or els that the Countrey should be
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus C&aelig;sar.</note>
filled full of Bastards.  And besides this, the Emperour
<emph>Augustus</emph>, being a sore punisher of euill behauiour, examined
a soldiour because he did not marie his wife, according to
the lawes, the which soldiour had hardly escaped iudgement,
if he had not got three children by her.  And in this point
doe the lawes of the Emperours, seeme fauourable to maried
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Miscella.</note>
folke, that they abrogate such vowes, as were proclaimed to
be kept, and brought in by <emph>Miscella</emph>, and would that after the
penaltie were remitted, such couenaunts being made against
all right and conscience, should also be taken of none effect,
and as voyde in the lawe.  Ouer and besides this, <emph>Vlpianus</emph>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Vlpianus.</note>
doth declare, that the matter of Dowries was euermore, and
in al places the chiefest aboue all other, the which should
neuer haue been so, except there came to the Common weale,
some especiall profite by Mariage.  Mariage hath euer beene
reuerenced, but fruitfulnesse of body, hath been much more,
for so soone as one got the name of a father, there discended
not onely vnto him inheritaunce of land, but all bequestes, and
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Iuuenall.</note>
goods of such his freendes, as dyed intestate.  The which
thing appeareth plainly, by the <emph>Satyre</emph> Poet.
</p>
<lg type="verse">

<p>Now he that hath three children, was more fauoured, for
he was exempted from all outwarde ambassages.  Againe, hee
that had fiue children, was discharged &amp; free from all
personall office, as to haue the gouernaunce, or patronage of
young Gentlemen, the which in those daies was a greate
charge, and full of paines, without any profite at al.
He that had thirtene children, was free by the Emperour
Iulianus lawe, not onely from being a man of armes, or

a Captaine ouer horsemen: but also from all other offices in
the common weale.  And the wise founders of al lawes,
giue good reason why such fauour was shewed to maried folke.
For what is more blesseful then to liue euer?  Now, where as
nature hath denied this, Matrimonie doeth giue it by
a certaine sleight, so much as may be.  Who doth not desire
to bee bruted, and liue through fame among men hereafter?
Now, there is no building of Pillers, no erecting of Arches,
no blasing of Armes, that doth more set forth a mans name,
then doth the encrease of children.  <emph>Albinus</emph> obteined his
purpose of the Emperour <emph>Adrian</emph>, for none other desert of his,
but that he had begot an house full of children.  And
therefore the Emperour (to the hinderance of his treasure)

had iustly deserued such punishment, because they did not

will yee knowe how much our olde auncesters heretofore
esteemed Matrimonie?  Weigh well, and consider the <reg orig="punish-ment">punishment</reg>
for breaking of wedlock.  The Greekes heretofore
thought it meete, to punish the breach of Matrimonie with
battaile, that continued ten yeres.  Yea, moreouer not onely
by the Romaine Lawe, but also by the Hebrues and straungers,
aduouterers persons were punished with death.  If a theefe
paied fower times the value of that which he tooke awaie, he
was deliuered: but an aduouterers offence, was punished with

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sword.  Among the Hebrues, the people stoned the
aduouterers to death with their owne handes, because they
had broken that, without which the worlde could not continue.
And yet they thought not this sore Law sufficient enough,
but graunted further to run him through without Lawe, that
was taken in aduoutrie, as who should say, they graunted that
to the greefe of maried folke, the which they would hardly

graunt to him, that stood in his owne defence for saufegard
of his life, as though he offended more hainously that tooke
a mans wife, then hee did that tooke away a mans life.
Assuredly Wedlocke must needes seeme to be a most holy
thing, considering, that being once broken, it must needes
bee purged with mans bloud, the reuenger whereof, is not
forced to abide, either Lawe or Iudge, the which libertie is
not graunted any, to vse vpon hym that hath killed, either
his father or his mother.  But what doe wee with these
Lawes written?  This is the law of nature, not written in the
Tables of Brasse, but firmely printed in our mindes, the which
Lawe, whosoeuer doth not obeye, he is not worthie to be
called a man, much lesse shall he be compted a Citezen.  For,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes"> <reg orig="Matrimo-nie">Matrimonie</reg>
naturall.</note>
if to liue well (as the Stoikes wittely doe dispute) is to followe
the course of nature, what thing is so agreeing with nature,
as Matrimonie?  For there is nothing so naturall, not onely
vnto mankind, but also vnto all other liuing creatures, as it
is for euery one of them, to keepe their owne kind from
decaie, and through increase of issue, to make their whole
kinde immortall.  The which thing (all men knowe) can
neuer be doen without Wedlocke, and carnall copulation.
It were a foule thing that brute beastes should obey the Lawe
of nature, and men like Giauntes should fight against Nature.
Whose worke, if we would narrowly looke vpon, we shall

<p>I will not speake now of Trees, wherein (as <emph>Plinie</emph> most

would say) vpon it.  But I thinke it ouer tedious, to runne
ouer all things.  And to what end are these things spoken?
Mary sir, because we might vnderstande, that through Mariage,
all things are and doe still continue, and with out the same,
all things doe decay and come to naught.  The olde auncient
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">The fable of Giauntes
that fought against

and most wise Poets doe feigne (who had euer a desire vnder
the colour of fables, to set forth precepts of Philosophie) that
the Giauntes, which had Snakes feete, and were borne of the
earth, builded great hilles that mounted vp to heauen,
minding thereby to bee at vtter defiance with God, and all
his Angels.  And what meaneth this fable?  Marie, it sheweth
vnto vs, that certaine fierce and sauage men, such as were
vnknowne, could not abide wedlock for any worlds good, and
therefore they were striken doune hedlong with lidghtning,
that is to say: they were vtterly destroyed, when they sought
to eschue that, whereby the weale and saufegard of all <reg orig="man-kind">mankind</reg>,
onely doth consist.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Orpheus.</note>
Now againe, the same Poets doe declare that Orpheus the

what is their meaning herein?  Assuredly nothing els, but that
a wise and well spoken man, did call backe harde harted men,
such as liued abrode like beastes from open whoredom, &amp;
brought them to liue after the most holy lawes of Matrimonie.
Thus we see plainly, that such a one as hath no mind of
mariage, seemeth to be no man but rather a stone, an enemie
to nature, a rebell to God himselfe, seeking through his owne
folly, his last ende and destruction.</p>

what other thing doe we thinke, that the Poets meant, but
onely to set forth vnto vs, the loue in wedlocke, the which
euen among the Deuilles, was coumpted good and godly.</p>

<p>And this also makes well for the purpose, that in olde tyme

<pb n="48"/>

they made <emph>Iupiter Gamelius</emph>, the God of Marriage, and <emph>Iuno

naming of the Gods: and yet not missing the trueth, in declaring
that Matrimony is an holy thing, and meete for the <reg orig="worthi-nesse">worthinesse</reg>
therof, that the Gods in heauen should haue care ouer
it.  Among diuers Countries and diuers men, there haue
beene diuers lawes and Customes vsed.  Yet was there neuer
any Countrey so sauage, none so farre from al humanitie,
where the name of Wedlocke was not coumpted holie, and

there be any that dwell beyond them?  Marie, because that thing
must needes be common to all, which the common mother vnto
all, hath graffed in vs all, and hath so throughly graffed the
same in vs, that not only Stockdoues and Pigions, but also
the most wilde beasts, haue a Naturall feeling of this thing.
For the Lions are gentle against the Lionesse.  The Tygers
fight for safegarde of their young whelpes.  The Asse runnes
through the hot fire (which is made to keepe her away) for
safegarde of her issue.  And this they call the lawe of Nature,
the which as it is of most strength &amp; force, so it spreadeth
abroad most largely.  Therefore, as he is coumpted no good
Gardener, that being content with thinges present, doth
diligently proyne his olde Trees, and hath no regarde either
to ympe or graffe yong Settes: because the selfe same Orchard
(though it bee neuer so well trimmed) must needes decay in

to be coumpted halfe a diligent Citizein, that beeing content
with the present multitude, hath no regarde to encrease the

very shrowe, and yet not so much therefore (as he is wont to
iest, according to his olde maner) because he might learne
pacience at home, but also because he might not seeme to
come behinde with his duetie, in doing the will of Nature.
For he being a man, such a one (as <emph>Appollo</emph> iudged him by his
Oracle to bee wise) did well perceiue that he was got for this
cause, borne for this cause, and therefore bounde to yeeld so
much vnto Nature.  For, if the olde auncient Philosophers
have said well, if our Diuines haue proued the thing not
without reason, if it be vsed euery where, for a common
Prouerbe, and almost in euery mans mouth, that neither
GOD, nor yet Nature, did euer make any thing in vaine.
Why did he giue vs such members, how happeneth wee haue
such lust, and such power to get issue, if the single life and
none other, bee altogether praise worthie?  If one should
bestowe vpon you a very good thing: as a Bowe, a Coate, or
a Sworde, all men would thinke you were not worthie to
haue the thing, if either you could not, or you would not
vse it and occupie it.  And whereas all other thinges, are
ordeined vpon such great considerations, it is not like that
Nature slipt, or forgat her selfe when she made this one thing.
And now here will some say, that this foule and filthie desire
and stirring vnto lust, came neuer in by Nature, but through
sinne: for whose wordes I passe not a strawe, seeing their
sayinges are as false as God is true.  For I pray you was not
Matrimonie instituted (whose woorke cannot bee done without
these members) before there was no sinne.  And againe,
whence haue all other Beastes their prouocations?  Of Nature,
or of sinne?  A man would thinke they had them of Nature.
But shall I tell you at a worde, wee make that filthie by our
owne immagination, which of the owne Nature is good and
godlie.  Or els if wee will examine matter (not according to
the opinion of men, but waigh them as they are of their owne

<pb n="50"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">50</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

Nature) how chaunceth it, that we thinke it lesse filthie to
eate, to chewe, to disgest, to emptie the bodie, and to sleepe,
then it is to vse carnall Copulation, such as is lawfull and
permitted.  Now sir (you may say) wee must followe vertue,
rather then Nature.  A gentle dish.  As though any thing
can bee called vertue, that is contrary vnto Nature.  Assuredly
there is nothing that can bee perfectly gotte, either through
labour, or through learning, if man grounde not his doinges
altogether vpon Nature.</p>

<p>But you will liue an Apostles life, such as some of them did
that liued single: and exhorted other to the same kinde of life.
Tush, let them followe the Apostles that are Apostles in
deede, whose office seeing it is both to teach, and bring vp
the people in Gods doctrine: they are not able to discharge
their dueties, both to their flocke, and to their wife and
familie: although it is well knowne, that some of the Apostles
had wiues.  But be it that Bishoppes liue single, or graunt we
them to haue no wiues.  What, doe ye followe the profession
of the Apostles, beeing one that is farthest in life from their
vocation: being both a Temporal man, and one that liueth
of your owne.  They had this Pardon graunted them to be
cleane voyd from Mariage, to the end they might bee at
leasure, to get vnto Christ a more plentifull number of his
children.  Let this be the order of Priestes and Monkes, who
belike haue entred into Religion and rule of the <emph>Essens</emph> (such
as among the Iewes lothed Mariage) but your calling is
an other way.  Nay, but (you will say) Christ himself hath
coumpted them blessed, which haue gelded themselues for the
kingdome of God.  Sir, I am content to admit the <reg orig="auctho-ritie">aucthoritie</reg>,
but thus I expound the meaning.  First, I thinke that
this doctrine of Christ, did chiefly belong vnto that time,
when it behoued them chiefly to be voyde of all cares and
businesse of this world.  They were faine to trauaile into all
places, for the persecutors were euer readie to lay hands on
them.  But now the world is so, that a man can find in no
place, the vprightnesse of behauiour lesse strained, then among
married folke.</p>

<p>Let the swarmes of Monkes and Nunnes, set forth their
order neuer so much, let them boast and bragge their bellies
full, of their Ceremonies and Church seruice, wherein they

<pb n="51"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">51</fw>

chiefly passe all other: yet is Wedlocke (beeing well and
truely kept) a most holy kinde of life.  Againe, would to
God they were gelded in very deede, whatsoeuer they bee
that colour their naughtie liuing, with such a ioylie name of
gelding, liuing in much more filthie lust, vnder the cloake and
pretence of Chastitie.  Neither can I reporte for very shame,
into how filthie offences they doe often fall, that will not vse that
remeadie, which Nature hath graunted vnto man.  And last
of all, where doe you reade, that euer Christ commaunded any
man to liue single, and yet he doth openly forbid diuorcement.</p>

<p>Then he doth not worst of all (in my iudgement) for the
Common weale of mankinde, that graunted libertie vnto
Priestes: yea, and Monkes also (if neede bee) to marrie, and to
take them to their wiues, namely, seing there is such an
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Priestes mariage.</note>
vnreasonable number euery where, among whom I pray you,
how many bee there that liue chast.  How much better were
it, to turne their Concubines into wiues, that whereas they
haue them now to their great shame, with an vnquiet
conscience, they might haue the other openly with good
reporte, and get children, and also bring them vp godlie, of
whom they themselues, not onely might not be ashamed, but
also might be compted honest men for them.  And I thinke
the Bishops officers would haue procured this matter long
agoe, if they had not found great gaines by Priestes Lemmans,
then they were like to haue by Priestes wiues.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Virginitie.</note>
But virginitie forsooth is an heauenly thing, it is an Angels
life.  I answere: Wedlocke is a manly thing, such as is meete
for man.  And I talke now as man vnto man.  I graunt
you, that virginitie is a thing praise worthie, but so farre I am
content to speake in praise of it, if it bee not so praised,
as though the iust should altogether followe it.  For if men
commonly should begin to like it, what thing could be
inuented more perilous to a common weale then virginitie?
Now, bee it that other deserue great praise for their <reg orig="maiden-head">maidenhead</reg>,
you notwithstanding cannot want great rebuke, seeing
it lieth in your handes to keepe that house from decay,
wherof your lineally descended, and to continue still the name
of your auncesters, who deserue most worthely to bee knowne
for euer.  And last of all, he deserueth as much praise as they
which keepe their maidenhood: that keepes himselfe true to

his wife, &amp; marieth rather for encrease of children, then to
satisfie his lust.  For if a brother be commaunded to stirre vp
seede to his brother that dieth without issue, will you suffer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
hope of al your stocke to decay: namely, seeing there is none
other of your name and stocke but your self alone, to continue
the posteritie.  I know well enough, that the auncient Fathers
haue set foorth in great volumes the praise of virginitie,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Hieromes praise
vpon Virginitie.</note>
among whom <emph>Hierome</emph> doth so take on, and praiseth it so much
aboue the Starres, that he fell in maner to depraue <reg orig="Matri-monie">Matrimonie</reg>,
and therefore was required of godlie Bishops, to call
backe his words that he had spoken.  But let vs beare with
such heate for that time sake, I would wish now, that they
which exhort young folke euery where, and without respect
(such as yet knowe not themselues) to liue a single life, and to
professe virginitie: that they would bestowe the same labor
in setting forth the discription of chast and pure wedlocke.
And yet those bodies that are in such great loue with
virginitie, are well contented that men should fight against
the Turkes, which in number are infinitely greater then we
are.  And now if these men thinke right in this behalfe, it
must needes be thought right, good, and godly, to labour
earnestly for children getting, and to substitute youth from
time to time for the maintenance of warre.  Except <reg orig="per-aduenture">peraduenture</reg>
they thinke that Gunnes, Billes, Pikes, and Nauies
should be prouided for battaill, and that men stand in no
steede at all with them.  They also allowe it wel, that we
should kill miscreant and Heathen Parents, that the rather
their children not knowing of it, might bee Baptized and
made Christians.  Now if this bee right and lawfull, how
much more gentlenesse were it to haue children baptized,
being born in lawfull mariage.  There is no Nation so
sauage, nor yet so hard harted within the whole worlde, but
the same abhorreth murdering of Inphants, and new borne
babes.  Kings also and head rulers, doe likewise punish most
streightly, all such as seeke meanes to be deliuered before
their time, or vse Phisicke to waxe barraine, and neuer to
beare Children.  What is the reason?  Marie they coumpt it
small difference betwixt him that killeth the childe, so sone
as it beginneth to quicken: &amp; the other that seeketh all meanes
possible, neuer to haue any childe at all.  The self same thing

that either withereth and drieth awaie in the bodie, or els
putrifieth within thee, and so hurteth greatly thy health, yea,
that selfe same which falleth from thee in thy sleepe, would
haue beene a man, if thou thy selfe haddest beene a man.  The
Hebrewes abhorre that man, and wish him Gods cursse, that
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Hebrewes.</note>
(being commaunded to marrie with the wife of his dead brother)
did cast his seede vpon the grounde, least any issue should be
had, and he was euer thought vnworthie to liue here vpon
earth, that would not suffer that childe to liue, which was
quicke in the mothers wombe.  But I praie you, how little
doe they swarue from this offence, which binde them selues to
liue barraine all the daies of their life?  Doe they not seeme to
kill as many men as were like to haue beene borne, if they
had bestowed their endeuours to haue got children?  Now I
pray you, if a man had lande that were very fat and fertile,
and suffered the same for lacke of mannering, for euer to
waxe barraine, should he not, or were he not worthie to be
punished by the Lawes, considering it is for the common
weales behoue, that euery man should well and truely husband
his own.  If that man be punished, who little heedeth the
maintenaunce of his Tillage, the which although it bee neuer
so well mannered, yet it yeeldeth nothing els but Wheate,
Barley, Beanes, and Peason: what punishment is he worthie
to suffer, that refuseth to Plowe that land which being Tilled,
yeeldeth children.  And for plowing lande it is nothing els, but
painfull toyling from time to time: but in getting children
there is a pleasure, which being ordeined as a readie rewarde
for paines taking, asketh a short trauaile for all the Tillage.
Therfore if the working of Nature, if honestie, if vertue, if
inward zeale, if godlinesse, if duetie maie moue you, why can you
not abide that which God hath ordeined, Nature hath established,
reason doth counsaile, Gods worde and mans worde doe <reg orig="com-mende">commende</reg>,
all Lawes doe commende, the consent of all Nations
doth allowe, whereunto also the example of all good men doth
exhort you.  That if euery honest man should desire many thinges
that are most painfull for none other cause, but only for that
they are honest, no doubt but Matrimony ought aboue all
other, most of all to be desired, as the which wee may doubt,
whether it haue more honestie in it, or bring more delight
and pleasure with it.  For what can be more pleasant then to

<pb n="54"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">54</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

liue with her, with whom not onely you shall be ioyned in
fellowship of faithfulnesse, and most heartie good will, but
also you shall be coupled together most assuredly, with the
company of both your bodies: If we count that great pleasure,
which we receiue of the good will of our friends and <reg orig="acquaint-ance">acquaintance</reg>,
how pleasant a thing is it aboue all other to haue one,
with whom you may breake the bottome of your heart, with
whom you may talke as freely as with your self, into whose
trust you may safely commit your self, such a one as thinketh
all your goodes to bee her charge.  Now what an heauenly
blisse (trowe you) is the companie of man and wife together,
seeing that in all the world there can nothing bee found,
either of greater weight &amp; worthines, or els of more strength
and assurance.  For with friends we ioyne onely with them
in good wil, and faithfulnesse of mind, but with a wife we are
matched together, both in heart and mind, in body and soule,
sealed together with the bond &amp; league of an holy sacrament,
and parting all the goods we haue indifferently betwixt vs.
Againe, when other are matched together in friendship, doe
we not see what dissembling they vse, what falshod they
practise, &amp; what deceiptful parts they play?  Yea, euen those
whom we thinke to be most assured friends: as Swalowes flie
away when Sommer is past, so they hide their heads when
fortune gins to faile.  And oft times when wee get a new
frend, we straight forsake our old.  We heare tel of very few
that haue continued friends euen till their last end: whereas
the faithfulnes of a wife is not stained with deceipt, nor
dusked with any dissembling, nor yet parted with any charge
of the world, but disseuered at last by death only, no not by
death neither.  She forsakes and sets light by father &amp; mother,
sister &amp; brother for your sake, and for your loue only.  She
only passeth vpon you, yea, she desires to dye with you.  Haue you
any worldly substaunce?  You haue one that wil maintaine it,
you haue one wil encrease it.  Haue you none?  You haue
a wife that will get it.  If you liue in prosperitie, your ioye is
doubled: if the world goe not with you, you haue a wife to
put you in good comfort, to be at your commaundement, and
readie to serue your desire, and to wish that such euill as hath
happened vnto you, might chaunce vnto her selfe.  And doe



<pb n="55"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">55</fw>

you thinke that any pleasure in all the world is to bee
compared, with such a goodly fellowshippe and familier liuing
together?  If you keepe home, your wife is at hand to keepe
your companie, the rather that you might feele no wearines
of liuing al alone: if you ride forth, you haue a wife to bid
you farewell with a kisse, longing much for you beeing from
home, and glad to bid you welcome home at your next
returne.  A sweete mate in your youth, thankfull comfort in
your age.  Euery societie or companying together is <reg orig="delight-full">delightfull</reg>,
&amp; wished for by Nature of al men, for asmuch as Nature
hath ordeined vs to be sociable, friendly, &amp; louing together.
Now how can this fellowship of man and wife be otherwise
then most pleasaunt, where all things are common together
betwixt them both.  Now I thinke he is most worthie to bee
despised aboue all other, that is borne as a man would say for
himself, that liueth to himself, that seeketh for himself, that
spareth for himself, maketh cost onely vpon himselfe, that
loueth no man, and no man loueth him.  Would not a man
thinke that such a monster, were meete to be cast out of all
mens companie (with  <emph>Tymon</emph> that careth for no man) into the
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Tymon a deadly
hater of all
companie.</note>
middest of the Sea.  Neither doe I here vtter vnto you these
pleasures of the body, the which whereas Nature hath made
to bee most pleasant vnto man, yet these great witted men
rather hide them and dissemble them (I cannot tell how) then
vtterly contemne them.  And yet what is he that is so sower
of witte, and so drouping of braine (I will not say) <reg orig="block-headed">blockheaded</reg>,
or insensate, that is not mooued with such pleasure:
namely, if hee may haue his desire without offence: either of
God or man, and without hinderance of his estimation.
Truly I would take such a one not to be a man, but rather
bee a stone.  Although this pleasure of the body, is the least
part of all those good things that are in wedlocke.  But be it
that you passe not vpon this pleasure, and thinke it vnworthie
for man to vse it, although in deede wee deserue not the name
of man without it, but coumpt it among the least and
vttermost profites that Wedlocke hath.  Now I pray you,
what can bee more hartely desired then chast loue, what can
bee more holie, what can bee more honest?  And among all
these pleasures, you get vnto you a ioyly sort of kinsfolk, in
whom you may take much delite.  You haue other parents,

<pb n="56"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">56</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

other bretherne, sisterne, and nephewes.  Nature in deed can
giue you but one father, and one mother: by Mariage you
get vnto you an other father, and an other mother, who
cannot chuse but loue you with all their hearts, as the which
haue put into your handes, their owne flesh and blood.  Now
againe, what a ioye shall this be vnto you, when your most
faire wife shall make you a Father, in bringing forth a faire
Childe vnto you, where you shall haue a pretie little boye,
running vp and downe your house, such a one as shall expresse
your looke, and your wiues looke, such a one as shall call you
dad with his sweete lipsing wordes.  Now last of all, when
you are thus lincked in Loue, the same shall bee so fastned
and bounde together, as though it were with an Adamant
stone, that Death it selfe can neuer bee able to vndoe it.
Thrise happie are they (quoth <emph>Horace</emph>) yea, more then thrise
happie are they, whom these sure bands doe holde: neither
though they are by euill reporters full oft set asunder, shall
Loue bee vnlosed betwixt them two, till Death them both
depart.  You haue them that shall comfort you in your latter
daies, that shall close vp your eyes when God shall call you,
that shall burie you, and fulfill all thinges belonging to your
Funerall, by whom you shall seeme to bee newe borne.  For
so long as they shall liue, you will neuer bee thought dead
your selfe.  The goodes and lands that you haue got, goe not
to other heires then to your owne.  So that vnto such as
haue fulfilled all thinges, that belong vnto mans life, Death it
selfe cannot seeme better.  Old age commeth vpon vs al, will
we, or nill we, and this way Nature prouided for vs, that we
should waxe yong again in our children &amp; nephewes.  For
what man can be greeued that he is old, when he seeth his
owne countenance, which he had being a childe, to appeare
liuely in his sonne?  Death is ordained for all mankind, &amp; yet
by this meanes only, Nature by her prouidence, mindeth vnto
vs a certain immortalitie, while she encreaseth one thing
vpon an other, euen as a yong graffe buddeth out, when the
old Tree is cut doune.  Neither can he seeme to dye, that
when God calleth him, leaueth a yong childe behind him.
But I know well enough, what you say to your self al this
while of my long talke.  Mariage is an happie thing, if all
thinges hap well, what if one haue a curst wife?  What if she



<pb n="57"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">57</fw>

be light?  What if his children bee vngracious?  Thus I see you
remember all such men, as by Mariage haue beene vndone.
Well, goe to it, tell as many as you can, and spare not: you
shall finde all these were the faults of the persons, and not the
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Euill wiues happen
to euil men only.</note>
faultes of Marriage.  For beleeue me, none haue euill wiues,
but such as are euill men.  And as for you sir, you may chuse
a good wife if you list.  But what if she bee crooked and
mard altogether, for lacke of good ordering.  A good honest
wife, may be made an euill woman by a naughtie husband, and
an euill wife hath beene made a good woman, by an honest
man.  Wee crye out of wiues vntruely, and accuse them
without cause.  There is no man (if you will beleeue me) that
euer had an euill wife, but through his owne default.  Now
againe, an honest Father, bringeth forth honest children, like
vnto himselfe.  Although euen these children, howsoeuer
they are borne, commonly become such men, as their <reg orig="educa-tion">education</reg>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Ielousie <reg orig="vn-knowne">vnknowne</reg>

and bringing vp is.  And as for Ielousie, you shall not
neede to feare that fault at all.  For none bee troubled with
such a disease but those only that are foolish Louers.  Chast,
godlie, and lawfull loue, neuer knewe what Ielousie ment.
What meane you to call to your minde, and remember such
sore Tragedies, and dolefull dealinges, as haue beene betwixt
man and wife.  Such a woman beeing naught of her bodie,
hath caused her husband to lose his head: an other haue
poysoned her good man, the third with her churlish dealing
(which her husband could not beare) hath beene his vtter

<emph>Graccus?</emph>  Why doe ye not minde that most worthie wife, or

husbands, could not bee chaunged, no not by death.  A good

all the world.  Well then sir, imagine your selfe worthie to
haue a rare wife, such as fewe man haue.  A good woman
(saith the wiseman) is a good portion.  Be you bold to hope
for such a one, as is worthie your maners.  The chiefest
point standeth in this, what maner of woman you chuse,
how you vse her, how you order your selfe towards her.
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Prouer. x.</note>
But libertie (you will say) is much more pleasaunt: for
whosoeuer is married, weareth fetters vpon his legges, or
rather carieth a clog, the which he can neuer shake of, till
Death part their yoke.  To this I aunswer, I cannot see what
pleasure a man shall haue, to liue alone.  For if libertie bee
delightfull, I would thinke you should get a mate vnto you,
with whom you should part stakes, and make her priuie of
all your ioyes.  Neither can I see any thing more free, then
is the seruitude of these two, where the one is so much
beholding and bound to the other, that neither of them both
would be lose though they might.  You are bound vnto him,
whom you receiue into your friendship: but in Marriage
neither partie findeth fault, that their libertie is taken away
from them.  Yet once againe you are sore afraied, least when
your children are taken away by death, you fall to mourning
for want of issue.  Well sir, if you feare lack of issue, you
must marie a wife for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> self same purpose, the which only
shalbe a meane, that you shal not want issue.  But what doe
you search so diligently, nay so carefully, all the <reg orig="incom-modities">incommodities</reg>
of Matrimonie, as though single life had neuer any
incommoditie ioyned with it at all.  As though there were
any kinde of life in al the world, that is not subiect to al
euils that may happen.  He must needes goe out of this
world, that lookes to liue without feeling of any greefe.
And in comparison of that life, which the Saincts of God shall
haue in heauen, this life of man is to bee coumpted a death,
and not a life.  But if you consider things within the
compasse of mankinde, there is nothing either more safe,
more quiet, more pleasaunt, more to be desired, or more
happie then is the married mans life.  How many doe you
see, that hauing once felt the sweetnesse of Wedlocke, doth
not desire eftsones to enter into the same?  My friend
<emph>Mauricius</emph>, whom you knowe to be a very wiseman, did not he
the next Moneth after his wife died (whom he loued dearely)

<pb n="59"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">59</fw>

get him straight a newe wife?  Not that he was impacient of
his lust, and could not forbeare any longer, but hee saied
plainly, it was no life for him to be without a wife, which
should bee with him as his yokefellowe, and companion in all
things.  And is not this the fourth wife that our friend
<emph>Iouius</emph> hath maried?  And yet he so loued the other when
they were on liue, that none was able to comfort him in his
heauinesse: And now he hastened so much (when one was
dead) to fill vp and supplie the voyde roume of his Chamber,
as though he had loued the other very little.  But what doe
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Necessitie enforceth
Mariage.</note>
we talke so much of the honestie and pleasure herein, seeing
that not onely profite doth aduise vs, but also neede doth
earnestly force vs to seeke marriage.  Let it bee forbidden
that man and woman shall not come together, and within
fewe yeares all mankinde must needes decay for euer.  When
<emph>Xerxes</emph> King of the <emph>Persians</emph>, beheld from an high place that
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Xerxes.</note>
great Armie of his, such as almost was incredible: Some
saied he could not forbeare weeping, considering of so many
thousands, there was not one like to bee aliue within seuentie
yeares after.  Now, why should not wee consider the same
of all mankinde, which he ment only of his armie.  Take
away mariage, and how many shall remaine after a hundred
yeares, of so many Realmes, Countries, Kingdomes, Cities,
&amp; all other assemblies that be of men throughout the whole
world?  On now, praise we a Gods name, the single life aboue
the Rocke, the which is like for euer to vndoe all mankinde.
What Plague, what infection can either Heauen or Hell,
sende more harmefull vnto mankinde?  What greater euil
is to be feared by any flood?  What could bee looked for more
sorowfull, although the flame of  <emph>Phaeton</emph> should set the world
on fire againe?  And yet by such sore tempestes, many thinges
haue beene saued harmelesse, but by the single life of man,
there can be nothing left at al.  We see what a sort of
diseases, what diuersitie of mishappes doe night and day lye
in wait, to lessen the small number of mankind.  How
many doth the Plague destroye, how many doe the Seas
swallowe, how many doth Battaile snatch vp?  For I will not
speake of the daylie dying that is in all places.  Death
taketh her flight euery where rounde about, she runneth ouer
them, she catcheth them vp, she hasteneth as much as she

<pb n="60"/>

can possible to destroye all mankinde: and now doe we
so highly commend single life, and eschue Mariage?  Except
happelie we like the profession of the <emph>Essens</emph> (of whom <emph>Iosephus</emph>
speaketh, that they will neither haue wife nor seruauntes) or
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Essens hated

<emph>Iosephus 18.</emph>
<emph>Cap. lib. 12.</emph></note>
the <emph>Dolopolitans</emph>, called otherwise the rascalles and slaues of
Cities, the which companie of them is alwaie encreased,
&amp; continued by a sort of vagabond peasants that continue,
and bee from time to time still together.  Doe wee looke
that some  <emph>Iupiter</emph> should giue vs that same gift, the which he
is reported to haue giuen vnto Bees, that he should haue
issue without procreation, and gather with our mouthes out
of the flowers, the seede of our posteritie?  Or els doe wee
desire, that like as the Poets feine <emph>Minerua</emph>, to be borne out
of <emph>Iupiters</emph> head: in like sort there should children leape out
of our heads?  Or last of all doe wee looke, according as the
old Fables haue bene, that men should be borne out of the
earth, out of Rockes, out of stocks, stones, and old Trees.
Many things breed out of the earth, without mans labour at
all.  Young shrubbes growe and shoute vp, vnder the shadowe
of their graunsire Trees.  But Nature would haue man to
vse his owne waye of encreasing issue, that through labour
of both the Husbande and wife, mankinde might still bee
kept from destruction.  But I promise you, if all men tooke
after you, and still forbeare to marie: I cannot see but that
these things which you wonder at, and esteeme so much,
could not haue beene at all.  Doe you yet esteeme this single
life so greatly?  Or doe wee praise so much virginitie aboue
all other?  Why man, there will bee neither single men, nor
Virgines aliue, if men leaue to marrie, and minde not
procreation.  Why doe you then preferre virginitie so much,
why set it you so hye, if it bee the vndoing of all the whole
world?  It hath beene much commended, but it was for that
time, and in fewe.  God would haue men to see, as though
it were a patterne, or rather a picture of the heauenly
habitation, where neither any man shall be married, nor yet
any shall giue theirs to Marriage.  But when thinges bee
giuen for example a fewe may suffice, a number were to no
purpose.  For euen as all groundes, though they be very
fruitfull, are not therefore turned into tillage for mans vse
and commoditie, but part lieth fallowe, and is neuer

<pb n="61"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">61</fw>

mannered, part is kept &amp; cherished to like the eye, and for
mans pleasure: And yet in all the plentie of thinges, where
so great store of Land is, Nature suffereth very little to waxe
barren: but now if none should be tilled, &amp; Plowmen went
to play, who seeth not but that we should all starue, and bee
faine shortly to eate Acornes: euen so it is praise worthie, if
a fewe liue single, but if all should seeke to liue single, so
many as be in this world, it were too great an inconuenience.
Now againe, be it that other deserue worthy praise that
seeke to liue a virgins life, yet it must nedes be a great fault
in you.  Other shalbe thought to seke a purenesse of life,
you shalbe coumpted a  <emph>Parricide</emph>, or a murtherer of your
stocke, that whereas you may by honest Mariage, encrease
your posteritie: you suffer it to decay for euer through your
wilfull single life.  A man may hauing an house full of
children, commend one to God to liue a virgin all his life.
The plowman offereth to God the tenthes of his owne, and
not his whole Crop altogether: but you sir, must remember
that there is none left aliue of all your stocke, but your self
alone.  And now it mattereth nothing whether you kill, or
refuse to saue that creature, which you onely might saue and
that with ease.  But you will followe the example of your
sister, and liue single as she doth.  And yet me thinketh you
should chiefly, euen for this selfe same cause bee afraied to
liue single.  For whereas there was hope of issue heretofore
in you both, now you see there is no hope left but in you
only.  Bee it that your sister may bee borne withall, because
she is a woman, and because of her yeares: for she being but
a gerle, and ouercome with sorrowe for losse of her Mother,
tooke the wrong way, she cast her selfe doune headlong
&amp; became a Nunne, at the earnest sute either of foolish
women, or els of doltish Monkes: but you beeing much
elder, must euermore remember that you are a man: She
would needes dye together with her auncesters, you must
labour that your auncesters shall not dye at all.  Your Sister

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Daughters
of Loth.</note>
would not doe her duetie, but shrinke away: thinke you now
with your self, that you haue two offices to discharge.  The
daughters of Loth neuer stucke at the matter, to haue
adoe with their dronken Father, thinking it better with
wicked Whoredome and Incest, to prouide for their posteritie,

<pb n="62"/>

then to suffer their stocke to dye for euer.  And will not you
with honest, godlie, and chast Marriage (which shall bee
without trouble, and turne to your great pleasure) haue
a regarde to your posteritie, most like els for euer to decay?
Therefore, let them on Gods name, followe the purpose of
chast <emph>Hippolitus</emph>, let them liue a single life that either can be
maried men, and yet can get no children, or els such whose
stocke may bee continued, by meanes of other their kinsfolke,
or at the least whose kindered is such, that it were better for
the Common weale they were all dead, then any of that
name should be a liue, or els such men as the euerliuing God
of his most especiall goodnesse hath chosen out of the whole
world, to execute some heauenly office, whereof there is a

troubles, as in commen miseries.  As in losse of goods, in
lacke of freendes, in sicknesse, in darth, and in death.  In all
which losses, the wise vse so to comfort the weake, that they
giue them not iust cause euen at the first, to refuse all
comforte.  And therefore, they vse two waies of cherishing
the troubled mindes.  The one is, when we shewe that in
<note place="marg" anchored="yes"> <reg orig="Comfort-ing">Comforting</reg> two
waies vsed.</note>
some cases, and for some causes, either they should not
lament at all, or els be sorie very little: the other is when we
graunt that they haue iust cause to be sad, and therefore we
are sad also in their behalfe, and would remedie the mater if it
could be, and thus entering into felowship of sorowe, we
seeke by a little and litle to mitigate their greefe.  For all
extreme heauinesse, and vehement sorowes can not abide
comfort, but rather seeke a mourner that would take parte
with them.  Therefore, much warinesse ought to be vsed,

<pb n="66"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">66</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

when we happen vpon such exceeding sorowfulnesse, least we
rather purchase hatred, then asswage griefe.</p>

<p>Those harmes should be moderatly borne, which must
needes happen to euery one, that haue chaunced to any one.
As Death, which spareth none, neither King nor Keisar, neither
poore nor riche.  Therefore, to be impacient for the losse of
our frends, is to fall out with God, because he made vs men
and not Angels.  But the Godly (I trust) will alwaies remit
the order of things, to the will of God, and force their
passions to obeie necessitie.  When God lately visited this
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Sweating disease.</note>
Realme with the Sweating disease, and receiued the two
worthie Gentlemen, Henry Duke of Suffolk, and his brother
Lord Charles: I seeing my Ladies Grace, their mother,
taking their death most greeuously, could not otherwise for
the duetie which I then did, and euer shall owe vnto her, but
comfort her in that her heauinesse, the which vndoubtedly at
that tyme much weakened her bodie.  And because it may
serue for an example of comfort, I haue bene bolde to set it
foorth, as it foloweth hereafter.</p>

<div3 type="para"><head>An example of comfort.</head>
<p>THough mine enterprise may bee thought foolish, and my
doinges very slender, in busying my braine to teache the
expert, to giue counsaile to other, when I lacke it my selfe,
and whereas more neede were for me to be taught of other,
to take vpon mee to teache my betters, yet duetie binding me
to doe my best, and among a number, though I can doe least,
yet good will setting me forth with the formost: I can not
chuse but write what I am able, and speake what I can
possible, for the better comforting of your Grace, in this your
great heauinesse, and sore visitation sent from GOD, as
a warning to vs all.  The Phisition then deserueth most
thankes, when he practiseth his knowledge in time of
necessitie, and then trauaileth most painefully, when hee feeleth
his Pacient to bee in most daunger.  The souldiour at that
time, and at no time so much, is thought most trustie when
hee sheweth at a neede his faithfull heart, and in time of
extreme daunger doth vse, &amp; bestow his most earnest labour.
In the wealth of this worlde, what valiaunt man can want
assistence?  What mightie Prince can misse any helpe to
compasse his desire?  Who lacketh men, that lacketh no

money?  But when God striketh the mightie with his strong
hande, and displaceth those that were highly placed: what
one man doeth once looke backe, for the better easement of
his deare brother, and Godly comforting his euen Christen,
in the chiefe of all his sorowe.  All men commonly more
reioyce in the Sunne rising, then they doe in the Sunne
setting.  The hope of lucre and expectation of priuate gaine,
maketh many one to beare out a countenaunce of fauour,
whose heart is inwardly fretted with dedly rancour.  But
such frendes euen as prosperitie doeth get them, so aduersitie
doth trie them.  God is the searcher of euery mans thought,
vnto whose iudgement, I deferre the assuraunce of my good
will.</p>

<p>And though I can doe little, and therefore deserue as little
thanke, as I loke for praise (which is none at all) yet will
I endeuour earnestly at all times, as well for mine owne
discharge, to declare my duetie, as at this present to say
somewhat, for the better easement of your Grace in this your
<note place="marg" anchored="yes"> Passions work

heauines.  The passions of the minde haue diuers effectes,
and therefore worke straungely, according to their properties.
For, like as ioye comforteth the heart, nourisheth bloud, and
quickeneth the whole bodie: So heauinesse and care hinder
digestion, ingender euill humours, waste the principall partes,
and with time consume the whole bodie.  For the better
knowledge therof, &amp; for a liuely sight of the same, we
neede not to seeke farre for any example, but euen to come
straight vnto your Grase, whose bodie as I vnderstand
credibly, and partly see my selfe, is sore appaired within
short time, your minde so troubled, and your hart so heauie,
that you hate in a maner all light, you like not the sight of
any thing, that might bee your comfort, but altogether
striken in a dumpe, you seeke to be solitarie, detesting all ioy,
and delyting in sorrowe, wish with harte (if it were Gods
will) to make your last ende.  In which your heauinesse, as
I desire to be a comforter of your Grace, so I can not blame
your naturall sorowe, if that now after declaration of the
same, you would moderate all your griefe hereafter, and call
backe your pensiuenesse, to the prescript order of reason.</p>

<p>And first, for the better remedie of euery disease, and
troubled passions, it is best to knowe the principall cause and

<pb n="68"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">68</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

chiefe occasion of the same.  Your Grace had two sonnes,
how noble, howe wittie, how learned, and how Godly, many
thousands better knowe it, then any one is able well to tell
it.  GOD at his pleasure hath taken them both to his mercie,
and placed them with him, which were surely ouer good to
tarie here with vs.  They both died as your Grace knoweth
very yong, which by course of Nature and by mans estimation,
might haue liued much longer.  They both were together in
one house, lodged in two seuerall Chambers, and almost at
one time both sickened, and both departed.  They died both
Dukes, both well learned, both wise, and both right Godly.
They both gaue straunge tokens of death to come.  The
Elder sitting at Supper and very merie, sayd sodainly to that
right honest Matrone, and Godly Gentlewoman, that most
faithfull and long assured seruaunt of yours, whose life God
graunt long to continue: O Lorde, where shall we suppe to
morowe at night, whereupon she being troubled, and yet
saying comfortably, I trust my Lorde, either here, or els
where at some of your freends houses: Nay (quoth he) we
shal neuer Suppe together againe in this worlde be you well
assured, and with that, seeing the Gentlewoman discomfited,
turned it vnto mirth, and passed the rest of his Supper with
much ioye, and the same night after twelue of the Clocke,
being the fowerteene of Iulie sickned, and so was taken the
next morning, about seauen of the clocke, to the mercie of
God, in the yere of our Lorde, a thousande fiue hundred fiftie
and one.  When the eldest was gone, the younger would not
tarie, but tolde before (hauing no knowledge thereof by any
bodie liuing) of his brothers death, to the greate wondering
of all that were there, declaring what it was to lose so deare
a freend, but comforting himselfe in that passion, said: well,
my brother is gone, but it maketh no matter for I will goe
straight after him, and so did within the space of halfe an
hower, as your Grace can best tell which was there present.

Nowe I renewe these wordes to your Graces knowledge, that
you might the more stedfastly consider their time, to be then
appointed of GOD, to forsake this euill worlde, and to liue
with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob in the kingdome of Heauen.
But wherefore did GOD take two such awaie, and at that
time?  Surely, to tell the principall cause, wee may by all

<pb n="69"/>

<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">69</fw>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">The cause why God

most worthiest.</note>
likenesse affirme, that they were taken away from vs for our
wretched sinnes, and most vile naughtinesse of life, that
thereby wee being warned, might be as ready for God, as
they now presently were, and amend our liues in time, whom
God will call, what time wee know not.  Then as I can see,
we haue small cause to lament the lacke of them, which are in
such blessed state, but rather to amend our owne liuing, to
forthinke vs of our offences, and to wish of God to purge our
hearts from all filthines and vngodly dealing, that we may be
(as they now be) blessed with God for euer.  Notwithstanding,
the workes of God are vnsearchable, without the compasse of
mans braine, precisely to comprehend the very cause, sauing
that this perswasion ought surely to bee grounded in vs,
euermore to thinke that God is offended with sinne, and that
hee punisheth offences, to the third and fowerth generation,
of all them that breake his commaundements, beeing iust in all
his workes, and doing all things for the best.  And therefore,
when God plagueth in such sorte, I would wish that our faith
might alwaies be staied, vpon the admiration of Gods glorie
through out all his doings, in whom is none euill, neither yet
was there euer any guile found.  And I doubt not, but your
Grace is thus affected, and vnfainedly confessing your owne
offences, taketh this scourge to come from God, as a iust
punishment of sinne for the amendement, not onely of your
owne selfe, but also for the amendement of al other in
generall.  The lamentable voyce of the poore (which is the
mouth of God) throughout the whole realme declares full well,
the wickednesse of this life, and shewes plainly that this euill
is more generally felt, then any man is able by worde, or by
writing at full to set forth.</p>

<p>When God therefore, that is Lorde, not onely of the riche
but also of the poore, seeth his ground spoyled from the
wholsome profite of many, to the vaine pleasure of a fewe,
and the yearth made priuate, to suffice the lust of vnsaciable
couetousnesse, and that those which be his true members, can
not liue for the intollerable oppression, the sore enhaunsing,
and the most wicked grasing of those throughout the whole
Realme, which otherwise might well liue with the onely value
and somme of their landes, and yerely reuenues: he striketh
in his anger the innocentes and tender younglings to plague

<pb n="70"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">70</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

vs with the lacke of them, whose innocencie, and Godlinesse
of life, might haue been a iust example for vs, to amende our
most euill doings.  In which wonderfull worke of GOD,
when hee receiued these two most noble impes, and his
children elected to the euerlasting Kingdome, I can not but
magnifie his most glorious name, from time to time, that
hath so graciously preserued these two worthy Gentlemen,
from the daunger of further euill, and most vile wretchednesse
most like right shortly to ensue, except we all repent, and
forethinke vs of our former euill liuing.  And yet I speake
not this as though I knewe any crime to bee more in you,
then in any other: But I tel it to the shame of al those
vniuersally within this Realme, that are giltie of such offences,
whose inward consciences condemne their owne doings, and
their open deedes beare witnesse against their euill nature.
For it is not one house that shall feele the fall of these two
Princes, neither hath God taken them for one priuate persons
offences: but for the wickednesse of the whole Realme, which
is like to feele the smarte, except God be mercifull vnto vs.</p>

<p>But now that they be gone, though the flesh be fraile,
weake, and tender, and must needes smart, being wounded or
cut: yet I doubt not but your grace, lacking two such
portions of your owne flesh, and hauing them (as a man
would say) cut away from your owne body, will suffer the
smart with a good stomacke, and remember that sorowe is but
an euill remedy to heale a sore.  For if your hand were
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Where <reg orig="ne-cessitie">necessitie</reg>
ruleth, sorowe is
needelesse.</note>
detrenched, or your bodie maymed with some sodaine stroke,
what profite were it for you to weepe vpon your wound, and
when the harme is done, to lament stil the sore?  Seing that
with weeping it will not be lesse, &amp; may yet through weeping
ful sone be made more.  For the sore is increased, when
sorowe is added, and the paine is made double, which before
was but single.  A constaunt Christian should beare all
miserie, and with pacience abide the force of necessitie,
shewing with sufferaunce the strength of his faith, and
especially when the change is from euill to good, from woe to
weale, what folly is it to sorrowe that, for the which they
ioye that are departed?  They haue taken now their rest, that
liued here in trauaile: They haue forsaken their bodies,
wherin they were bound to receiue the spirit, whereby they



<pb n="71"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">71</fw>

are free.  They haue chosen for sicknesse, health: for earth,
heauen: for life transitorie, life immortall: and for man,
God: then the which, what can they haue more?  Or how is
it possible they can be better?  Vndoubtedly if euer they were
happie, they are now most happie: if euer they were well,
they are now in best case, being deliuered from this present
euill worlde, and exempted from Sathan, to liue for euer with
Christe our Sauiour.</p>

<p>Then what meane wee, that not onely lament the want of
other, but also desire to tarie here our selues, hoping for
a short vaine, and therewith a painefull pleasure, and refusing
to enioye that continuall perfect, and heauenly enheritaunce,
the which so sone shall happen vnto us, as Nature dissolueth
this earthly body.  Trueth it is, we are more fleshly then
spirituall, soner feeling the ache of our body, then the greefe
of our soule: more studious with care to be healthfull in
carkasse, then seeking with praier, to bee pure in spirite.
And therefore, if our freendes bee stained with sinne, we doe not
or we will not espie their sore, we coumpt them faultlesse, when
they are most wicked, neither seking the redresse of their euill
doing, nor yet once amending the faultes of our owne liuing.</p>

<p>But when our freend departeth this world, and then
forsaketh vs, when sinne forsaketh him: we begin to shewe
our fleshly natures, wee weepe and we waile, and with long
sorrowe without discretion, declare our want of Gods grace,
and all goodnesse.  Whereas we see that as some be borne,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">The folly of such
as sorrow the want
of their freendes.</note>
some doe die also, men, women and children, and not one
hower certaine to vs of all our life, yet we neuer mourne, we
neuer weepe, neither marking the death of such as we knowe,
nor regarding the euill life of those whom we loue.  But
when such depart as were either nighest of our kinred, or els
most our freendes, we then lament without all comfort, not
the sinnes of their soules, but the chaunge of their bodies,
leauing to doe that which we should, and doing that only
which we should not doe at all.  Wherein not onely wee
declare much want of faith, but also wee shewe greate lacke of
witte.  For as the other are gone before, either to heauen or
els to Hell: so shall our freends and kinsfolke folowe after.
We are all made of one mettall, and ordeined to dye so many
as liue.  Therefore what folly is it in vs, or rather what

<pb n="72"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">72</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

fleshly madnesse immoderately to wayle their death, whom
GOD hath ordeined to make their ende, except we lament
the lacke of our owne liuing? For euen as well wee might at
their first birthe bewaile their natiuitie, considering they must
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Death common
to all.</note>
needes die, because they are borne to liue.  And whatsoeuer
hath a beginning, the same hath also an ending, and the ende
is not at our will, which desire continuaunce of life, but at
his will which gaue the beginning of life.  Now then seeing
GOD hath ordeined all to dye, according to his appointed
will, what meane they that would haue theirs to liue?  Shall
God alter his first purpose, for the onely satisfying of our
foolish pleasure?  And where GOD hath minded that the whole
worlde shall decaie, shall any man desire that any one house
may stande?  In my minde, there can be no greater comfort to
any one liuing for the lacke of his freend, then to thinke that
this happened to him, which all other either haue felt, or els
shall feele hereafter: And that God the rather made Death
common to all, that the vniuersall Plague and egalnesse to all,
might abate the fiercenesse of death, and comfort vs in the
crueltie of the same, considering no one man hath an ende, but
that all shall haue the like, and die we must euery mothers
sonne of vs at one time or other.  But you will say: my
children might haue liued longer, they died young.  Sure it
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Euill to liue
among the euill.</note>
is by mans estimation they might haue liued longer, but had
it bene best for them thinke you, to haue continued still in
this wretched worlde, where Vice beareth rule, and Vertue is
subdued, where GOD is neglected, his lawes not obserued,
his word abused, and his Prophetes that preach the iudgement
of God, almost euery where contemned?  If your children
were a liue, and by the aduise of some wicked person, were
brought to a Brothell house, where entising Harlots liued, and
so were in daunger to commit that foule sinne of whoredome,
and so led from one wickednesse to another: I am assured,
your grace would call them backe with labour, and would
with exhortations induce them to the feare of God, and vtter
detestation of all sinne, as you haue ful often heretofore done,
rather fearing euil to come, then knowing any open fault to
be in either of them.  Now then seeing God hath done the
same for you himselfe, that you would haue done for them if
they had liued, that is, in deliuering them both from this

a Brothell house, and a life of all naughtinesse: you ought to
thanke God highly, that he hath taken awaie your two sonnes,
euen in their youth, being innocentes both for their liuing,
and of such expectation for their towardnesse, that almost it
were not possible for them hereafter, to satisfie the hope in
their age, which al men presently had conceiued of their
youth.  It is thought and in deede it is no lesse then a great
point of happinesse, to dye happely.  Now, when could your
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">To die happely,

two noble Gentlemen haue died better, then when they were
at the best, most Godly in many things, offending in fewe,
beloued of the honest, and hated of none (if euer they were
hated) but of such as hate the best.  As in deede, noble
vertue neuer wanted cankard enuie to followe her.  And
considering that this life is so wretched, that the best are euer
most hated, and the vilest alwaies most esteemed, and your
two Sonnes of the other side, being in that state of honestie,
and trained in that path of godlinesse (as I am able to be
a liuely witnesse, none hath bene like these many yeres, or at
the least, none better brought vp) what thinke you of God,
did he enuie them, or els did he prouidently forsee vnto them
both, when he tooke them both from vs.  Assuredly, whom
God loueth best, those he taketh sonest, according to the saying
of Salomon: The righteous man (meaning Enoch, and other
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Wised. iiii.</note>
the chosen of God) is sodainly taken away, to the intent, that
wickednesse should not alter his vnderstanding, and that
hypocrisie should not begile his soule.  For the craftie
bewitching of lyes, make good things darke: the <reg orig="vnstedfast-nesse">vnstedfastnesse</reg>
also, and wickednesse of volupteous desire, turne aside
the vnderstanding of the simple.  And though the righteous
was sone gone, yet fulfilled he much time, for his soule pleased
God, and therefore hasted he to take him awaie from among the

wicked.  Yea, the good men of God in all ages, haue euer
had an earnest desire to be dissolued.  My soule (quoth
Dauid) hath an earnest desire to enter into the courtes of the
Lord.  Yea, like as the Hart desireth the water brookes, so
longeth my soule after thee O God.  My soule is a thirst for
God: yea, euen for the liuing God, when shall I come to
appeare before the presence of God?  Paule &amp; the Apostles

day a thousand yere, till their soules were parted from their
bodies.  Then what should we waile them, which are in that
place where we al should wish to be, and seeke so to liue, that
we might be ready, when it shall please God of his goodnesse
to cal vs to his mercy.  Let us be sicke for our own sinnes
that liue here on earth, and reioyce in their most happie
passage, that are gone to heauen.  Thei haue not left vs, but

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Life, the right
way to death.
Death <reg orig="pur-chaseth">purchaseth</reg>
rest.</note>
gone before vs to inherite with Christ, their kingdom
prepared.  And what should this greue your grace that thei
are gone before, considering our whole life is nothing els but
the right waie to death.  Should it trouble any one, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his
frend is come to his iourneis end?  Our life is nothing els,
but a continuall trauaile, &amp; death obtaineth rest after all our
labor.  Among men that trauaile by the hye waie, he is best
at ease (in my minde) that sonest cometh to his iourneis end.
Therefore, if your grace loued your children (as I am well
assured you did) you must reioyce in their rest, and giue God
hartie thanks, that they are come so sone to their iourneis
ende.  Mary, if it were so that man might escape the daunger
of death, &amp; liue euer, it were an other matter: but because

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Death more frendly,
the soner it commeth.</note>
we must al die, either first or last, &amp; nothing so sure in this
life, as we are al sure to die at length, &amp; nothing more
vncertaine vnto man, then the certaine time of euery mans
latter time, what forceth when we die, either this daie or
to morowe, either this yere or the next, sauing that I thinke
them most happie that dye sonest, and Death frendly to none
so much, as to them whom she taketh sonest.  At the time of

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Thracians.</note>
an Execution done, for greuous offences, what mattereth who
die first, when a dosen are condemned together by a Lawe,
considering they must all die one and other.  I saie still,
happie are they that are sonest ridde out of this world, and
the soner gone, the soner blessed.  The <emph>Thracians</emph> lament

greatly at the birth of their children, and reioyce much at the

nothing els but miserie, and the world to come ioye for euer.
Nowe againe the childe now borne, partly declareth the state
of this life, who beginneth his time with wayling, and first
sheweth teares, before he can iudge the cause of his woe.  If
we beleeue the promises of God, if wee hope for the generall
resurrection, and constantly affirme that God is iust in all his

workes: we can not but ioyfully say with the iust man Iob.
The Lorde gaue them, the Lorde hath taken them againe,
as it pleased God so may it be, and blessed be the name of the
Lord for now &amp; euer.  God dealeth wrongfully with no man,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Iob.</note>
but extendeth his mercie most plentifully ouer all mankind.
God gaue you two children, as the like I haue not knowden,
happie are you most gracious Ladie that euer you bare them.
God lent you them two for a time, and tooke them two againe
at his time, you haue no wrong done you, that he hath taken
them: but you haue receiued a wonderfull benefite that euer
you had them.  He is very vniust that boroweth and will not
paie againe but at his pleasure.  He forgetteth much his
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Lent goods must
restored at the
owners will.</note>
duetie, that boroweth a Iewell of the Kings Maiestie, and will
not restore it with good will, when it shall please his Grace to
cal for it.  He is vnworthie hereafter to borowe, that will
rather grudge because he hath it no longer, then once giue
thanks because he hath had the vse of it so long.  He is ouer
couetous, that coumpteth not gainefull the time of his borowing:
but iudgeth it losse to restore things againe.  He is <reg orig="vnthank-full">vnthankfull</reg>
that thinkes hee hath wrong done, when his pleasure is
shortned, and takes the ende of his delight to be extreme
euill.  He loseth the greatest part of his ioye in this worlde,
that thinketh there is no pleasure but of thinges present: that
can not comfort himselfe with pleasure past, and iudge them
to be most assured, considering the memorie of them once
had, can neuer decaie.  His ioyes bee ouer straight, that bee
comprehended within the compasse of his sight, and thinketh
nothing comfortable, but that which is euer before his eyes.
All pleasure, which man hath in this worlde, is very shorte,
and sone goeth it waie, the remembrance lasteth euer and
is much more assured, then is the presence or liuely sight of
any thing.  And thus your Grace may euer reioyce, that you
had two such, which liued so verteously, and dyed so Godly,
and though their bodies bee absent from your sight, yet the
remembraunce of their vertues, shall neuer decaie from your
mind.  God lendeth life to all, and lendeth at his pleasure
for a time.  To this man he graunteth a long life, to this
a short space, to some one, a daie, to some a yere, to some
a moneth.  Now, when GOD taketh, what man should be
offended, considering he that gaue freely, may boldly take his

<pb n="76"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">76</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

owne when he will, and doe no man wrong. The Kings
Maiestie giueth one .x. li. an other .xl. li. an other .lx. li.
shal he be greeued that receiued but, x. li. and not rather
giue thankes, that he receiued so much?  Is that man happier
that dieth in the latter ende of the moneth, then hee is that
dyed in the beginning of the same moneth?  Doeth distaunce
of time, and long tarying from God, make men more happie
when they come to God?  By space of passage we differ much,
and one liueth longer than an other, but by death at the last
we all are matched, and none the happier that liueth the
longer: but rather most happie is he that died the sonest,
and departed best in the faith of Christ.  Thinke therefore
your selfe most happie, that you had two such, and giue God
hartie thankes that it pleased him so soone to take two such.
Necessitie is lawlesse, and that which is by God appointed, no
man can alter.  Reioyce we, or weepe we, dye we shall, how
soone no man can tell.  Yea, we are all our life time warned
before, that death is at hande, and that when we goe to bed,
we are not assured to rise the next day in the morning, no,
not to liue one hower longer.  And yet to see our folly, we
would assigne God his tyme, according to our sacietie, and
not content our selues with his doings, according to his
appointment.  And euer wee saie when any die yong, he
might haue liued longer, it was pitie he died so sone.  As
though forsoth, he were not better with God, then he can be
with man.  Therefore, whereas for a time your Grace much
bewailed their lacke, not onely absenting your selfe from all
companie, but also refusing all kind of comforte, almost dead
with heauinesse, your bodie being so worne with sorrowe, that
the long continuaunce of the same, is much like to shorten
your daies: I will desire your Grace for Gods loue, to referre
your wil to God's will, and whereas hetherto nature hath
taught you, to weepe the lacke of your naturall children, let
reason teach you hereafter to wype awaie the teares, and let
not phantasie encrease that, which nature hath commaunded
moderatly to vse.  To be sory for the lack of our dearest,
we are taught by nature, to be ouercome with sorow, it
commeth of our owne fonde opinion, and great folly it is,
with natural sorowe to encrease al sorowe, and with a little
sicknesse, to purchase readie death.  The sorowes of brute

<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">77</fw>

beastes are sharpe, and yet they are but short.  The Cowe
lacking her Caulf, leaueth lowing within three or fower daies
at the farthest.  Birds of the Aire, perceyuing their young
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">The nature of
brute beastes.</note>
ones taken from their neast, chitter for a while in Trees
there about, and straight after they flye abroade and make no
more adoe.  The Dow lacking her Faune: the Hind her
Calfe, braie no longer time after their losse, but seing their
lacke to be without remedy, they cease their sorow within
short space.  Man onely among all other, ceaseth not to
fauour his sorowe, and lamenteth not onely so much as
nature willeth him, but also so much as his owne affection
moueth him.  And yet all folke doe not so, but such as are
subiect to passions, and furthest from fortitude of mind, as
women commonly rather then men, rude people rather then
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Immoderat sorowe,
not naturall.</note>
Godly folke: the vnlearned soner then the learned, foolish
folke soner then wise men, children, rather then yong men.
Whereupon we may well gather, that immoderate sorowe, is
not naturall (for that which is naturall, is euer like in all)
but through follie mainteined, encreased by weakenesse, and for
lack of reason made altogether intollerable.  Then I doubt
not, but your Grace wil rather ende your sorowe by reason:
then that sorowe should ende you through follie, and whereas
by nature, you are a weake woman in bodie, you will shewe
your selfe by reason, a strong man in heart: rather endyng
your greefe by Godly aduertisements, and by the iust <reg orig="considera-tion">consideration</reg>
of Gods wonderfull doings: then that time and space,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Time, a <reg orig="re-medie for">remedie for</reg>

should weare awaie your sorrowes, which in deede suffer none,
continually to abide in any one, but rather rid them of life,
or els ease them of griefe.  The foole, the vngodly, the weake
harted haue this remedie, your medicen must be more heauenly,
if you doe (as you professe) referre al to Gods pleasure, and
say in your praier.  Thy will be done in earth as it is in
heauen.  Those whom God loueth, those he chasteneth, and
happie is that bodie, whom God scourgeth for his amendment.
The man that dyeth in the faieth of Christ is blessed, and the
chastened seruaunt if he doe repent and amend his life, shalbe
blessed.  Wee knowe not what we doe when we bewaile the
death of our dearest, for in death is altogether al happinesse,
and before death not one is happie.  The miseries in this
world declare small felicitie to be in the same.  Therefore,

<pb n="78"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">78</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

many men being ouerwhelmed with much woe and wretched
wickednesse, haue wished and praied to God for an ende of
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">The greate miserie of
this worlde, makes
wearinesse of life.</note>
this life, and thought this worlde to be a let, to the heauenly
perfection, the which blisse all they shall attaine hereafter that
hope well here, and with a liuely faith declare their assuraunce.
Your Graces two sonnes in their life were so Godly, that their
death was their aduauntage: for, by death they liued, because
in life thei were dead.  They died in faith, not wearie of this
world, nor wishing for death, as ouer loden with sinne: but
paciently taking the crosse departed with ioy.  At whose
dying, your grace may learne an example of pacience and all
thankes giuing, that God of his goodnesse, hath so graciously
taken these your two children to his fauourable mercie.
God punished partly to trie your constancie, wherein I wish
that your grace may now bee as well willing to forsake them,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Impacience without
comfort.</note>
as euer you were willing to haue them.  But such is the
infirmitie of our flesh, that we hate good comfort in wordes,
when that cause of our comfort in deede (as we take it) is
gone.  And me thinkes I heare you crie notwithstanding al
my words: alacke my children are gone.  But what though
they are gone?  God hath called, and nature hath obeyed.
Yea, you crie still my children are dead: Marie therefore they
liued, and blessed is their ende whose life is so Godly.  Woe
worth they are dead they are ded.  It is no new thing, thei
are neither the first that died, not yet the last that shall die.
Many went before, and all shal folow after.  They liued
together, they loued together, &amp; now they are made their ende
both together.  Alas they died that were the fruite of myne
owne body, leauing me comfortles, vnhappie woman that

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Trees, not cursed,
because Apples fall
from them.</note>
I am.  You doe well, to call them the fruite of your bodie,
and yet you nothing the more vnhappie neither.  For is the
tree vnhappie, from which the Apples fall?  Or is the earth
accursed, that bringeth forth greene grasse, which hereafter
notwithstanding doth wither.  Death taketh no order of yeres,
but when the time is appointed, be it earely or late, daie or
night, away we must.  But I praie you, what loue hath your
Grace.  They dyed, that shoulde haue died, yea, they that
could liue no longer.  But you wished them longer life.  Yea,
[b]ut God made you no such promise, and meete it were not,
that he should be led by you, but you rather should bee led by

<pb n="79"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">79</fw>

him.  Your children died and that right Godly, what would
you haue more?  All good mothers desire that their children
may dye Gods seruauntes, the which your Grace hath most
assuredly obtained.  Now againe, mans nature altereth, and
hardly tarieth vertue long in one place, without much <reg orig="circum-spection">circumspection</reg>,
and youth may sone be corrupted.  But you will say.
These were good and Godly brought vp, and therefore, most
like to proue Godly hereafter if they had liued still.  Well,
though such things perhaps had not chaunced, yet such things
might haue chaunced, and although they happen not to al,
yet do they hap to many: and though they had not chaunced
to your children, yet we knew not that before: and more
wisedome it had bene, to feare the worst with good <reg orig="aduise-ment">aduisement</reg>,
then euer to hope, and looke still for the best, without
all mistrusting.  For such is the nature of man and his corrupt
race, that euermore the one followeth soner then the other.
<emph>Commodus</emph> was a vertuous childe, and had good bringing vp,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Commodus.
Nero.</note>
and yet he died a most wicked man.  <emph>Nero</emph> wanted no good
counsaile, and such a Master he had, as neuer any had the
better, and yet what one aliue was worse then he?  But now
death hath assured your Grace, that you may warrant your
selfe of their godly ende, whereas if God had spared them
life, things might haue chaunced otherwise.  In wishing longer
life, we wish often times longer woe, longer trouble, longer
folly in this world, and weigh all things well, you shall
perceiue we haue small ioye, to wish longer life.  This
imagination of longer life, when the life standeth not by the
number of yeres, but by the appointed will of God, maketh
our folly so much to appeare, and our teares so continually
to fall from our cheekes.  For if we thought (as wee should
doe in deed) that euery day rising, may be the end of euery
man liuing, and that there is no difference with GOD,
betwixt one day and an hundreth yeares, wee might beare all
sorrowes a great deale the better.  Therefore it were most
wisedome for vs all, and a great part of perfection, to make
euery day an euen reckening of our life, and talke so with
God euery howre, that we may be of euen boord with him,
through fulnesse of faith, and readie to goe the next howre
following at his commaundement, and to take alwaies his
sending in good part.  The Lorde is at hand.  We knowe

not when he will come (at midnight, at Cock crowe, or at
noone daies) to take either vs, or any of ours. Therfore, the
rather that we may be armed, let vs follow the examples of
other godly men, and lay their doings before your eyes.
And among al other, I know none so meete for your Graces
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">ii. Reg. xii.
Dauid.</note>
comfort, as the wise &amp; godly behauour of good King Dauid.
Who when he was enformed that his sonne was sicke, praied
to God hartely for his amendement, wept, fasted, and with
much lamentation declared great heauinesse.  But when word
came of his sonnes departure, hee left his mourning, he called
for water, and willed meate to be set before him, that he
might eate.  Whereupon, when his men marueiled why he
did so, considering he tooke it so greeuously before, when his
child was but sicke, and now being dead tooke no thought
at all, he made this answere vnto them: so long as my childe
liued I fasted, and watered my plants for my yong boye, and
I saied to my self, who can tel but that God perhappes will
giue me him, and that my childe shall liue: but now seing he
is dead, to what ende should I fast?  Can I call him againe
any more?  Nay, I shall rather goe vnto him, he shall neuer
come againe vnto me.  And with that Dauid comforted his
wife Bethsabe, the which example, as I trust your Grace hath
read for your comfort, so I hope you will also followe it for
your health, and be as strong in pacience as euer Dauid was.
The historie it selfe shal much delight your grace, being read
as it lieth in the booke, better then my bare touching of it

can doe a great deale.  The which I doubt not, but your
Grace will often reade and comfort your self, as Dauid did

had, forgat not to praise God in his extreame pouretie.

I will shewe you an example of a noble woman, in whom
appered wonderfull pacience.  <emph>Cornelia</emph> a worthy Lady in

<emph>Tiberius</emph>, and <emph>Caius Gracchus</emph>, both valiaunt Gentlemen, <reg orig="al-though">although</reg>
both not the most honest men, which died not in
their beds, but violently were slaine in ciuill battaile, their
bodies lying naked and vnburied, when one among other said:
oh vnhappie woman, that euer thou shouldest see this day.
Nay (quoth she) I will neuer thinke my selfe otherwise then
most happie, that euer I brought forth these two <emph>Gracchions</emph>.
If this noble Ladie could thinke her self happie, being mother
to these two valiaunt Gentlemen, and yet both Rebelles, &amp;
therefore iustly slaine: how much more may your Grace
thinke your self most happie, that euer you brought forth two
such  <emph>Brandons</emph>, not onely by naturall birth, but also by most
godly education in such sort, that the like two haue not beene
for their towardnesse vniuersally.  Whose death, the generall
voyce of all men, declares how much it was lamented.  So
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Bibulus.</note>
that, whereas you might euer haue feared some daungerous
end, now are you assured, that thei both made a most godly
ende, the which thing is the full perfection of a Christian

to die in one day, lamented the lack of them both for that
one day, and mourned no more.  And what could a man doe
lesse, then for two children to lament but one day, and yet
in my minde he lamented enough, and euen so much as was
reason for him to doe: whose doinges if al Christians would
followe, in my iudgement they should not onely fulfill Natures
rule, but also please God highly.  <emph>Horatius Puluillus</emph> being high
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Horatius

Priest at Roome, when he was occupied about the dedication
of the Temple, to the great God <emph>Iupiter</emph>, in the Capitolie,

solemne wordes, that his sonne was dead euen at the same
present: he did neuer plucke his hand from the post, least he
should trouble such a solemnitie, neither yet turned his
countenaunce from that publique Religion, to his priuate

God that after such a triumph, there were any harme like to
happen to the <emph>Romaines</emph>, the same might fall vpon his owne house.
Whereupon, when God had taken his two children from him,
immediatly after he thanked God, for graunting him his
bound.  For in so doing he was a meane, that the people
rather lamented <emph>Paulus Emilius</emph> lacke, then that <emph>Paulus</emph> or any

I for misfortunate men (if any such be misfortunate) seeing
it is an harder matter and a greater peece of worke to finde out

we shall finde enough subiect to this misfortune: for who
liueth that hath not lost?  Therfore I would wish your grace
euen now, to come in againe with God, and although he bee
angrie, yet shewe you your selfe most obedient to his will,
considering he is Lord ouer Kinges, Emperours, and ouer all
that bee, both in heauen and in earth, and spareth none whom
he listeth to take, and no doubt he will take all at the last.
His Darte goeth dayly, neither is any Dart cast in vaine,
which is sent amongst a whole Armie, standing thicke
together.  Neither can you iustly lament that they liued no

longer, for they liued long enough, that haue liued well
enough. You must measure your children by their vertues,
not by their yeares.  For (as the Wiseman saith) a mans
wisedome is the greye heares, and an vndefiled life is the
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Sapi. iv.</note>
old age.  Happie is that mother that hath had godlie children,
and not she that hath had long liuing children.  For, if
felicitie should stand by length of time, some Tree were more
happie then any man, for it liueth longer, and so like wise
brute beastes, as the Stagge, who liueth (as <emph>Plinie</emph> doth say)

then men.

two hundred yeres and more.  If wee would but consider
what man is, wee should haue small hope to liue, and little
cause to put any great assuraunce in this life.  Let vs see him
what he is: Is his bodie any thing els, but a lumpe of earth,
made together in such forme as we doe see?  A fraile vessel,
a weake carion subiect to miserie, cast doune with euery
light disease, a man to day, to morowe none.  A flowre that
this day is fresh, to morrowe withereth.  Good Lord doe wee
not see, that euen those thinges which nourish vs, doe rotte
and dye, as hearbes, birds, beastes, water, and al other,
without the which we cannot liue.  And how can we liue
euer, that are sustained with dead thinges?  Therefore, when
any one doth dye, why doe wee not thinke, that this may
chaunce to euery one, which now hath chaunced to any one.
We bee now as those that stand in battaile ray.  Not one
man is sure of himself before an other, but al are in daunger
in like maner to death.  That your children dyed before
other that were of riper yeres, we may iudge that their
ripenesse for vertue, and al other gifts of nature were brought
euen to perfection, whereby Death the soner approached, for
nothing long lasteth that is sone excellent.  God gaue your
grace two most excellent children: God neuer giueth for any
long time, those that bee right excellent.  Their natures
were heauenly, and therefore more meet for God then man.

Among fruite we see some apples are sone ripe, and fal from
the Tree in the middest of Sommer, other be still greene and

and some die in their midle age.  Your sonnes were euen
two such alreadie, as some hereafter may be with long
continuaunce of time.  They had that in their youth for the

<pb n="84"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">84</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

gifts of nature, which all men would require of them both
scarcely in their age.  Therefore being both now ripe, they
were most readie for God.  There was a childe in Roome of
a mans quantitie, for face, legges, and other parts of the
body, whereupon wise men iudged he would not be long
liuing.  How could your grace thinke, that when you saw
auncient wisedome in the one, and most pragnant wit in the
other, marueilous sobrietie in the elder, &amp; most laudable
gentlenesse in the yonger, them both most studious in learning,
most forward in al feates, aswel of the body as of the mind,
being two such and so excellent, that they were like long
to continue with you.  God neuer suffereth such excellent
and rare Iewels long to inherite the earth.  Whatsoeuer is
nie perfection, the same is most nye falling.  Vertue being
once absolute, cannot long  be seene with these our fleshly
eyes, neither can that tary the latter ende with other, that
was ripe it selfe first of al, and before other.  Fire goeth out
the soner, the clearer that it burneth: &amp; that light lasteth
longest, that is made of most course matter.  In greene wood
we may see, that where as the fuell is not most apt for  <reg orig="burn-ing">burning</reg>,
yet the fire lasteth longer, then if it were nourished with
like quantitie of drye wood.  Euen so in the nature of man,
the minde being ripe, the body decaieth straight, and life
goeth away being once brought to perfection.  Neither can
there be any greater token of short life, then full ripenesse of
natural wit: the which is to the body, as the heate of the
Sunne is to things earthly.  Therefore iudge right honorable
Ladie, that euen now they both died, when they both were
most readie for God, neither thinke that they died ouer sone
because they liued no longer.  They died both Gods seruaunts,
and therefore they dyed well and in good time.  God hath
set their time, and taken them at his time, blessed children
as they bee, to reigne with him in the kingdome of his
Father, prepared for them from the beginning.  Vnto whose
will I wish, and I trust your Grace doth wholie referre your
will, thanking him as hartely for that he hath taken them, as
you euer thanked him for that he euer lent you them.  I knowe

be esteemed, the more vngodly that it is.  Nay, your grace
may reioyce rather, that whereas you haue done well, you

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Math. v.</note>
when men speake all euill thinges against you.  And againe,

Be your Grace therefore strong in aduersitie, and pray for
them that speake amisse of you, rendring good for euill, and
with charitable dealing, shewe your selfe long suffering, so
shal you heape coales on their heads.  The boystrous Sea,

was neuer any victorie obtained.  You then beeing thus
assailed, shewe your selfe rather stoute to withstand, then
weake to giue ouer: rather cleauing to good, then yeelding to
euill.  For if God be with you, what forceth who be against
you.  For when all friends faile, God neuer faileth them
that put their trust in him, and with an vnfained heart call to

<p>THe whole burdein of weightie matters, and the earnest

Therefore, when matters concerning land, goodes, or life,
or any such thing of like weight are called in question, wee
must euer haue recourse to this kinde of Oration, and after
iust examining of our cause by the places thereof, looke for
iudgement according to the lawe.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subsection" n="Oration iudiciall what it is. "><head>Oration iudiciall what it is. </head>
<p>ORation Iudiciall, is an earnest debating in open assemblie,
of some weightie matter before a Iudge, where the

<p>NOt onely it is needefull in causes of iudgement, to
consider the scope whereunto we must leauell our
reasons, and direct our inuention: but also we ought in
euery cause to haue a respect vnto some one espesiall point
and chiefe article: that the rather the whole drift of our
doinges, may seeme to agree with our first deuised purpose.
For by this meanes our iudgement shalbe framed to speake
with discretion, and the ignoraunt shall learne to perceiue
with profite, whatsoeuer is said for his instruction.  But they
that take vppon them to talke in open audience, and make
not their accompt before, what they will speake after: shall
neither be well liked for their inuention, nor allowed for their

doe they, that boult out their wordes in such sort, and without
all aduisement vtter out matter: but shew themselues to

learned therfore, and such as loue to be coumpted clerkes of

do warely scan what they chiefly minde to speake, and
by definition seeke what that is, whereunto they purpose to
direct their whole doinges.  For by such aduised warenesse,
and good eye casting: they shall alwaies bee able both to
knowe what to say, and to speake what they ought.  As for
example, if I shal haue occasion to speake in open audience,
of the obedience due to our soueraigne King, I ought first to
learne what is obedience, and after knowledge attained, to
direct my reasons to the onely proofe of this purpose, and
wholie to seeke confirmation of the same, and not turne my
tale to talke of Robin Hood, and to shew what a goodly
Archer was he, or to speake wonders of the man in the
Moone, such as are most needlesse, and farthest from the

purpose.  For then the hearer looking to be taught his
obedience, and hearing in the meane season mad tales of
Archerie, and great meruailes of the man in the Moone:
being halfe astonied at his so great straying, will perhappes
say to himselfe: now whether the deuill wilt thou, come in
man againe for very shame, and tell me no bytales, such as
are to no purpose, but shew me that which thou didest
promise, both to teach and perswade at thy first entrie.
Assuredly such fond fellowes there haue bene, yea euen among
Preachers, that talking of faith, they haue fetcht their full
race from the xii. signes in the Zodiake.  An other talking of
the generall resurrection, hath made a large matter of our
blessed Ladie, praysing her to bee so gentle, so curteous, and
so kinde, that it were better a thousand fold, to make sute to
her alone, then to Christ her sonne.  And what needed
(I pray you) any such rehearsall being both vngodly, and
nothing at all to the purpose.  For what maketh the praise of
our Ladie, to the confirmation of the generall doome?
Would not a man thinke him mad, that hauing an earnest

to ride first into Northfolke, next into Essex, and last into

Kent?  And yet assuredly, many an vnlearned and witlesse
man, hath straied in his talke much farther a great deale, yea
truely as farre as hence to Roome gates.  Therefore wise are
they that followe <emph>Plinies</emph> aduise, who would that all men both
in writing, and speaking at large vpon any matter, should
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Plinies counsaile for
 <reg orig="han-deling">handeling</reg> of causes.</note>
euer haue an eye to the chiefe title, and principall ground of
their whole entent, neuer swaruing from their purpose, but
rather bringing all things together, to confirme their cause so
much as they can possible.  Yea, the wise and expert men will
aske of themselues, how hangeth this to the purpose?  To
what end do ye speake it?  What maketh this for confirmation
of my cause?  And so by oft questioning, either chide their
owne follie if they speake amisse, or els be assured they speake
to good purpose.</p>

<p>A state therefore generally, is the chiefe ground of a matter,
and the principall point whereunto both he that speaketh
should referre his whole wit, and they that heare should
chiefly marke.  A Preacher taketh in hande to shewe what
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">A state generally,

prayer is, and how needfull for man to call vpon God: now
he should euer remember this his matter, applying his reasons
whollie and fullie to this end, that the hearers may both
knowe the nature of prayer, and the needfulnesse of prayer.
The which when he hath done, his promise is fulfilled, his
time well bestowed, and the hearers well instructed.</p></div3></div2>

<p>IN all other causes the state is gathered without contention,
and seuerally handled vpon good aduisement, as he shal
think best that professeth to speake.  But in matters <reg orig="crimin-all">criminall</reg>,
where iudgement is required: there are two persons at
the least, which must through contrarietie stand and rest vpon
some issue.  As for example.  A seruing man is apprehended
by a Lawyer for Felonie, vpon suspition.  The Lawyer saith
to the seruing man: thou hast done this Robberie.  Nay
(saith he) I haue not done it.  Vpon this conflict and <reg orig="match-ing">matching</reg>
together ariseth this State, whether this seruing man hath
done this Robberie, or no?  Vppon which point the Lawyer
must stand, and seeke to proue it to the vttermost of his

<p>A state thereof in matters of Iudgement, is that thing which

<pb n="89"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">89</fw>

doth arise vpon the first demaund, and denial made betwixt
men, whereof the one part is the accuser, and the other part
the person, or persons accused.  It is called a State, because
wee doe stande and rest vpon some one point, the which must
wholie and only be proued of the one side, and denied of the

other.  I cannot better terme it in English, then by the name
of an issue, the which not onely ariseth vpon much debating,
and long trauers vsed, whereupon all matters are saied to come
to an issue: but also els where an issue is said to be then, and
so often, as both parties stand vpon one point, the which doth
as well happen at the first beginning, before any probations
are vsed, as it doth at the latter ending, after the matter hath
at large bene discussed.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subsection" n="The deuision of States, or issues. "><head>The deuision of States, or issues. </head>
<p>NOW that wee knowe what an Issue is, it is next most
needefull, to shewe how many there are in number.
The wisest and best learned haue agreed vpon three onely
and no lesse, the which are these following.

<list type="ordered"><head>The state.</head>
<item n="i">Coniecturall.</item>
<item n="ii">Legall.</item>
<item n="iii">Iuridiciall.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>AND for the more plaine vnderstanding of these darke
wordes, these three questions following, expounde their
meaning altogether.
<list type="ordered">
<item n="i">Whether the thing be, or no.</item>
<item n="ii">What it is.</item>
<item n="iii">What maner of thing it is.</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>IN the first wee consider vpon the rehearsall of a matter,
whether any such thing bee, or no.  As if one should bee
accused of murther, good it were to knowe, whether any
murther were committed at all, or no, if it bee not perfectly
knowne before: and after to goe further, and examine
whether such a man that is accused, haue done the deede, or no.</p>

<p>In the second place we doubt not vpon the thing done, but
we stand in doubt what to call it.  Sometimes a man is
accused of Felony, and yet he proueth his offence to be but
a trespasse, whereupon he escapeth the daunger of death.  An
other beeing accused for killing a man, confesseth his fault to
bee manslaughter, and denieth it vtterly to bee any murther,
whereupon hee maketh friends to purchase his pardon.  Now

<pb n="90"/>

the Lawyers by their learning, must iudge the doubt of this
debate, and tell what name he deserueth to haue, that hath
thus offended.</p>

<p>In the third place not onely the deed is confessed, but the
maner of doing is defended.  And if one were accused for
killing a man, to confesse the deede, and also to stande in it
that hee might iustly so doe, because he did it in his owne
defence: whereupon ariseth this question, whether his doing
be right or wrong.  And to make these matters more plaine,
I will adde an example for euery state seuerally.</p>

<p>AS Nature hath euer abhorred Murder, and God in all ages
most terribly hath plagued bloodshedding, so I trust your
wisedomes (most worthie Iudges) will speedely seeke the
execution of this most hatefull sinne.  And where as God
reuealeth to the sight of men, the knowledge of such offences
by diuers likelihoods, &amp; probable coniectures: I doubt not,
but you being called of God to heare such causes, will doe
herein as reason shal require, and as this detestable offence
shal moue you, vpon rehearsall of the matter.  The man that
is wel knowne to be slaine, was a worthie Farmer, a good
housekeeper, a wealthie Husbandman, one that trauailed much
in this worlde, meaning vprightly in all his doinges, and
therefore beloued among al men, &amp; lamented of many when
his death was knowne.  This Souldier beeing desperate in his
doinges, and liuing by spoyle all his life time, came newly from
the Warres, whose handes hath bene lately bathed in blood, and
now he keepeth this Countrey (where this Farmer was slaine)
and hath beene here for the space of one whole Moneth
together, and by all likelihoodes, he hath slaine this honest
Farmer.  For such men flesht villaines, make small acoumpt
for killing any one, and doe it they will without any mercie,
when they maye see their time.  Yea, this wretch is bruted

for his beastly demeanour, and knowne of long time to be
a strong theef. Neither had he escaped the daunger of the
lawe, if the Kings free Pardon had not preuented the <reg orig="execu-tion">execution</reg>.
His name declares his naughtie nature, and his wicked
liuing hath made him famous.  For who is he that hearing of
N. (the notable offenders name, might here bee rehearsed)
doth not thinke by and by, that hee were like to doe such
a deede?  Neither is he onely knowne vniuersally to bee
naught, but his soyle also (where he was borne) giueth him to
bee an euill man: considering he was bredde and brought vp
among a denne of Theeues, among the men of Tinsdale &amp;
Riddesdale, where pillage is good purchase, and murthering is
coumpted manhood.  Occupation hath he none, nor yet any
other honest meanes, whereby to maintaine himselfe: and yet
he liueth most sumpteously.  No greater gamester in a whole
Countrey, no such ryotor, a notable whoremonger, a leaude
Royster among Ruffians, a notable waister, to day full of
money, within seuen night after not worth a groate.  There
is no man that seeth him, but will take him for his Apparell
to be a gentleman.  He hath his chaunge of suites, yea, he
spareth not to goe in his Silkes and Veluet.  A great
quareller and fray maker, glad when he may be at defiance
with one or other, he made such shiftes for money ere now,
that I maruaile how he hath liued till this day.  And now
being at a lowe ebbe, and loth to seeme base in his estate,
thought to aduenture vpon this Farmer, and either to winne
the Saddle, or els to lose the Horse.  And thus beeing so
farre forward, wanting no will to attempt this wicked deede,
he sought by all meanes possible, conuenient oportunitie to
compasse his desire.  And wayting vnder a Wood side, nigh
vnto the high way, about sixe a clocke at night, hee set vppon
this Farmer, at what time he was comming homeward.  For
it appeareth not onely by his owne confession, that hee was
there aboute the selfe same time, where this man was slaine:
but also there bee men that sawe him ride in great haste,
about the selfe same time.  And because God would haue this
murder to be knowne, looke I pray you, what bloud he
carieth about him, to beare witnesse against him of his most
wicked deede.  Againe, his owne confession doth plainly goe
against him, for he is in so many tales, that he cannot tell



<pb n="94"/>

<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

what to say.  And often his colour chaungeth, his bodie
shaketh, and his tongue foultereth within his mouth.  And
such men as hee bringeth in to beare witnesse with him, that
he was at such a place at the self same howre, when the Farmer
was slaine: they will not bee sworne for the very hower, but
they say he was at such a place within two howres after.
Now Lord, doth not this matter seeme most plaine vnto al
men, especially seeing this deede was done at such a time,
and in such a place, that if the Deuill had not beene his
good Lord, the matter had neuer come to light.  And who
will not say, that this caytife had little cause to feare, but
rather power enough to doe his wicked fact, seeing he is so
sturdie and so strong, and the other so weake and vnweldie:
yea, seeing this vilaine was armed, and the other man naked.
Doubt you not (worthie Iudges) seeing such notes of his
former life, to declare his inward nature, and perceiuing such
coniectures lawfully gathered vpon iust suspition: but that
this wretched souldier hath slaine this worthy Farmer.  And
therefore, I appeale for Iustice vnto your wisedomes, for the
death of this innocent man, whose blood before God asketh
iust auengement.  I doubt not but you remember the wordes
of Salamon, who saith: It is as great sinne to forgiue the
wicked, as it is euill to condemne the innocent: and as I call
vnfeinedly for rightfull Iudgement, so I hope assuredly for
iust execution.</p>

<p>THen we vse to define a matter, when we cannot agree
vpon the nature of some worde, the which wee learne to
knowe by asking the question, what it is.  As for example.
Where one is apprehended for killing a man, we lay murder
to his charge: whereupon the accused person, when he
graunteth the killing, &amp; yet denieth it to be murder: we
must streight after haue recourse to the definition, and aske
what is murder, by defining whereof, and comparing the

<div2 type="subsection" n="Contrary Lawes. "><head>Contrary Lawes. </head>
<p>IT often happeneth, that lawes seeme to haue a certain
repugnancie, whereof among many riseth much contention,
whereas if both the lawes were well weighed and considered,
according to their circumstances, they would appeare nothing
contrary in matter, though in words they seeme to dissent.
Christ giueth warning, and chargeth his Disciples in the x. of
Math. that they preach not the glad tidinges of his comming
into the worlde, to the Gentiles, but to the Iewes onely,
vnto whom he was sent by his father.  And yet after his
resurrection, we doe reade in the last of Matthewe, that he
commaunded his disciples to go into all the whole world, and
preach the glad tidings of his passion, and raunsome, paied
for all creatures liuing.  Now, though these two lawes
seeme contrary, yet it is nothing so.  For, if the Iewes
would haue receiued Christ, and acknowledged him their
Sauiour, vndoubtedly, they had beene the onely Children of
God, vnto whom, the promise and couenaunt was made from
the beginning.  But because they refused their Sauiour, and
crucified the Lord of glorie: Christ made the lawe generall,
and called all men to life that would repent, promising
saluation to all such, as beleeued and were Baptised.  So
that the particuler lawe being now abrogated, must needes
giue place to the superiour.</p></div2>

<p>THere be lawes vttered by Christes owne mouth, the
which if they bee taken according as they are spoken,
seeme to containe great absurditie in them.  And therefore,
the minde of the lawe maker, must rather bee obserued, then
the bare words taken only as they are spoken.  Christ saieth
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Math. 5.
Math. 19.
Math. 16.</note>
in the fifth of Matthewe.  If thy right eye be an offence to
thee, plucke him out, and cast him away from thee.  If one
giue thee a blow of thy right cheeke, turne to him again thy
left cheke.  There be some Eunuches, that haue gelded
themselues from the kingdome of Heauen.  Goe and sell all
that thou haste, and giue it to the poore.  He that doth not
take vp his crosse and followe me, is not worthy of mee.  In
all which sentences, there is no such meaning, as the bare
words vttered seeme to yeeld.  Plucking out of the eye,
declares an auoyding of all euill occasions.  Receiuing a
blowe vpon the left cheeke, commendes vnto vs modestie,
and pacience in aduersitie.  Gelding, signifieth a subduing of
our affections, and taming the foule lust of pleasure, vnto the
wil of reason.  Goe and sell all: declares we should be
liberall, and glad to parte with our goodes to the poore and
needie.  Bearing the crosse betokeneth sufferaunce of all
sorowes and miseries in this worlde.  Now, to proue that the
will of the law maker, is none other then I haue said: I may

Iudges that they beare themselues hault, and stout vpon their
wealthie freendes, and oppresse poore men by might, not
regarding their honestie, but seeking alwaies by hooke and
crooke, to robbe poore men of their Farmes, Leases, and
money.  And by the way, declare some one thing that they
haue done, which honest eares would scant abide to heare.</p>

<p>We shall make them to bee set naught by, if we declare
what luskes they are, how vnthriftely they liue, how they doe
nothing from day to day, but eate, drinke, and sleepe, rather
seeking to liue like beastes, then minding to liue like men,
either in profiting their countrie, or in tendering their owne
commoditie, as by right they ought to doe.</p>

<p>We shall get good will, by speaking of the Iudges and
hearers: if wee shall commend their worthie doings, and
prayse their iust dealing, and faithfull execution of the Lawe,

<pb n="103"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">103</fw>

and tell them in what estimation the whole countrey hath
them, for their vpright iudging and determining of matters,
and therefore in this cause needes must it be, that they must
answere their former doings, and iudge so of this matter, as
al good men haue opinion they will doe.</p>

<p>We shall finde fauour by speaking of the matter, if in
handling our owne cause, we commende it accordingly, and
dispraise the attempt of our aduersary, extenuating all his
chiefe purposes, so much as shall be necessarie.</p>

<p>Now resteth for me to speake of the other parte of<reg orig="Enter-ance">Enterance</reg>
into an Oration, which is called a close, or priuie getting
of fauour when the cause is daungerous, and cannot easely by
heard without displeasure.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Insinuation.</note>
A priuie beginning, or creeping in, otherwise called
Insinuation, must then, and not els be vsed, when the Iudge
is greeued with vs, and our cause hated of the hearers.</p>

<p>The cause selfe oftentimes is not liked for three diuers
causes, if either the matter selfe be vnhonest, and not meete
to be vttered before an audience, or els if the Iudge himself
by a former tale be perswaded to take parte against vs, or last
if at that time we are forced to speake, when the Iudge is
weried with hearing of other.  For the Iudge himselfe being
weried by hearing, will bee much more greeued if any thing
be spoken either ouermuch, or els against his liking.  Yea
who seeth not that a weried man wil sone mislike a right good
matter?  If the matter be so hainous that it can not be heard
without offence, (as if I should take a mans parte, who were
generally hated) wisedome were to let him goe, and take some
other whom all men liked: or if the cause were thought not
honest, to take some other in steede thereof which were better
liked, till they were better prepared to heare the other: so
that euermore nothing should be spoken at the first, but that
which might please the Iudge, and not to be acknowne once
to thinke of that, which yet we minde most of all to perswade.
Therefore, when the hearers are some what calmed, we may
enter by little and little into the matter, and say that those
things, which our aduersary doth mislike in the person
accused, we also doe mislike the same.  And when the hearers
are thus wonne, wee may say that all which was saide nothing
toucheth vs, and that we minde to speake nothing at al

<pb n="104"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">104</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

against our aduersaries, neither this way nor that way.
Neither were it wisedome openly to speake against them,
which are generally well esteemed and taken for honest men.
And yet it were not amisse for the furtherance of our owne
causes, closely to speake our phantasie, and so, streight to
aulter their hearts.  Yea, and to tel the Iudges the like in
a like matter, that such and such iudgement hath been
giuen: And therefore at this time, considering the same case,
and the same necessitie, like iudgement is looked for.  But
if the aduersarie haue so tolde his tale, that the Iudge is
wholly bent to giue sentence with hym, and that it is well
knowne, vnto what reasons the iudge moste leaned, and was
perswaded: we may first promise to weaken that, which the
aduersarie hath made most strong for himself, and confute
that parte, which the hearers did most esteeme, and best of all
like.  Or els we may take aduauntage, of some part of our
aduersaries tale, and talke of that first, which he spake last:
or els begin so, as though wee doubted what were best first
to speake, or to what part it were most reason, first of all to
answere, wondering and taking God to witnesse, at the
strangenesse of his reporte, and confirmation of his cause.
For when the standers by, perceiue that the answerer (whome
the aduersaries thought in their minde, was wholly abashed)
feareth so little the obiections of his aduersarie, and is readie
to answere <emph>Ad omnia Quare</emph>, with a bolde countenance: They
will thinke that they themselues, rather gaue rash credite,
and were ouerlight in beleeuing the first tale: then that he,
which now answereth in his owne cause, speaketh without
ground, or presumeth vpon a stomack to speake for himselfe,
without iust consideration.</p>

<p>But if the time be so spent, and the tale so long in telling,
that all men be almost weried to heare any more: then we
must make promise at the first to be very short, and to lappe
vp our matter in fewe words.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Mirth making good

And if time may so serue, it were good when men be
wearied to make them somwhat mery, and to begin with
some pleasaunt tale, or take an occasion to iest wittely, vppon
some thing then presently done.</p>

<p>Or if the time will not serue for pleasaunt tales, it were
good to tell some straunge thing, some terrible wonder, that

they all may quake at the onely hearing of the same.  For,
like as when a mans stomack is full, and can brooke no more
meate, hee may stirre his appetite, either by some Tart
sawce, or els quicken it somewhat by some sweete dish: Euen
so when the audience is wearied with weightie affaires, some
strange wonders may call vp their spirites, or els some merie
tale may cheare their heauie lookes.</p>

<p>And assuredly, it is no small cunning to moue the hearts of
men, either to mirth, or sadnesse: for he that hath such skill,
shall not lightly faile of his purpose, what soeuer matter he
taketh in hande.</p>

<p>Thus haue I taught what an enterance is, and how it
should be vsed.  Notwithstanding, I thinke it not amisse,
often to rehearse this one point, that euermore the beginning
be not ouermuch laboured, nor curiously made, but rather
apt to the purpose, seeming vpon present occasion, euermore
to take place, and so to bee deuised, as though wee speake
altogether, without any great studie, framing rather our tale
to good reason, then our tongue to vaine painting of the
matter.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Enteraunces apt

In all which discourse, whereas I haue framed all the
lessons and euery enterance properly, to serue for pleading at

<p>And no doubt, many of them haue much neede to knowe

whereas oftentimes they beginne as much from the matter,

the learned Clarkes of this our time, haue thought it good,
that all Preachers should take their beginning, vpon the
occasion of such matter, as is there written, declaring why
and wherefore, and vpon what consideration such wordes were
in those dayes so spoken, that the reason giuen of such talke
then vttered, might serue well to beginne their Sermon.  Or

comprehendeth the whole matter following, or els to beginne

	</div2>

<div2 type="subsection" n="Of Narration."><head>Of Narration.</head>
<p>AFter the preface and first Enterance, the matter must be
opened, and euery thing liuely tolde, that the hearers
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Narration. i. Briefe.
ii. Plaine. iii.<reg orig="Prob-able">Probable</reg>.</note>
may fully perceiue what we goe about, nowe in reporting an
act done, or vttering the state of a controuersie, we must vse
these lessons, wherof the first is to be short, the next to bee
plaine, and the third is to speake likely, and with reason,
that the hearers may remember, vnderstand, and beleeue the
rather, such things as shall be saied.</p>

<p>And first whereas we should be short in telling the matter
as it lieth, the best is to speake no more than needes wee must,
not rauing it from the bottome, or telling bytales such as rude
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Breuitie, how it
might be vsed.</note>
people full oft doe, nor yet touching euery pointe, but telling
the whole in a grosse somme.  And where as many matters
shall neither harme vs, nor yet doe vs good being brought in,
and reported by vs: it were well done not to medle with them
at all, nor yet twise to tell one thing, or report that which is
odious to be tolde againe.  Notwithstanding this one thing
would be wel considered, that in seking to be short we be not
obscure.  And therefore to make our matter plaine, that all
may vnderstand it, the best were first and formost to tell euery
thing in order so much as is needful, obseruing both the time,
the place, the maner of doing, and the circumstances<reg orig="there-unto">thereunto</reg>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Plainesse, how
it might be vsed.</note>
belonging.  Wherein good heed would be had that
nothing be doubtfully spoken, which may haue a double<reg orig="mean-ing">meaning</reg>,
nor yet any thing vttered that may make asmuch against
vs as with vs, but that all our wordes runne to confirme wholy
our matter.  And surely if the matter be not so plainely told
that all may vnderstand it, wee shall doe little good in the rest
of our report.  For in other partes of the Oration if we be
somwhat darke, it is lesse harme, wee may bee more plaine in
an other place.  But if the Narration, or substaunce of the tale
be not well perceiued, the whole Oration besides is darkned
altogether.  For to what ende should we goe about to proue

<pb n="107"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">107</fw>

that, which the hearers knowe not what it is?  Neither can
we haue any libertie to tell our tale againe after we haue once
tolde it, but must streight goe foorth and confirme that which we
haue saied, how soeuer it is.  Therefore the reporting of our
tale, may sone appere plain if we first expresse our minde in
plaine words, and not seeke these roperipe termes, which
betraie rather a foole, then commende a wise man: and
againe, if we orderly obserue circumstaunces, and tell one thing
after an other, from time to time, not tumbling one tale in
anothers necke, telling halfe a tale, and so leauing it rawe,
hacking and hemming, as though our wittes and our senses were
a woll gathering.  Neither should we suffer our tongue, to run
before our witte, but with much warenesse, set foorth our
matter, and speake our minde euermore with iudgement.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Probabilities how

</p>
<p>We shall make our sayings appeare likely, and probable:
if we speake directly as the cause requireth, if we shewe the
verie purpose of all the deuise, and frame our inuention,
according as we shall thinke them most willing to allowe it,
that haue the hearing of it.</p>

<p>The Narration reported in matters of iudgement, shall seem
to stand with reason, if we make our talk to agree with the
place, time, thing, and person, if wee shall shewe that<reg orig="what-soeuer">whatsoeuer</reg>
wee say, the same by all likelihoodes is true, if our
coniectures, tokens, reasons, and arguments bee such, that
neither in them, there appere any fabling, nor yet that any

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Narration in
iudgement.</note>
and that we not onely speake this, but that diuers other of
good credite will stand with vs in defence of the same, all
which reporting may sone be liked, and the tale so tolde, may
be thought very reasonable.  Yea, wee shall make our doings
seeme reasonable, if we frame our worke to natures will, and
seeke none other meanes but such onely, as the honest and
wise haue euer vsed and allowed, bringing in and blaming the
euill alwayes, for such faultes chiefly, wherevnto they most of
all are like to be subiect, as to accuse a spende all, of theft:
a whoremonger, of adulterie: a rash quarreller, of<reg orig="man-slaughter">manslaughter</reg>:
and so of other.  Sometimes it is good and<reg orig="profit-able">profitable</reg>,
to bee merie and pleasaunt, in reporting a matter,
against some maner of man, and in some cause.  For, neither
against all men that offende, nor yet against all matters,

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Narration in praysing

should the wittie alwaies vse iesting.  And now, for those
that shall tel their minde, in the other kindes of Oratorie, as
in the kinde Demonstratiue, Deliberatiue, in exhorting or
perswading: the learned haue thought meet that they must
also call the whole somme of their matter to one point, that
the rather the hearers may better perceiue, whereat they leuell all
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Preachers what
order they vse.</note>
their reasons.  As if a Clarke doe take in hande to declare Gods
heft, he will after his enteraunce, tell what thing is chiefly
purposed in that place, and next after, shew other things
annexed therevnto, whereby not only the hearers may get
great learning, and take much profite of his doctrine: but he
himselfe may knowe the better what to say, what order to vse,
and when to make an ende.</p>

<p>Some do vse after the litterall sense, to gather a misticall
vnderstanding, and to expounde the sayings spiritually, making
their Narration altogether of things heauenly.  Some<reg orig="rehear-sing">rehearsing</reg>
a text particularly spoken, applie the same generally vnto
al states, enlarging the Narration most Godly, by comparing
words long agoe spoken, with things and matters that are
presently done.  Notwithstanding, the auncient fathers,
because they did onely expounde the Scriptures for the most
parte, made no artificiall Narration, but vsed to followe such
order, as the plaine text gaue them.  So that if euery sentence
were plainly opened to the hearers, they went not much farther,
sauing that when any word gaue them occasion to speake of
some vice, they would largely say their minde in that behalf:
as <emph>Chrisostome</emph> and <emph>Basile</emph> haue done with other.</p>

<p>The ware marking, and heedy obseruation of time, place,
and person, may teach all men (that be not past teaching) how
to frame their Narration in all controuersies, that are called
in question, and therefore, when present occasion shall giue
good instruction, what need more lessons?  And especially,
feeling Nature teacheth what is comely, and what is not comely
for all tymes.</p>

<p>Yea, what tell I now of such lessons, seeing GOD hath
raised such worthy Preachers in this our tyme, that their Godly
and learned doings, may be a most iust example for all other
to followe: aswell for their liuing, as for their learning:
I feare me, the precepts be more in number, then will be well
kept, or followed this yere.</p>

Of Deuision.</head>


<p>AFter our tale is tolde, and the hearers haue well learned
what we meane, the next is to reporte wherein the
aduersarie and wee can not agree, and what it is, wherein wee
doe agree.  And then to parte out such principall pointes,
whereof we purpose fully to debate, and laie them out to be
knowen: that the hearers may plainly see, what wee will say,
and perceiue at a worde the substaunce of our meaning.  Now,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Deuision of three
partes at the most.</note>
<emph>Tullie</emph> would not haue a deuision to be made, of, or aboue
three partes at the moste, nor yet lesse then three neither, if
neede so require.  For if we haue three chiefe groundes,
wherevpon to rest, applying all our arguments therevnto, we
shall both haue matter enough to speake of, the hearers shall
with ease vnderstande our meaning, and the whole Oration
shall sone bee at an ende.  Notwithstanding, this lesson must
not so curiously bee kept, as though it were sinne to make the
deuision of fower, or fiue partes: but it was spoken for this
end, that the deuision should be made of as fewe as may be
possible, that men may the better carie it away, and the
reporter with more ease, may remember what he hath to saie.
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Women<reg orig="re-buked that">rebuked that</reg>
nurse not their owne
children.</note>
Now in praising, or dispraising, in perswading, or disswading,
deuisions must also be vsed.  As if one would enueigh against
those women, that will not giue their owne children sucke, he
might vse this deuision.  Where as women commonly put
their children forth to nursing, I will proue, that it is both
against the lawe of Nature, and also against Gods holy wil:
againe I wil shewe that it is harmefull, both for the childes
bodie, and also for his witte: lastly I will proue that the
mother selfe, falleth into much sicknesse thereby.</p>

<p>First, Nature giueth milke to the woman, for none other
ende but that she should bestow it vpon her childe.  And we
see beastes feede their yongones, and why should not Women?
GOD also commaunded all women, to bring vp their children.</p>

<p>Againe, the childrens bodies shall be so affected, as the
milke is which they receiue.  Now, if the Nurse bee of an
euill complexion, or haue some hid disease, the childe sucking
of her breast, must needes take parte with her.  And if that
be true, which the learned doe say, that the temperature of the
minde followes the constitution of the bodie, needes must
it be, that if the Nurse be of a naughtie nature, the childe

<pb n="110"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">110</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

must take thereafter.  But if it be, the Nurse be of a good
complexion, of an honest behauiour (whereas contrariwise,
Maidens that haue made a scape, are commonly called to be
Nurses) yet can it not be, but that the mothers milke should
be much more naturall for the childe, then the milke of
a stranger.  As by experience, let a man bee long vsed to one
kinde of drinke, if the same man chaunge his ayre, and his
drinke, he is like to mislike it.  Lastly, for the mothers,
howe are they troubled with sore breastes, besides other
diseases that happen through plentie of milke, the which
Phisitions can tell, and women full oft haue felt.</p>

<p>Likewise in speaking of fasting, I might vse this diuision.
First, it is Godly to faste, because the spirite is more free, and
apter for a good worke.  Againe, it is wholsome, because
thereby euill humours are wasted, and many diseases either
clerely put away, or much abated of their tirannie.  Lastly,
it is profitable, because men spend lesse money, the lesse
banqueting that they vse.  Therefore, if men loue eitheir to
be wise, Godly, healthful, or wealthie, let them vse fasting
and forbeare excesse.</p>

<p>Now vpon a deuision, there might also be made a<reg orig="sub-deuision">subdeuision</reg>,
as where I say it is Godly to fast, I might deuide
Godlinesse into the hearing of Gods worde, into praying
deuoutly, and charitable dealing with all the worlde.</p>

<p>Againe, speaking of health, I might say that the whole
body is not onely more lustie with moderate fasting, but also
more apt for all assaies.  The learned man studieth better
when he fasteth, then when he is full.  The counseler heareth
causes with lesse pain being emptie, then he shalbe able after
a full gorge.</p>

<p>Againe, whereas the fiue senses bring vs to the knowledge
of many things: the more apt that euery one is, the more
pleasure they bring euer with them.  The eyes see more
clerely, the eares heare more quickly, the tongue rowleth
more roundly, and tasteth things better, our feeling is more
perfite: and the nose smeleth euill sauours the soner.

subdiuisions, and largely set them out.  But these may suffice
for this time.</p>
	</div2>
<div2 type="subsection" n="Of Propositions."><head>Of Propositions.</head>
<p><emph>QUintilian</emph> willeth, that straight and immediatly after the
Narration, there should also bee vsed such sentences as
might be full of pith, and containe in them the substaunce of
much matter, the rather that the hearers may be stirred vpon
the only report of some sentencious saying, or weightie text
in the Lawe.  As in speaking largely against extortion, one
might after his reasons applied to the purpose, bring in
a pithie and sentencious proposition: as thus.  Those hands
are euill that scratch out the eyes: and what other doe they
that by force robbe their Christian brethren: Woe bee to
that Realme, where might out goeth right.  Or thus.  When
rage doth rule, and reason doth want, what good man can
hope to liue long in rest.  Also an act of a Realme, may well
serue to make a proposition.  As thus.  The Law is plaine:
that man shall die as an offender, whatsoeuer he be that
breaketh vp an other mans house, and seeketh by spoyle to
vndoe his neighbour.  Now here is no man that doubteth,
but that thou hast done this deede, therefore what needes any
more, but that thou must suffer according to the law?  In
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Thankfulnesse,
what it is.</note>
deuiding a matter, Propositions are vsed and orderly applied
for the better setting forth of the cause.  As if I should
speake of thankfulnesse, I might first shew what is<reg orig="thankful-nesse">thankfulnesse</reg>,
next how needfull it is, and last how commendable and
profitable it is vniuersally?  Thankfulnesse is a kinde of
remembring good will shewed, and an earnest desire to
requite the same.  Without thankfulnesse no man would doe
for an other.  The brute beastes haue these properties, and
therefore man cannot want them, without his great rebuke.
Some propositions are plaine spoken, without any cause or
reason added thereunto.  As thus, I haue charged this man
with Felonie, as you haue heard, but he denieth it, therefore
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Deuision of

iudge you it I pray you.  Sometimes a cause added, after the
aledging of a proposition.  As thus: I haue accused this man
of felonie, because he tooke my purse by the hye way side, and
therefore I call for Iustice.  Thus propositions might be
gathered, next and immediatly after the rehearsall of any

marked, the place, the maner of doing, and what heart he
bare him.  As the opertunitie of doing, and the power he
had to doe this deede.  The which all set together shall either
acquit him, or finde him giltie.  These arguments serue to
confirme a matter in iudgement, for any hainous offence.
But in the other causes which are occupied, either in praising,
or dispraising, in perswading, or disswading, the places of
confirmation be such as are before rehearsed, as when we
commende a thing, to proue it thus.

vsed to proue: if we take the contrary of the same.  For as

are builded, so they be ouerthrowne.  What though many

<div2 type="subsection" n="The Conclusion."><head>The Conclusion.</head>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Conclusion,
what it is.</note>
<p>A Conclusion, is the handsomely lapping vp together, and
briefe heaping of all that which was saied before, stirring
the hearers by large vtterance, and plentifull gathering of
good matter, either the one way or the other.</p>

<p>There are two parts of a conclusion, the one resteth in
gathering together briefly, all such arguments as were before
rehearsed, reporting the somme of them in as fewe wordes as
can bee, and yet after such a sorte, that much varietie bee
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Conclusion of
two sorts.</note>
vsed, both when the rehearsall is made, as also after the matter is
fullie reported.  For if the repetition should be naked, and
only set forth in plaine words without any chaunge of speech,
or shift of <emph>Rhetorique</emph>, neither should the hearers take pleasure,
nor yet the matter take effect.  Therefore, when the Orator
shall touch any place, which may giue iust cause to make an
exclamation, and stirre the hearers to bee sorie, to bee glad,
or to bee offended: it is necessarie to vse Art to the<reg orig="vtter-most">vttermost</reg>.
Or when he shall come to the repeating of an hainous
act, and the maner thereof: hee may set the Iudges on fire,
and heate them earnestly against the wicked offender.  Thus
in repeating, Art may be vsed, and next with the onely
rehearsal, matters may bee handsomely gathered vp together.
The other part of a conclusion, resteth either in augmenting
and vehemently enlarging that, which before was in fewe
wordes spoken to set the Iudge or hearers in a heate: or els
to mittigate, &amp; asswage displeasure conceiued with much
lamenting of the matter, and moouing them thereby the
rather to shewe mercie.  Amplification is of two sorts,
whereof I will speake more at large in the next chapter.
The one resteth in wordes, the other in matter.  Such wordes
must be vsed as bee of great weight, wherein either is some
Metaphore, or els some large vnderstanding is conteined.
Yea, wordes that fill the mouth and haue a sound with them,
set forth a matter very well.  And sometimes wordes twise
spoken, make the matter appeare greater.</p>

<p>Againe, when we first speake our minde in lowe wordes,
and after vse weightier, the fault likewise seemeth the greater.
As when one had killed a Gentleman, thus might an other
amplifie his minde.  For one slaue to strike an other, were
worthie of punishment, but what deserueth that wretch, which

<pb n="115"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">115</fw>

not onely striketh a man, but striketh a Gentleman, and not
onely striketh a Gentleman, but cowardly killeth a Gentleman,
not giuing him one wound, but giuing him twentie.  To kill
any man in such sort deserueth death, but what say you of him,
that not onely killeth him so, but also hangeth him most
spitefully vpon a Tree.  And yet not content with that, but
scourgeth him and mangleth him when he is dead, &amp; last of
al maketh a iest of his most naughtie deede, leauing a writing
there about the dead mans necke.  Now then, seeing his
crueltie is such, that the onely killing can not content his
deuilish deede, and most deadly malice: I aske it for Gods
loue, and in the way of Iustice, that this wicked deuill may
suffer worthie death, and be punished to the example of al
other.  Amplifying of the matter consisteth in heaping and
enlarging of those places, which serueth for confirmation of
a matter.  As the definition, the cause, the consequent, the
contrary, the example, and such other.</p>

<p>Againe, amplification may bee vsed when wee make the
lawe to speake, the dead person to make his complaint, the
Countrey to crye out of such a deede.  As if some worthie
man were cast away, to make the Countrie say thus: if
England could speake, would she not make such and such
complaintes?  If the walles of such a citie or towne had
a tongue, would they not talke thus and thus?  And to be
short, al such things should bee vsed, to make the cause seeme
great, which concerne God, or Common weale, or the Lawe
of Nature.  For if any of these three bee hindered, wee haue
a large fielde to walke in.  In praising or dispraising, wee
must exaggerate those places towardes the ende, which make
men wonder at the straungenesse of any thing.  In perswading
or disswading the rehearsall of commodities, and heaping of
examples together increase much the matter.  It were a great
labour to tell all the commodities, and all the properties
which belong vnto the conclusion.  For such art may bee
vsed in this behalfe, that though the cause bee very euill, yet
a wittie man may get the ouerhand, if he be cunning in his
facultie.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Athenians forbad
conclusions.</note>
The <emph>Athenians</emph> therefore did straightly forbid by a Lawe, to
vse any conclusion of the cause, or any enterance of the matter
to winne fauour.  <emph>Cicero</emph> did herein so excell, that lightly he

as iust praise ariseth by this part, so I doubt not but the

ordeined for safegard.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subsection" n="Of the figure Amplification."><head>Of the figure Amplification.</head>
<p>AMong all the figures of <emph>Rhetorique</emph>, there is no one that
so much helpeth forward an Oration, and beautifieth the
same with such delightfull ornaments, as doth amplification.
For if either wee purpose to make our tale appeare vehement,
to seeme pleasant, or to be well storied with copie: needes
must it be that here we seeke helpe, where helpe chiefly is to
be had, and not els where.  And now because none shal better
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Amplification.</note>
be able to amplifie any matter, then those which best can
praise, or most dispraise any thing here vpon earth, I thinke it
needfull first of all, to gather such thinges together which helpe
best this way.  Therefore in praising or dispraising, wee
must bee well stored euer with such good sentences, as are often
vsed in this our life, the which thorowe arte beeing increased,
helpe much to perswasion.  As for example, where it is saied
(gentle behauiour winneth good will, and clerely quencheth
hatered) I might in commending a noble Gentleman for his
lowlinesse, declare at large how commendable and how<reg orig="profit-able">profitable</reg>
a thing gentle behauiour is, and of the other side, how
hatefull and how harmefull a proude disdainfull man is, and
how beastly a nature he hath, that being but a man, thinketh
himselfe better then any other man is, &amp; also ouer good to
 haue a match or fellowe in this life.  As thus, if lowlinesse
and charitie maintaine life, what a beast is he that through

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Lowlinesse.</note>
hatered will purchase death?  If God warneth vs to loue one
an other, and learne of him to bee gentle, because he was
gentle and humble in heart: How cruell are they that dare
withstande his Commaundement?  If the Subiect rebell
against his King, wee crye with one voyce, hang him, hang
him, and shall we not think him worthie the vilest death of all,
that being a creature, contemneth his Creatour, being a
mortall man, neglecteth his heauenly maker, beeing a vilde
moulde of Clay, setteth light by so mightie a GOD, and
euer liuing King?  Beastes and birdes without reason loue one

<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">117</fw>

an other, they shroude and they flocke together, and shall
men endued with such giftes, hate his euen Christian, and
eschue companie?  When Sheepe doe stray, or Cattell do
striue one against an other, there are Dogges readie to call
them in: yea, they will bite them (as it hath beene full often
seene) if two fight together: and shall man want reason, to
barke against his lewde affections, or at the least shall he haue
none to checke him for his faultes, and force him to forgiue?
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Backbiting</note>
Likewise if you would rebuke one that giueth eare to<reg orig="back-biters">backbiters</reg>
and slaunderers, you must declare what a great
mischiefe an euill tongue is, what a poyson it is, yea, what
a murder to take a mans good name from him.  We coumpt
him worthie death, that poysoneth a mans bodie, and shall
not he suffer the like paine, that poysoneth a mans honestie,
and seeketh to obscure and darken his estimation?  Men be
wel excepted among the wise, not for their bodies, but for
their vertues.  Now take away the thing whereby men are
commended: and what are men other then brute beastes?
For beastes doe nothing against Nature, but he that goeth
against honestie, the same man fighteth against Nature,
which would that all men should liue well.  When a man is
killed secretly, we aske iudgement for the offendour, and shal
they escape without iudgement, that couertly murther a mans
soule?  That separate him from God, that iudge him to Hell,
whose life hath euer been most heauenly?  When our purse
is picked, we make straight search for it againe, and imprison
the offender, and shall we not seeke recouerie of our good
name, when euill tongues haue stained it?  If our fame be
more prise, then is either Golde or groates, what meane wee
to bee so carelesse in keeping the one, and so carefull in
keeping the other?  Fond is his purpose, that being in the
Raine, casteth his garment in a bush, and standeth naked
himself, for sauing the glosse of his gay coate.  And yet
what other thing doe they, that esteeme the losse of money for
great lack, &amp; compt not the losse of their honestie for any want
at all?  Thus we see, that from vertue, and vice, such
amplifications may be made, and no doubt he that can praise,
or dispraise any thing plentifully, is able most copiously to
exaggerate any matter.</p>

He might bring in these sentences with him, and giue great

such things as are notable in this life.  Of the first, these
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Prouerbes alledged

may bee examples.  In lamenting the miserie of Wardships,
I might say, it is not for nought, so commonly saied: I will
handle you like a Warde.  She is a steppe mother to me,
that is to say, she is not a naturall mother: who is worse shod
then the Shoomakers wife?  That is to say: Gentlemens
children full oft are kept but meanly.  Trot sire, and trot
damme, how should the Fole amble, that is, when both father
and mother were nought, it is not like that the childe will
proue good, without an especiall grace of God.</p>

<p>Likerish of tongue, light of taile: That is, he or she that
will fare daintely, will oft liue full wantonlie.  Sone ripe,
sone rotten.  Honour chaungeth maners.  Enough is as good
as a feast.  It is an euill Cooke, that cannot licke his owne

what neede I heape all these together, seeing Heywooddes
Prouerbes are in Print, where plenty are to be had: whose

A yong childe as sober, as a man of fiftie yeares.  A woman
that hath had twentie and fower children.  A man once
worth three or fower thousand pound, now not worth a
groate.  A young man fairer then a woman.  A woman that
hath had seuen or eight husbands.  A man able to drawe
a yarde in his Bowe, besides the feathers.  A man merie
now, and dead within halfe an hower after.  There is none
of all these, but serue much to make our talke appeare
vehement, and encrease the weight of communication.  As
for example.  If one would perswade an olde man to
contemne the vanities of this world, he might vse the examples
of sodaine death, and shewe that children haue died in their
mothers lappe, some in their Cradle, some striplinges, some
elder, and that not one among a thousand commeth to three
score yeares.  Or bee it that some liue an hundred yeares,
beyond the which, not one in this last age passeth.  What is
there in this life, for the which any man should desire to
liue long, seeing that old age bringeth this onely commoditie
with it, that by long liuing we see many things that wee
would not see, and that many a man hath shortened his life,
for wearinesse of this wretched worlde.  Or what though
some pleasures are to be had in this life, what are they all to
the pleasures of the life to come?  Likewise in speaking of
euill happe, I might bring him in that was once worth three
thousand pounde, and is not now worth three groates, and
perswade men either to set light by riches, or els to comfort
them, and perswade them not to take thought, seeing great
harme happened to other heretofore, and time may come
when God will send better.  These sentences aboue rehearsed,
being largely amplified, encrease much any such kinde of
matter.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subsection" n="What is Amplification[?]"><head>What is Amplification[?]</head>
<p>AMplification is a figure in <emph>Rhetorique</emph>, which consisteth
most in augmenting, and diminishing of any matter, and
that diuers waies.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subsection" n="The deuision of amplification."><head>The deuision of amplification.</head>
<p>AMplification and diminishing, either is taken out of the
substances in thinges, or els of wordes.  Out of the
substances and matter affections are deruied: out of wordes
such kindes of amplifications as I will now shewe, and partly

<pb n="121"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">121</fw>

haue shewed before, when I spake of the conclusion, or lapping
vp of any matter.</p>

<p>The first kinde of amplification is, when by changing
a word, in augmenting wee vse a greater, but in diminishing,
wee vse a lesse.  Of the first this may bee an example.  When
I see one sore beaten, to say he is slaine: to call a naughtie
fellowe theefe, or hangman, when he is not knowne to be any
such.  To call a woman that hath made a scape, a common
Harlot: to call an Alehouse haunter a dronkard: to call
one that is troubled with Choler and often angrie, a mad man:
to call a pleasaunt Gentleman, a rayling Iester: to call a
couetous man a Deuill.</p>

<p>Or the latter, these examples shalbe: when one hath sore
beaten his fellow, for the same man to say, that he hath scant
touched him.  When one hath sore wounded an other, to say
he hurt him but a little: when one is sore sicke, to bee said
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Diminution.</note>
he is a little crased.  In like maner also, when wee giue vices
the names of vertues: as when I call him that is a cruell or
mercilesse man, somewhat sore in iudgement.  When I call a
naturall foole, a plaine simple man: when I call a notable
flatterer, a faire spoken man: a glutton, a good fellowe at his
Table: a spendall, a liberall Gentleman: A snudge or pinch
penie, a good husband, a thriftie man.</p>

<p>Now in all these kindes, where wordes are amplified they
seeme much greater, if by correction the sentence be vttered,
and greater wordes compared with them, for whom they
are vttered.  In the which kinde of speech, we shall seeme as
though we went vp by stayers, not only to the toppe of
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Correction.</note>
a thing, but also aboue the top.  There is an example here of
in the seuenth action that <emph>Tullie</emph> made against <emph>Verres</emph>.  It is
an offence, to binde a Citezein of Roome with chaines, it is
an hainous deede to whip him: it is worse then manslaughter
to kill him, what shall I call it to hang him vp vpon a Gibbet?
If one would commende the aucthoritie, which he alledgeth,
he might say thus.  These wordes are no fables vttered
among men, but an assured trueth left vnto vs by writing,
and yet not by any common writing, but by such as all the
world hath confirmed and agreed vpon, that it is autentique
and canonicall: neither are they the words of one that is the
common sort, but they are the wordes of a Doctor in the

<pb n="122"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">122</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

Church of God, and yet not the wordes of a Deuine, or
Doctor of the common sort, but of an Apostle: and yet
not one that is the worst, but of Paule that is the best of all
other: and yet not Paules, but rather the words of the holy
Ghost, speaking by the mouth of Paule.  He that loueth to
enlarge by this kinde, must marke well the circumstaunces of
thinges, and heaping them altogether, hee shall with ease
espie how one thing riseth aboue an other.  And because the
vse hereof extendeth largely, I will largely vse examples.  As
thus.  If a Gentleman &amp; an officer of the Kings, being<reg orig="ouer-charged">ouercharged</reg>
at Supper with ouer much drinke, and surfetting with
gorge vpon gorge, should vomite the next day in the
Parliament house: I might enueigh thus: O shamefull deede,
not onely in sight to be lothed, but also odious of all men to
be heard.  If thou haddest done this deede at thine house,
being at Supper with thy wife and children, who would not
haue thought it a filthie deed?  But now for thee to doe it
in the Parliament house, among so many Gentlemen, and
such, yea, the best in all England, beeing both an Officer of
the Kings, and a man of much authoritie, and there to cast
out gobbettes (where belching were thought great shame) yea
and such gobbets as none could abide the smell, and to fill
the whole house with euill fauour, and thy whole bosome with
much filthines, what an abhominable shame is it aboue all
other?  It had beene a foule deede of it selfe, to vomite
where no such gentlemen were: yea, where no gentlemen
were: yea where no English men were: yea, where no men
were: yea, where no companie were at all: or it had beene
euill, if he had borne no maner of office, or had beene no
publique officer, or had not bene the Kings officer: but being
not onely an officer, but a publique officer, and that the
Kings officer: yea, and such a Kings, and doing such
a deede: I cannot tell in the world, what to say to him.
Diuers examples may bee inuented like vnto this.  As thus,
against an hedd Officer in a Noble mans house, I might
enueigh thus.  Now Lord, what a man is he, he was not
ashamed being a Gentleman, yea, a man of good yeares, and
much aucthoritie, and the hedd Officer of a Dukes house, to
play at Dice in an Alehouse with boyes, bawdes and verlets.
It had beene a great fault to play at so vile a game among

<pb n="123"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">123</fw>

such vile persons, being not Gentleman, being no officer,
being not of such yeares: but being both a man of faire
Lands, of an auncient house, of great aucthoritie, an Officer
of a Duke, yea, and to such a Duke, and a man of such yeares,
that his white heares should warne him to auoyd al such
follie, to play at such a game with such Roysters and such
verlets, yea, and that in such an house as none comes thither
but Theeues, Bawdes, and Ruffians: now before God, I
cannot speake shame enough on him.</p>

<p>There is an other kinde of Amplification, when vnto the
hiest there is added some thing higher then it is.  As thus.
There is no better Preacher among them all, except <emph>Hugh
Latimer</emph>, the Father of al Preachers.  There is no better
Latine man within England, except <emph>Gualter Haddon</emph> the
Lawyer.  Againe, we amplifie a matter not ascending by
degrees, but speaking that thing onely, then the which no
greater thing can be spoken.  As thus.  Thou hast killed
thine owne Mother, what shall I say more, thou hast killed
thine owne Mother.  Thou hast deceiued thy Soueraigne
Lorde and King, what shall I say more, thou hast deceiued thy
Soueraigne Lord and King.</p>

<p>Sometime we amplifie by comparing, and take our ground
vpon the weakest and least, the which if they seeme great, then
must that needes appeare great, which wee would amplifie
and increase.  As <emph>Tullie</emph> against <emph>Catiline</emph>.  My seruaunts in
good soth, if they feared me in such sort, as all the Citizens
doe feare thee: I would thinke it best for me to forsake my
house.  Thus by vsing the least first, this sentence is increased,
fewe seruaunts are compared with all the Citizens, bondmen
are compared with free men: <emph>Tullie</emph> their Maister, is compared
with <emph>Catiline</emph> the Traytour, which was neither Lorde nor
ruler ouer the Citizeins: and <emph>Tullies</emph> house is compared with
the Citie.</p>

<p>By comparing of examples, we vse also to encrease our
matter.  As thus.  Did the Maior of London thrust through
Iacke Strawe, being but a verlet rebell, and onely disquieting
the Citie: and shal the King suffer Captaine Kete to liue in
Englands ground, and enioye the fruites of the Realme,
being a most tyrannous Traytour, and such a Rebell as
sought to ouerthrowe the whole Realme.</p>

<pb n="124"/>
<p><fw place="top-left" type="pageno">124</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
</p>
<p>Here is Iacke Strawe compared with Captain Kete, the
Citie of London with the whole Realme, the Maior with the
King.  So that if he which is a priuate person, and hath no
power of death, might punish with death the disquieting of a
Citie: the King himselfe hauing all power in his hand, maie
iustly punish him, that seeketh to ouerthrowe his whole
Realme.</p>

<p>The places of <emph>Logique</emph> helpe oft for Amplification.  As
where men haue a wrong opinion, and thinke Theft a greater
fault than slaunder, one might proue the contrarie, as well by
circumstaunces, as by arguments.  And first he might shewe
that slaunder is Theft, and euery slaunderer is a Theefe.  For
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Slaunder a greater
offence then Theft.</note>
as well the slaunderer as the Theefe, doe take away an other
mans possession against the owners will.  After that he might
shewe, that a slaunderer is worse then any Theefe, because
a good name is better then all the goodes in the world, and
that the losse of money may be recouered, but the losse of
a mans good name, cannot bee called backe againe, and
a Theefe may restore that againe, which he hath taken away,
but a slaunderer cannot giue a man his good name againe,
which he hath taken from him.  Againe, he that stealeth
goodes or cattell, robbes onely but one man, but an euill
tongued man infecteth all their mindes: vnto whose eares
this report shall come.</p>

<p>Besides this, there are Lawes and remedies to subdue
Theeues: but there is no lawe against an euill tongue.
Againe, al such hainous offences, are euer the more greuously
punished, the more closely and more craftely they are
committed.  As it is thought a greater fault to kill one with
poyson, then to kill him with the sworde, and a more hainous
offence to commit murther, then to commit manslaughter:
wee may gather an argument also from the instrument or
maner of doing.  As a theefe hath done this offence with
his hande, a slaunderer hath done it with his tongue.  Againe,
by the iudgement of all men, enchauntment is a notable euil:
but they that infect a Prince or King with wicked counsail,
are not they more wicked enchaunters, considering they doe
as much, as if one should poyson a Conduite head, or a Riuer,
from whence all men fetch their water.  And yet they doe
more, for it is a greater fault to poyson the minde, then the

<pb n="125"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">125</fw>

bodie.  Thus by the places and circumstaunces, great matters
might be made.</p>

<p>By contraries set together, things oftentimes appearre
greater.  As if one should set Lukes Veluet against Geane
Veluet, the Lukes will appeare better, and the Geane will
seeme worser.  Or set a faire woman against a foule, and she
shal seeme much the fairer, and the other much the fouler.
According whereunto there is a saying in <emph>Logique: Contraria
inter se opposita magis elucescunt</emph>.  That is to say. <reg orig="Con-traries">Contraries</reg>
being set the one against the other, appeare more
euident.  Therfore, if any one be disposed to set forth
chastitie, he may bring in of the contrary part whoredome,
and shewe what a foule offence it is to liue so vncleanly, and
then the deformitie of whoredome, shall much set forth
chastitie: or if one bee disposed to perswade his fellowe to
learning and knowledge, he may shewe of the contrarie, what
a naked wretch man is: yea, how much a man is no man,
and the life no life, when learning once wanteth.  The like
helpe we maie haue by comparing like examples together,
either of creatures liuing or of thinges not liuing: as in
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Storkes.</note>
speaking of constancie, to shewe the Sunne, who euer keepeth
one course: in speaking of inconstancie, to shewe the Moone
which keepeth no certaine course.  Againe, in young
Storkes, we may take an example of loue towards their
damme, for when she is old, and not able for her crooked bill
to picke meate, the yong ones feede her.  In yong Vipers
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Vipers.</note>
there is a contrary example (for as <emph>Plinie</emph> saieth) they eate out
their dammes wombe, and so come forth.  In Hennes there
is a care to bring vp their Chickens: in Egles the contrary,
which cast out their Egges, if they haue any moe then three:
and all because they would not be troubled with bringing vp
of many.</p>

<p>There is also a notable kinde of amplification, when we
would extenuate and make lesse great faultes, which before
wee did largely increase: to the ende that other faultes might
seeme the greatest aboue all other.  As if one had robbed his
Maister, thrust his fellowe through the arme, accompanied
with Harlots, kept the Tauerne till he had bene as dronke
as a Ratte.  To say after a large Inuectiue, against all these
offences.  You haue heard a whole Court role of Ribaudrie,

<pb n="126"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">126</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

and yet all these are but flea bitings, in respect and<reg orig="compari-son">comparison</reg>
of that, which I shal now shew you.  Who doth not
looke for marueilous great matter, and a most hainous offence,
when these faultes that are thought most greeuous, are
coumpted but flea bytings, in respect and comparison of
that, which he mindeth to rehearse?  In like maner one
might exhort the people to godlinesse, and whereas he hath
set forth all the commodities that followe the same, as in
shewing a quiet conscience, not giltie of any great fault, the
libertie of the Spirite, the peace which we haue with GOD,
the fellowshippe with all the elect, for the seruaunt of Sathan,
to bee the sonne of God, the comfort of the soule, the<reg orig="great-nesse">greatnesse</reg>
whereof no man is able to conceiue: to say at length,
and what can be greater, what can be more excellent, or more
blisfull?  And yet al these are small matters, if they be
compared with the blessed inheritaunce of the euer liuing
God, prepared for all those that liue godly here vpon earth,
fastning their whole trust vpon Christ aboue, which both is
able, and will saue all those, that call vnto him with faith.
We doe encrease our cause by reasoning the matter, and
casting our accoumpt, when either by things that followe, or
by thinges that goe before, or els by such things as are
annexed with the matter, wee giue sentence how great the
thing is.  By thinges going before, I iudge when I see an
enuious or hastie man, fight with an other as hastie, that
there is like to bee bloudshed.  As who should say, can
enuious or hastie men match together, but that they must
needes trie the matter with bloudshedding.  Assuredly it
cannot be otherwise, but that blood must appease their rage.
Likewise, seing two wise men earnestly talking together,
I cannot otherwise iudge, but that their talke must needes bee
wittie, and concerne some weightie matter.  For to what
ende should wise men ioyne, or wherefore should they laie
their heddes together, if it were not for some earnest cause?
What a shame is it for a strong man, of much health, and
great manhood, to be ouercome with a cuppe of drinke.
From thinges ioyned with the cause, thus.  A woman hauing
her housband emprisoned, and in daunger of death, sodainly
stept before the King and craued his pardon.  Bold was that
woman, which durst aduenture to kneele before a King,

<pb n="127"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">127</fw>

whose housband had so greeuously offended.  Though women
by nature are fearefull, yet in her appeared a manly stomacke,
and a good bolde harte, yea, euen in greatest daunger.  By
thinges that followe, thus.  All England lament the death of
Duke Henry, and Duke Charles, two noble brethren of the
house of Suffolk.  Then may we well iudge that these two
Gentlemen, were wonderfully beloued, when they both were
so lamented.</p>

<p>There is a kinde of amplifying, when in speaking of two
that fought together, we praise him much that had the worse,
because we would the other to haue more praise.  Considering
for a man to beate a boye, it were no praise, but for a tall
man to match with an other, that were as tall as him self:
that were somwhat worth.  Therefore, I would haue the
Scottes well praised, whom the Englishmen haue so often
vanquished.  He that praiseth much the strong holde of
Boleine, must needes thereby praise King Henry the eight of
Englande, who by Martiall power wonne it, and kept it all
his life tyme.  Or thus: such a one keepes a marueilous good
house, for the worst boye in his house, drinkes one and the
same drinke with his Maister: and all one bread, yea, euery
one hath his meate in siluer, Chamber vessels, and all are of
siluer.  Wee iudge by Apparell, by Armour, or by harnesse,
what a man is of stature or bignesse.  We iudge by occasion
the goodnes of men, as when they might haue done harme,
they would not: when they might haue slaine, they sought
rather to saue.  From the place were one is, encrease may be
gathered.  As thus.  Being euen in the Court he was neuer
moued to gaming: being at Rome, he hated Harlots, where
there is by report, so great plentie as there are starres in the
Element.</p>

<p>From the time thus, hee must needes bee well learned in
the lawes of our Realme, that hath bene a student this thirtie
Winter.</p>

<p>From the age: assuredly, he is like to be good, for being
but a childe he was euer most Godly.</p>

<p>From the state of life: no doubt but he is honest, for being
but a seruaunt, he liued so vprightly, as none could iustly
blame his life.</p>

<p>From the hardnesse of a thing.  That which is almost

<pb n="128"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">128</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

onely proper to Angels, must needes be hard for man:
therefore, Chastitie is a rare gift, and hard for man to keepe.</p>

<p>From the straightnesse of a thing.  Eloquence must needes
be a wonderfull thing, when so fewe haue attained it.</p>

<p>Likewise, notable aduentures done by a fewe, are more
praise worthie, then such as haue bene done by a great
number.  Therefore, the battaile of Muskelborowe, against
the Scottes, where so fewe Englishmen were slaine, and so
many Scottes dispatched: must needes be more praise worthie,
then if the nomber of Englishmen had bene greater.</p>

<p>Vehemencie of words, full often helpe the matter forwardes
when more is gathered by cogitation, then if the thing had
bene spoken in plaine wordes.  When we heare one saie,
such a man swelled, seeing a thing against his minde, we
gather that he was then more then halfe angry.  Againe,
when we heare one say, such a woman spittes fire, we gather
straight that she is a deuill.  The Preacher thundered in the
Pulpit, belike then he was meetely hotte.  But concerning all
such speeches, the knowledge of a Metaphore, shall bring men
to much knowledge, whereof I wil speake hereafter among
the figures: and therefore, I surcease to speake of it in this
place.</p>

<p>We encrease our cause, by heaping of words and sentences
together, touching many reasons into one corner, which
before were scattered abroade, to the intent that our talke
might appere more vehement.  As when by many coniectures
and greate presumptions, we gather that one is an offendour,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Amplification
by coniectures.</note>
heaping them all into one plumpe, which before were sparpled
abroade, and therefore did but little good.  As thus: to
proue by coniectures, a murder committed, I might thus say,
against a suspected person.  My Lordes, doe not weye my
wordes and sentences seuerally, but consider them altogether.
If the accused person here, shal receiue profite by this other
mans death, if his life heretofore hath euer been euill, his
nature couetous, his wealth most slender, and that this dead
mans goods could turne to no mans auaile so much, as vnto
this accused person, and that no man could so easily dispatch
hym, and that this man could by no better meanes compasse
his desire, and that nothing hath beene vnattempted, which
might further his naughtie purpose, and nothing done, that

<pb n="129"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">129</fw>

was thought needlesse, and seeing a meete place, was chiefly
sought for, and occasion serued very well, and the tyme was
most apt for such an attempt, and many meanes heretofore
deuised to compasse this offence, and great hope both to
keepe it close, and also to dispatche it, and besides that,
seeing this man was seene alone, a little before in the same
place where this other man was slaine, and that this mans
voyce which did slaie hym was heard a little before in the
same place, where this other man was slain, and seeing it is well
knowne that this man came home late the same night, and
the next day after being examined, did answere confusedly,
fearefully, and as though he were amased, and seeing all these
things are partly shewed by witnesses, partly by good reason,
partly by his owne confession, and partly by the reporte that
commonly goeth of hym, which by like is not spoken without
some ground: It shall be your partes, worthy Iudges, weying
all these things together, to giue certaine iudgement of him
for his offence, and not to thinke it a matter of suspition.
For it might haue been, that three or fower of these<reg orig="con-iectures">coniectures</reg>
beeing prooued, might giue but only a cause of
suspition, but whereas al these together are plainly proued by
him, it can not be otherwise but that he hath offended.</p>

<p>It is an excellent kinde of amplifying, when things encreased,
and things diminished, are both sette together, that the one
may the rather beautifie the other.  As if, when Gods<reg orig="good-nesse">goodnesse</reg>
towards vs, were largely amplified, wee did straight
extenuate our vnthankfulnesse towards him againe.  As thus:
Seing God hath made man a creature vnto his owne likenesse,
seeing he hath giuen him life, and the spirite of vnderstanding,
endewing hym with his manifold graces, &amp; redeming him,
not with vile money, but with his owne precious body,
suffering death, and blouddsheding vppon the Crosse, the
rather that man might liue for euer: what an vnthankfull
part is it, yea, what an hainous thing it is for man so oft to
offende, so oft to wallowe in such his wickednesse, and
euermore for Gods louing kindnesse, to shewe himselfe of all
other creatures most vnkinde.</p>

<p>Likewise, contraries being rehearsed, and the euill<reg orig="im-mediatly">immediatly</reg>
vttered after the good, make much for encrease.
As many men now a daies for Sobrietie, follow Gluttonie:

<pb n="130"/>

<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

for Chastitie, take Lecherie: for trueth, like falshood: for
gentlenesse, seeke crueltie: for Iustice, vse wrong dealing:
for Heauen, Hel: for God, the Deuill: to whom they will
without peraduenture, if Gods grace be not greater.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subsection" n="Of mouing affections."><head>Of mouing affections.</head>
<p>BEcause the beautie of amplifying, standeth most in apt
mouing of affections: It is needfull to speake somewhat
in this behalfe, that the better it may be knowen what they
are, and howe it may bee vsed.  Affections therefore (called
Passions) are none other thing, but a stirring or forsing of the
minde, either to desire, or els to detest and loth any thing,
more vehemently then by nature we are commonly wont to doe.
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Affections
mouing.</note>
We desire those things, we loue them, and like them earnestly,
that appeare in our iudgement to be godly: wee hate and
abhorre those things that seeme naught, vngodly, or harmefull
vnto vs.  Neither onely are wee moued with those things, which
wee thinke either hurtfull, or profitable for our selues, but also
we reioyce, we be sorie, or wee pittie an other mans happe.</p>

<p>And euermore there are two things, which mooue vs either
this waie, or that waie.  The matter selfe which doth happen,
or is like to happen: and the person also whom the matter
doth concerne.  As for example: If a wicked wretch haue
his desertes, we are all glad to heare it, but if an innocent
should be cast awaie, we thinke much of it, and in stomacke
repine against wrong iudgement.  If an euill man finde much
fauour, we enuie his good hap, yea, it greeueth vs, that any
one such, should haue such fauour shewed: and not onely
doe we hate the euill that are come to any wealth, but also
we enuie commonly all such as come to any preferment,
especially, if either they haue bene as poore men as we are,
or els came of a meaner house then we haue done.  Noe one
man would haue any to be better then himself, and euery one
enhableth his owne gooddes, to deserue like dignitie with the
best.  And where as some haue gotte before, starting sodainly
from an inch to an ell, we spare not to say, that flatterie
made them speed, and though they haue much goodes, yet
are they clere voyde of all goodnesse, and therefore much
good may it do them, we would not come by goodes in such
sort, to winne all the worlde.  For the deuill and they (say
wee) shall part stakes with them one day.  And thus we can

<pb n="131"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">131</fw>

neuer be content to giue our neighbour a good worde.  Yea,
though they haue serued right well, and deserued a greater
reward, wee must needes finde some fault with them to lessen
their praises, and say that though their desertes be greate,
yet their natures are nought: none so proude, though fewe
bee so hardie, none so enuious, though few so faithful: none
so couetous though fewe so liberall: none so gluttonous, though
fewe keepe such an house.  And thus, though we graunt them one
thing, yet we will take an other thing as fast againe from them.</p>

<p>Such a man is an excellent fellow (saith one) he can speake
the tongues well, he plaies of Instruments, fewe men better,
he feigneth to the Lute, marueilous sweetely, he endites
excellently, but for all this (the more is the pitie) he hath his
faultes, he wil be dronke once a day, he loues women well,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">With<reg orig="pray-sing,">praysing,</reg>
dispraysing vsed.</note>
he will spend Gods Coope if he had it, he will not tary long
in one place, and he is somewhat large of his tongue.  That
if these faultes were not, surely he were an excellent fellowe.
Euen as one should saie: if it were not for lying and stealing,
there were not an honester man then such a one is, that
perchaunce hath some one good qualitie to set him forward.
These buttes be too broade, and these barres be ouer bigge,
for looke what is giuen to one by commending, the same is
straight taken away by butting.  Therefore, such are not to
bee liked that giue a man a shoulder of Mutton, and breake
his head with the Spitte when they haue done.  And yet, this
is many a mans nature, especially, where enuie hath any
grounded dwelling place, whose propertie is alwaies to speake
nothing of other, without reproach and slaunder.</p>

<p>In mouing affections, and stirring the Iudges to be greeued,
the waight of the matter must be set forth, as though they
sawe it plaine before their eyes, the report must be such, and
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Description of an

the offence made so hainous, that the like hath not bene seen

together: The naughtinesse of his nature that did the deede,
the cruell ordering, the wicked dealing, and malicious<reg orig="hand-ling">handling</reg>,
the tyme, the place, the maner of his doing, and the
wickednesse of his will to haue done more.  The man that
sustained the wrong, how litle he deserued, how well hee was

how great lack men haue of him.  Now, if this be not

thinke him worthie to haue the lesse fauour.  If a sturdie

a childe, a woman, an aged man, a good man, or a chiefe
officer, should be euil vsed.  If the offence be committed

<p>NOW in mouing pitie, and stirring men to mercie,
the wrong done, must first be plainly tolde: or if the
Iudges haue sustained the like extremitie, the best were to wil
them, to remember their owne state, how they haue bene
abused in like maner, what wrongs they haue suffered by
wicked doers: that by hearing their owne, they may the
better harken to others.</p>

<p>Againe, whereas all other miseries that befall vnto man,
are greeuous to the eare, there is nothing more hainous, then
to heare that the most honest men are sonest ouerthrowen, by
them that are most wicked, and vertue put to flight through
the only might of vice.  That if the like hath not happened
vnto the hearers of this cause, yet it were meete to shewe
them that the like may happen, and so require them to giue
iudgement in this cause, as they would do in their owne, and
remember that harme may chaunce to euery one, that<reg orig="per-happes">perhappes</reg>

Neither can any good bee done at all, when wee haue sayd

misfortune of the thing, or in fearing much, the like euill

sorte, that the matter may appeare, both more greeuous to
the eare, and therewith so hainous, that it requires earnestly
a speedie reformation?  There is no substaunce of it selfe,
that wil take fire, except ye put fire to it.  Likewise, no
mans nature is so apt, straight to be heated, except the
Oratour himselfe, be on fire, and bring his heate with him.
It is a common saying, nothing kindleth soner than fire.

And therefore a fierie stomacke causeth euermore a fierie
tongue.  And he that is heated with zeale and godlinesse,
shall set other on fire with like affection.  No one man can
better enueigh against vice, then he can do which hateth vice
with all his heart.  Againe, nothing moisteth soner then
water.  Therefore, a weeping eye causeth much moisture,
and prouoketh teares.  Neither is it any maruaile, for such
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">A weeping eye

moysture.</note>
men, both in their countenaunce, tongue, eyes, gesture, and
in all their bodie els, declare an outward griefe, and with
wordes so vehemently and vnfeinedly sets it forward, that
they will force a man to be sory with them, and take part
with their teares euen against his wil.  Notwithstanding
when such affections are moued, it were good not to stand
long in them.  For though a vehement talke may mooue
teares, yet no arte can long holde them.  For as <emph>Cicero</emph> doth
say, nothing drieth soner then teares, especially when we
lament an other mans cause, and be sorie with him for
his sake.</p>

<p>But now that I haue taught men to be sorie, I will attempt
againe to make them merie, and shewe what learned men
saie, concerning laughter, in deliting the hearers, when tyme
and place shall best require.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subsection" n="Of deliting the hearers, and stirring them to laughter."><head>Of deliting the hearers, and stirring them to laughter.</head>
<p>COnsidering the dulnesse of mans Nature, that neither it
can be attentiue to heare, nor yet stirred to like or alow
any tale long told, except it be refreashed, or finde some
sweete delite: the learned haue by witte and labour, deuised
much varietie.  Therefore, sometimes in telling a waightie
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Laughter mouing.</note>
matter, they bring in some heauie tale, and moue them to be
right sorie, whereby the hearers are more attentiue.  But
after when they are wearied, either with tediousnesse of the
matter, or heauinesse of the report: some pleasaunt matter
is inuented, both to quicken them againe, and also to keepe
them from sacietie.  But surely fewe there be that haue this
gift, in due time to cheare men.  Neither can any do it,
whom Nature hath not framed, and giuen an aptnesse
thereunto.</p>

<p>Some mans countenance wil make pastime, though he
speake neuer a worde.  Yea, a foolish worde vttered by an

<pb n="135"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">135</fw>

apt man, or a gesture straungely vsed by some pleasaunt bodie,
settes men full oft vpon a laughter.  And whereas some
thinke it a trifle to haue this gift, and so easie, that euery
varlet or common iesture, is able to matche with the best:
yet it appeareth that they which vtterly can be pleasaunt, and
when time serueth can giue a merie aunswere, or vse a
nipping taunt, shall be able to abashe a right worthie man,
and make him at his wittes ende, through the sodaine quicke,
and vnlooked frumpe giuen.  I haue knowne some so hitte
of the thumbes, that they could not tell in the world, whether
it were best to fight, chide, or to goe their way.  And no
maruaile: for where the iest is aptly applied, the hearers
laugh immediatly, and who would gladly bee laughed to
scorne?  Some can pretely by a worde spoken, take occasion
to be right merie.</p>

<p>Other can iest at large, and tell a rounde tale pleasauntly,
though they haue none occasion at that time giuen.  But
assuredly, that mirth is more worthe, which is moued by
a worde newly spoken, then if a long tale should pleasauntly be
tolde.  For as much, as both it cometh vnlooked for, and
also declares a quicknesse of witte, worthie commendation.
There are fiue thinges which <emph>Tullie</emph> noteth, concerning
pleasaunt talke.
<list type="simple">
<item n="i">What it is to delite the hearers.</item>

<item n="iiii">How largely he may goe, and what measure hee must vse.</item>
<item n="v">What are the kindes of sporting, or mouing to laughter.</item>
</list></p>
<p>NOw to tell you in plaine words, what laughter is, how
it stirreth and occupieth the whole body, how it altereth
the countenance, &amp; sodainly brasteth out that we cannot
keepe it in: let some mery man on Gods name take this
matter in hand: for it passeth my cunning, &amp; I think euen
thei that can best moue laughter, would rather laugh merily
when such a question is put forth, then giue answere earnestly,
what, &amp; how laughter is in deed.</p>

<p>The occasion of laughter, and the meane that maketh vs
mery (which is the second obseruation) is the fondnes, the

<pb n="136"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">136</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

filthines, the deformitie, and all such euill behauiour, as we
see to be in other.  For we laugh alwaies at those things,
which either onely or chiefly touch handsomely, and wittely,
some especiall fault, or fond behauiour in some one body, or
some one thing.  Somtimes we iest at a mans bodie, that is
not well proportioned, and laugh at his countenance, if
either it be not comely by nature, or els he through folly
can not well see it.  For if his talke be fond, a mery man can
want no matter to hitte him home, ye may bee assured.
Some iest is made, when it toucheth no man at all, neither
the demaunder, neither the standers by, nor yet any other,
and yet deliteth as much the hearers, as any the other can
doe.  Now when we would abashe a man, for some words
that he hath spoken, and can take none aduauntage of his
person, or making of his bodie, we either doult him at the
first, and make him beleeue, that he is no wiser then a
Goose: or els we confute wholy his sayings with some
pleasaunt iest, or els we extenuate and diminish his doings
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Mirth how many
waies it is moued.</note>
by some pretie meanes, or els we cast the like in his dish, and
with some other deuise, dash hym out of countenance: or last
of all, we laugh him to scorne out right, and sometimes
speake almost neuer a word, but onely in continuaunce,
shewe our selues pleasaunt.  But howsoeuer we make sporte,
either the delite is vttered by countenance, or by pointing to
some thing, or shewed at large by some tale, or els occasion
taken by some word spoken.</p>

<p>The third question is, whether it standeth with an Oratours
profession, to delite the hearers with pleasaunt reportes, and
wittie sayings, or no.  Assuredly it behoueth a man that must
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Preachers.</note>
talke much, euermore to haue regarde to his audience, and
not onely to speake so much as is needfull, but also to speake
no longer then they bee willing to heare.  Euen in this our
tyme, some offende much in tediousnesse, whose part it were
to comfort all men with cherefulnesse.  Yea, the Preachers of
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Platoes<reg orig="say-ing">saying</reg>
to<reg orig="Anti-sthenes.">Antisthenes.</reg></note>
God mind so much edifying of soules, that they often forget
we haue any bodies.  And therfore, some doe not so much
good with telling the trueth, as they doe harme with dulling
the hearers, being so farre gone in their matters, that<reg orig="often-times">oftentimes</reg>
they can not tel when to make an end.  <emph>Plato</emph> therefore
the father of learning, and the Well of all wisedome, when he

<pb n="137"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">137</fw>

heard <emph>Antisthenes</emph> make such a long Oration, that hee starke
wearied al his hearers, phy for shame man (quoth he) doest
thou not knowe, that the measuring of an Oration standeth
not in the speaker, but in the hearers.  But some perhaps
wil saie vnto me, <emph>Facite quantum in vobis est</emph>, to whom I
aunswere, <emph>estote prudentes</emph>.  And now because our senses be
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">1. Peter 5.
Math. 10.</note>
such, that in hearing a right wholsome matter, we either fall
a sleepe when we shoulde most harken, or els are wearied
with still hearing one thing, without any change, and think
that the best part of his tale, resteth in making an ende: the
wittie and learned haue vsed delitefull sayings, and quicke
sentences, euer among their waightie causes, considering that
not onely good will is got thereby (for what is he that loueth
not mirth?) but also men wonder at such a head, as hath
mens hartes at his commaundement, being able to make them
merie when he list, and that by one word speaking, either in
aunswering some thing spoken before, or els oftentimes in
giuing the onset, being not prouoked thereunto.  Againe,
we see that men are full oft abashed, and put out of<reg orig="counten-ance">countenance</reg>
by such taunting meanes, and those that haue so done
are coumpted to be fine men, and pleasaunt fellowes, such as
fewe dare set foote with them.</p>

<p>Thus knowing that to moue sporte, is lawfull for an
Orator, or any one that shall talke in any open assembly:
good it were to knowe what compasse hee should keepe, that
should thus bee merie.  For feare he take too much ground,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Iesting when it
should be spared.</note>
and goe beyond his boundes.  Therefore, no such should be
taunted, or iested withall, that either are notable euill liuers,
and hainous offenders: or els are pitifull catifes, and wretched
beggers.  For euery one thinketh it a better and a meeter
deede, to punish naughtie packes then to scoffe at their euil
demeanour: and as for wretched soules or poore bodies, none
can beare to haue them mocked, but thinke rather that thei
should be pitied, except they foolishly vaunt them selues.
Againe, none such should be made any laughing stockes, that
either are honest of behauiour: or els are generally wel
beloued.  As for other, we may be bolde to talke with them,
and make such game and pastime, as their good wits shal giue
good cause.  But yet this one thing, we had neede euer to
take with vs, that in all our iesting we keepe a meane,

<pb n="138"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">138</fw>

wherein not onely it is meet to auoyd all grosse bourding, and
alehouse iesting, but also to eschue all foolish talke, and
Ruffine maners, such as no honest eares can once abide, nor
yet any wittie man can like well or allowe.</p></div2>

<p>PLeasauntnesse, either appeareth in telling a rounde tale,
or els in taking occasion of some one worde.  The matter
is tolde pleasantly, when some mans nature (whereof the tale
is tolde) is to set forth his countenaunce so counterfeited, and
all his iesture so resembled, that the hearers might iudge the
thing, to be then liuely done, euen as though he were there,
whereof the tale was tolde.  Some can so liuely set foorth an

few shall be able to forbeare laughter, which knowe both
parties, though they would the contrary neuer so faine.
Nowe in counterfeiting after this sorte, if such moderation
be not vsed, that the hearer may iudge more by himsefe, then
the pleasaunt disposed man is willing fully to set foorth: it
will not be well liked.  For, he that exceedeth and telleth all:

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Pleasauntnesse

Pleasauntnesse in a saying, is stirred by the quicke altering
of some one worde, or of some one sentence.  But euen as in
reporting a tale, or counterfeiting a man, to much is euer
naught: So scurrilitie or (to speake in olde plaine English)
knauerie in iesting would not be vsed, where honestie is
esteemed.  Therfore, though there be some witte in a pretie
deuised iest: yet we ought to take heede that we touche not
those, whom we would be most loth to offende.  And yet
some had as leue lose their life, as not bestowe their conceiued
iest, and oftentimes they haue as they desire.  But shall
I saie of such wilfull men, as a Spanyard spake of an earnest
Gospeller, that for words spoken against an Ecclesiasticall

this would first be learned, that out of diuers
pleasaunt speeches, auncient sayings also may be gathered.
As for example, we may by one worde, both praise a faithfull
seruaunt, and if he be naught, we may also iest of him, and
praise him.  According to that merie saying of <emph>Nero</emph>, vpon
his man that was light fingred.  I haue one at home (quoth
he) among all other, to whome there is no coffer lockt, nor
doore shut in all my house, meaning that he was a picklocke,

spoken of a faithfull seruaunt.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Pleasant answeres made

We shall delite the hearers, when they looke for one

one <emph>Pontidius</emph> being sore greeued, that an other man had

Ah Lord, what thinke you sir of him, that was taken in bed

serue well for this purpose being both warriers, as what Pope

charge vnder the Pope of an Armie, and seing it necessarie,
to trie the fortune of battaile, against the enemies of the
Popes holinesse, valiantly encouraged those soldiours, to shew
themselues like men, assuring to them that would hassarde
their liues, in that conflict, not onely to haue full pardone of
their sinnes, but also that they should that morning, goe dine
with GOD and his Angelles in Heauen.  And when he had
thus saied, he withdrew himselfe from the battaile.  Vnto
whom a Soldiour said that was nigh at hand.  Right reuerend

Wordes rehearsed contrarie to that which was spoken, and
(as a man would say) ouerthwartly aunswered, doe much
abash the opponent, and delite the hearers.  As when <emph>Sergius
Galba</emph> being sicke, and therfore keeping his house, had
appointed certaine of his freendes, to heare a matter of one
<emph>Libo Scribonius</emph>, Tribune of the people, a man much noted for
his naughtie and vncleane life: this <emph>Libo</emph> saied to him in this
wise.  Good Lord, when shall we see you sir abroad out of
your Parlour.  Marie (quoth he) when thou keepest thy selfe

familiar with an other mans wife.  Thus we see how and in
what maner pleasaunt sawes are gathered and vsed, vpon the
occasion of diuers wordes spoken.</p>

<p><emph>Alphonsus</emph> King of Naples, had a Iester in his Court, who
made a booke, and kept a reckening of all follies, especially
such as he thought to bee follies, of all those Gentlemen and
others that waited in the Court, wherat the King tooke great
pleasure oftentimes.  And so it happened that the King
hauing a More in his house, sent the same man into Leuant,
with three or fower thousand pound in his purse to buye
horses in <emph>Affrica</emph>.  The Iester seeing this act, did put it in his
Booke of remembraunce for a plaine follie.  Now it happened
that within a little while after, the King asked this Iester for
his booke, because he had not sene it of a long time before.
And in reading vpon his booke, where he found many mery
mad toyes, he hit at length vpon himself &amp; the Moore, vnto
whom he had giuen three thousand pounde, to buye horses for
him in Barbarie.  Whervpon the King somwhat chaunged in
colour, asked him in his anger, why he had put him in his
booke after that sort.  I haue put you in my booke (quoth the
Iester) because you haue plaid the very foole, to giue the
bestowing of so much money to a straunger, whom you shal
neuer see againe.  And what if he come againe (quoth the
King) and bring the horses with him, haue I then plaied the
foole?  Well (quoth the Iester) so sone as he is come, I will
then put out your name out of my booke, and put his name
in your place.  For then I must needes take him to be a more
foole then you are a great deale.  But till he come, you shall
be in my booke, God willing.</p></div2>

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Difference betwixt a
iest in a worde, and
a iest in a long tale.</note>
<p>THE nature and whole course of a matter, beeing largely
set out with a comely behauiour, doth much delite the
hearers, and giueth good cause of great pastime.  This
difference is betwene a iest in a word, and a iest vttered in
a long tale.  That which is still delitefull, with what wordes
soeuer you tell it, is contained in the substance or nature of
a long tale: that which loseth his grace by alteration of
a worde, is contained in the nature of a worde.  They that
can liuely tell pleasaunt tales, and merie deedes done, and set

them out aswell with iesture, as with voyce, leauing nothing
behind, that may serue for beautifying of their matter: are
most meete for this purpose, whereof assuredly there are but
fewe.  And whatsoeuer he is, that can aptly tell his tale, and
with countenaunce, voyce, and iesture so temper his report,
that the hearers may stil take delite: him compt I man
worthie to be highly esteemed.  For vndoubtedly no man
can doe any such thing, except they haue a great mother wit,
&amp; by experience confirme such their comelinesse, wherevpon
by nature they were most apt.  Many a man readeth histories,
heareth Fables, seeth worthie acts done, euen in this our age,
but few can set them out accordingly, and tell them liuely,
as the matter self requireth to be tolde.  The kindes of
deliting in this sort are diuers: whereof I will set forth many,
as hereafter they shall followe.</p></div2>

<div2 type="subsection" n="Sport moued by telling of old tales."><head>Sport moued by telling of old tales.</head>
<p>IF there bee any olde tale or straunge historie, well and
wittely applied to some man liuing, all men loue to heare
it of life.  As if one were called <emph>Arthur</emph>, some good fellowe
that were well acquainted with King <emph>Arthures</emph> booke, and the
Knights of the round Table, would want no matter to make
good sport, and for a neede would dub him Knight of the
round Table, or els proue him to be one of his kinne, or els
(which were much) proue him to be <emph>Arthur</emph> himselfe.  And so
likewise of other names, merie companions would make mad
pastime.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Deformitie of bodie
mooueth mirth.</note>
Oftentimes the deformitie of a mans bodie, giueth matter
enough to bee right merie, or els a Picture in shape like an
other man, will make some to laugh right hartely.  One
being grieued with an other man, saied in his anger, I will
set thee out in thy colours, I will shewe what thou art.  The
other being therewith much chafed, shewe quoth he, what thou
canst: with that hee shewed him, pointing with his finger,
a man with a bottle Nose, blobbe cheeked, and as red as
a Butchers bowle, euen as like the other man, as any one in
al the world could be.  I neede not to say that he was angrie.
An other good fellowe being merily disposed, called his
acquaintance vnto him and saied: Come hether I saie, and
I will shewe thee as very a loute, as euer thou sawest in all
thy life before: with that he offered him at his comming,

a steele Glasse to looke in.  But surely I thinke he looked
a wrie, for if I had bene in his case, I would haue told
him that I espied a much greater loute, before I sawe the
Glasse.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Augmenting or
diminishing.</note>
In augmenting or diminishing without all reason, wee giue
good cause of much pastime.  As <emph>Diogenes</emph> seeing a pretie
towne, hauing a great paire of gates at the comming in:
Take heede quoth he, you men of this towne, least your towne
run out of your gates.  That was a meruailous bigge gate
I trowe, or els a wonderfull little towne, where such passage
should be made.</p>

<p>A Frier disposed to tell misteries, opened to the people that
the soule of man was so little, that a leuen thousand might
dance vpon the naile of his thumbe.  One meruailing much
at that, I pray you maister Frier quoth hee, where shall the
Pyper stande then, when such a number shall keepe so small
a roume.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Opening a weightie
or vnknowne thing.</note>
Mirth is mooued, when vpon a trifle or a word spoken, an
vnknowne matter and weightie affaire is opened.  As if one
should finde fault with some mans sumptuous building, or
other such thing, which had found much fauour at the same
mans hande: an other might say, well sir, he that builded
this house, saued your worshippe from hanging when the time
was.  A necessarie note for him, thankfully to remember the
builder of that house, and not slaunderously to speake euill
of him.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Dissembling.</note>
It is a pleasaunt dissembling, when we speake one thing
merily and thinke an other earnestly: or els when wee praise
that which otherwise deserueth dispraise, to the shaming of
those that are taken not to be most honest.</p>

<p>As in speaking of one that is well knowne to bee naught,
to say among all men that are seen too, there is one that
lacketh his reward.  He is the diligentiest fellowe in his
calling of all other, he hath trauailed in behalfe of his
countrey, he hath watched day and night to further his
Commonweale, and to aduaunce the dignitie thereof, and
shal he goe emptie home?  Who stood by it at such a field,
who plaid the man and cried, stoppe the theefe, when such
a man was robbed?  Who seeth good rule kept in such
a place?  Can any here charge him with bawdrie?  Which

<pb n="147"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">147</fw>

of you al dare say, or can say that euer you sawe him dronken,
if then these be true, ought not such to be seen too: and
rewarded accordingly?  For praising the vnworthy, I<reg orig="remem-ber">remember</reg>
once that our worthie <emph>Latimer</emph>, did set out the Deuill for
his diligence wonderfully, and preferred him for that purpose,
before all the Bishops in England.  And no doubt, the wicked
be more busie and stirring, then the children of light be in
their generation.</p>

<p>What talke you of such a man (saith an other) there is not
an honester man ye may bee assured.  For if a man had neede
of one, he is readie at a pinch, his bodie sweates for honestie,
if you come to him in a hot Sommers day, you shall see his
honestie in such sort to reeke, that it would pitie any
Christian soule liuing.  He hath more honestie with him
then he needes, and therefore both is able and will lende,
where it pleaseth him best.  Beware of him aboue all men
that euer you knewe.  He hath no fellowe, there is none
such.  I thinke he will not liue long, he is so honest a man,
the more pitie that such good fellowes should know what
death meaneth.  But it maketh no matter when he is gone,
al the world will speake of him, his name shal neuer dye, he
is so wel knowne vniuersally.</p>

<p>Thus wee may mockingly speake well of him, when there
is not a noughtier fellowe within al England againe, and euen
as well set out his noughtinesse this way, as though wee had
in very deede vttered al his naughtie conditions plainly, and
without iesting.  Among all that euer were pleasaunt in this
kinde of delite, <emph>Socrates</emph> beareth the name, and may worthely
chalenge praise.  Sir Thomas More with vs here in England,
had an excellent gift, not onely in this kinde, but also in all
other pleasant delites, whose witte euen at this hower, is
a wonder to all the worlde, and shall bee vndoubtedly euen
vnto the worldes ende.  Vnto this kinde of dissembling,
is next adioyning a manner of speech, when we giue an
honest name to an euill deede.  As when I would call one
accordingly, that is of a naughtie behauiour, to say: Ah sirrha,
you are a Marchaunt in deed: where as I think a<reg orig="Mar-chaunts">Marchaunts</reg>
name is honest.  Some old fellowes, when they thinke
one to bee an Heretique, they will say he is a Gospeller.
Some newe fellowes when they thinke one a Papist, they will

<pb n="148"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">148</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

call him streight a Catholique, and bee euen with him at the
lands end.  Contrariwise, some will giue an euil name to
a good thing: As a Father louing his Sonne tenderlie, and
hauing no cause to bee grieued with him, will sometimes say
to him: Come hether sir knaue: and the Mother merelie
being disposed, will say to her sweete Sonne: Ah you little
horesonne, will you serue me so.  Where as I thinke some
women that oft say so, will sweare vpon a booke they are
none such, and almost I had saied, I dare sweare for some of
them my selfe, if God had not forbidden me to sweare
at all.</p>

<p>This kinde also is pretie, when wee gather an other thing
by a mans tale, then he would gladlie wee should gather.
When <emph>Liuius Salinator</emph> a Romaine Captaine, had kept the
Castell of <emph>Tarentum</emph>, losing the Towne to <emph>Hanniball</emph> his enemie,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Q. Fabius Maximus.</note>
and that <emph>Maximus</emph> therevpon had laied siege to the same
Toune, and got it againe by the sword: Then <emph>Salinator</emph>
which thus kept the Castell, desired him to remember, that
through his meanes he got the Towne.  Why should I not
(quoth he) think so: for if you had neuer lost it, I had neuer
got it.</p>

<p>To dissemble sometimes, as though wee vnderstood not
what one meant, declareth an apt wit, and much deliteth
such as heare it.  <emph>Diogenes</emph> was asked on a time, what Wine
he loued best to drinke.  Marie (quoth he) an other mans
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Diogenes.</note>
Wine: meaning that he loued that drinke best that cost him
least.  The same <emph>Diogenes</emph> likewise was asked what one should
giue him, to let him haue a blowe at his head.  Marie
a Helmet, quoth he.</p>

<p>One <emph>Octauius</emph> a <emph>Libian</emph> borne (as witnesseth <emph>Macrobius</emph>) saied
vnto <emph>Tullie</emph>, when he spake his minde vpon a matter.  Sir,
I heare you not, I pray you speake louder.  No? (quoth <emph>Tullie</emph>)
that is a meruaile to me, for as I doe remember, your eares
are well bored through, meaning that he was nailed vpon
a Pillorie, or els had holes made in his eares, which might
serue (as <emph>Tullie</emph> iested) to receiue open aire.</p>

<p>An other being sore offended vpon some cause with a
fellowe, who had lost his eares for good cause, saied in his
heate.  I will handle thee like a knaue, seest thou now.  And
heaping wordes vpon words, would gladly belike that the

<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">149</fw>

partie should haue caried them away, and well remembred
them, and therefore saied fumously vnto him, doest thou heare
me?  Vpon that, one that stood by, said to this angrie
Gentleman, I doubt sir, that this Pillorie fellowe doth not
heare you at all.  For as you remember he lost his eares of
late, and how can he heare that hath no eares at all.  With
that the Gentlemans anger was altered to mirth and laughter,
and so they all departed.</p>

<p>When <emph>Mettellus</emph> tooke Muster, and required <emph>C&aelig;sar</emph> to bee
there, not abyding that he should be absent, though his eyes
grieued him, and said: what man do you see nothing at al?
Yes Mary (quoth <emph>C&aelig;sar</emph>) as euil as I see, I can see a Lordship
of yours (the which was fower or fiue miles from Rome)
declaring that his building was ouer sumptuous, and so houge
withall (much aboue his degree) that a blind man might
almost see it.  Now in those daies ouer costly buildings was
generally hated, because men sought by such meanes to get
fame, &amp; beare rule in the Commonweale.</p>

<p>The like also is of one <emph>Nasica</emph>, who when he came to the
Poet <emph>Ennius</emph>, and asked at the gates if <emph>Ennius</emph> were at home,
the mayd of the house being so commaunded by her maister,
made answere that he was not within.  And when he
perceiued, that she so saied by her maisters commaundement,
he went straight his way, and saied no more.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Ennius pleasaunt
aunswere to Nasica.</note>
Now shortly after when <emph>Ennius</emph> came to <emph>Nasica</emph>, and called
for him at the doore, <emph>Nasica</emph> cried out a loude, and saied:
Sirrha, I am not at home?  What man (quoth <emph>Ennius</emph>) I heare
thee speake.  Doe not I knowe thy voyce?  Then (quoth
<emph>Nasica</emph>.)  Ah shamelesse man that thou art, when I sought
thee at thy home, I did beleeue thy maide, when she saied
thou wast not at home, and wilt not thou beleeue me, when
I tell thee mine owne self, that I am not at home?</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">A man mocked with

It is a pleasaunt hearing, when one is mocked with the

man, <emph>Egilius</emph> that seemed to be wanton of liuing, and yet was
not so: Ah my sweet darling <emph>Egilia</emph>, when wilt thou come to
my house sweete wench, with thy rocke and thy spindell?
I dare not in good faith (quoth she) my mother hath forbidden

<p>An Eeremite in Italie, professing a meruailous straight life,
and eschewing the Citie dwelt in a Desert, where he made
him self a Caue, wrought by his owne hands with Spade and
Shouell, and couering the same with boughes and earth, lay
there in his Couch or Cabine liuing in contemplation, as one
that vtterly had forsaken the worlde, wherevpon he came in
great credite with the people, and especially with the women
of that Towne, as by Nature women are more apt to beleeue,
and readier giuen to Superstition then men are.  Afterwards
it appeared that this Eremites holinesse was altogether
counterfeite, and he founde a very lewde man.  For it was
knowne and well proued, that he had the companie of diuers
Gentlewomen of that Citie, &amp; therefore being examined
openly, and greeuously rebuked, he confessed that he had the
vse of diuers Ladies there.  Wherevpon a Register that tooke
the note of al their names, being much greeued with his
filthie behauiour, especially because he had vsed so many said
thus.  Ah thou vile man.  Is there any other with whom thou
hast bene acquainted?  Say on beast and shame the Deuill.
The poore Eremite beeing wonderfully rebuked of euery
bodie, and meruailous sorie of such his folies priuely
committed, and openly knowne.  Saied to the Register in
this wise.  Sir, seeing I am charged to say the trueth, and
that the holie mother Church willeth me to leaue nothing
vnrehearsed, that the rather vppon my plaine confession,
I may the sooner haue obsolution: In good faith maister
Register (quoth he) I doe not remember any other sauing
your wife onely, who was the first and the last that euer
I haue touched, since I made my graue, and therefore if it
please you to put her into your booke also, you may boldly
doe it.  For surely she was very louing to me.  With that
the Register in a great heate stoode vp, and casting his pen
out of his hand, would haue bene at the Eremite rather then
his life.  The people laughed hartely, to see the Register that
was so hastie before, to charge the simple Eremite with his
wanton follies, to bee in such sort touched with his wiues
default.  And many then there (as young men bee in such
cases forward) would in any wise, that the Register should
haue written his wiues name in his owne booke,  <emph>ad &aelig;ternam

<p>Those Iestes are bitter which haue a hid vnderstanding in
them, wherof also a man may gather much more then is
spoken.  A homely fellowe made his wofull lamentation to
<emph>Diogenes</emph> in most pitifull sort, because his wife had hanged
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Diogenes doggish aunswere
in despite of women.</note>
her selfe vppon a Figtree, hoping to finde some comfort at
his hande.  But <emph>Diogenes</emph> hearing this straunge deede: for the
loue of God (quoth he) giue me some slippes of that tree, that
I might set them in some Orchard.  The fruite liked him
wel, and belike he thought that such slippes, would haue bene
as good to dispatch noughtie women, as Lime twigges are
thought meete to catch wild birds withal.</p>

<p>An Archdeacon beeing nothing so wise as he was wealthie,
nor yet so learned as he was worshipfull, asked a yong man
once whether he had a good witte or no.  Yea Marie sir
(quoth he) your witte is good enough, if you keepe it still and
vse it not, for euery thing as you knowe, is the worse for the
wearing.  Thou saiest euen troth (quoth he) for that is the
matter that I neuer vsed preaching: for it is nothing but
a wasting of witte, and a spending of winde.  And yet if
I would preach, I thinke I could doe as well as the best of
them.  Yea sir (quoth he) but yet I would ye should not
proue it, for feare a strayning your self too much: why?
Doest thou feare that (quoth he) nay thou maiest be assured,
I will neuer preach so long as I liue, God being my good
Lord.  There are ouer many Heretiques, for good meaning
men to speake any thing now adaies.  You say euen troth
(quoth the yong man) and so went forth: but to tell all, I had
neede to haue time of an other world, or at the least to haue
breath of an other bodie.</p>

<p>An vnlearned Oratour made an Oration on a time,
thinking that he had with his well doing delited much al
men, and moued them to mercie and pittie, and therefore
sitting downe, he asked one <emph>Catulus</emph> if he had not moued the
hearers to mercie.  Yes Marie, quoth he, and that too great
mercie and pitie both, for I think there is none here so hard
harted, but thought your Oration very miserable, and<reg orig="there-fore">therefore</reg>
needfull to be greatly pitied.</p>

<p>Churlish aunsweres like the hearers sometimes very well.
When the father was cast in iudgement, the Sonne seeing
him weepe: why weepe you Father? (quoth he)  To whom

<pb n="152"/>

his father aunswered.  What?  Shall I sing I pray thee,
seeing by Lawe I am condemned to dye.  <emph>Socrates</emph> likewise
beeing mooued of his wife, because he should dye an innocent
and guiltlesse in the law: Why for shame woman (quoth he)
wilt thou haue me to dye giltie &amp; deseruing.  When one
had falne into a ditch, an other pitying his fall, asked him
and saied: Alas how got you into that pit?  Why Gods
mother, quoth the other, doest thou aske me how I got in,
nay tell me rather in the mischiefe, how I shall get out.</p>

<p>There is an other contrarie vnto this kinde, when a man
suffereth wrong, and giueth no sharpe answere at all.  As
when <emph>Cato</emph> was stroken of one that caried a Chest: some say
a long poule: when the other saied after he had hit him.
Take heede sir I pray you: why (quoth <emph>Cato</emph>) doest thou carie
any thing els.</p>

<p>Follie and lacke of naturall wit, or els want of honestie,
giue good matter of mirth oftentimes.  When <emph>Scipio</emph> beeing
<emph>Pretor</emph> had appointed vnto a certaine <emph>Sicilian</emph>, one to be his
Lawier that was of a good house, and had an euill wit, little
better than half a foole: I pray you (quoth the <emph>Sicilian</emph> to
<emph>Scipio</emph>) appoint this Lawyer for mine aduersarie, and let me
haue none at all hardly.</p>

<p>In speaking against an euil man, and wishing somewhat
therupon, a iest may seeme delitefull.  When an euill man
had accused many persons, and none tooke any harme by him,
but rather were acquited from time to time, and taken the
sooner for honest men.  Now would to Christes passion,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Wishing.</note>
quoth a naughtie fellowe, that he were mine accuser, for then
should I bee taken for an honest man also through his
accusation.  <emph>Demonedes</emph> hauing crooked feete, lost on a time
both his shooes, wherevpon he made his prayer to GOD, that
his shooes might serue his feete, that had stolne them away.
A shrewde wish for him that had the shooes, and better neuer
weare shooes, then steale them so dearly.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Coniectures.</note>
Things gathered by coniecture, to seeme otherwise then
they are, delite much the eares being wel applied together.
One was charged for robbing a Church, and almost euidently
proued to be an offender in that behalf, the said man to saue
himself harmelesse, reasoned thus: Why, quoth he, how
should this be, I neuer robbed house, nor yet was euer faultie

<pb n="153"/>

<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">153</fw>

in any offence besides, how then should I presume to rob
a Church?  I haue loued the Church more then any other,
and will louers of the Church robbe the Church?  I haue
giuen to the Church, how happeneth that I am charged to
take from the Church, hauing euer so good minde to Church
dignitie?  Assure your selues they passe litle of the Church
that would aduenture to rob the Church.  They are no
Churchmen, they are maisterlesse men, or rather S. Nicolas
Clarkes that lacke liuing, and going in Procession takes the
Church to bee an Hospitall for way fairers, or a pray for

Thinges wanting, make good pastime beeing aptly vsed.
Alacke, alacke, if such a one had somewhat to take to, and
were not past grace: he would doe well enough without
all doubt: I warrant him: He wants nothing saieth an other
of a couetous man, but one thing, he hath neuer enough.</p>

<p>Such a man hath no fault but one, and if that were amended,
all were well: what is that? (quoth an other) In good faith
he is naught.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Familiar aduise

To giue a familiare aduise in the way of pastime, deliteth
much the hearers.  When an vnlearned Lawyer had been

<emph>Granius</emph> gaue him counsell to drinke sweet wine colde, so sone
as he came home.  Why, quoth he, I shall lose my voce if
I do so.  Marie, quoth he, better do so then vndo thy client,
and lose his matter altogether.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Things spoken

But among all other kindes of delite, there is none that so

contrary to the expectation of other.  <emph>Augustus</emph> Emperour of

<p>When an vnlearned Phisition (as England lacketh none

I had once tried thee, I should neuer haue accused thee, for
then had I beene dead, and in my graue many daies agone.</p>

<p>An English Phisition ryding by the way: and seeing a
great companie of men gathered together, sent his man to
know what the matter was, whervpon his man vnderstanding
that one there was appointed to suffer for killing a man:
came riding backe in al post haste, and cried to his maister,
long before he came at him: get you hence sir, get you hence
for Gods loue.  What meanest thou (quoth his maister.)
Mary (quoth the seruaunt) yonder man shall dye for killing of
one man, and you I dare saie, haue killed a hundred men
in your daies: get you hence therefore for Gods loue if you
loue your self.</p>

<p>An Italian hauing a sute here in England, to the Archbishop
of Yorke that then was, and comming to Yorke Towne at
that time, when one of the Prebendaries there brake his
bread, as they terme it, and therevpon made a solemne long
dinner, the which perhaps began at aleuen, and continued wel
nye fower in the afternoone, at the which dinner this Bishop
was: It so fortuned that as they were set, the Italian knockt
at the gate vnto whom the Porter perceiuing his errand,
aunswered, that my Lord Bishop was at dinner.  The Italian
departed, and returned betwixt xii. and one, the Porter
answered they were yet at diner, he came againe at two of
the clocke, the Porter told him they had not half dined: he
came at three a clock, vnto whom the Porter in a heate
answered neuer a worde, but churlishly did shut the gates
vpon him.  Whereupon others told the Italian, that there was
no speaking with my Lord, almost al that day, for the solemne
dinner sake.  The Italian Gentleman, wondering much at
such long sitting, and greatly greeued, because hee could not
then speake with the Bishops grace, departed straight towards
London, and leauing the dispatch of his matters with a deare
freend of his, tooke his iourney towards Italie.  Three yeares
after it happened that an English man came to <emph>Rome</emph>, with
whom the Italian by chaunce falling acquainted, asked him if
he knewe the Bishop of Yorke.  The Englishman saied, he
knew him right well.  I pray you tell me (quoth the Italian)
hath the Bishop yet dined?  The English man much<reg orig="meruail-ing">meruailing</reg>

A man may by hearing a loude lye, pretelie mocke the lye

and halfe a score tunne of wine dranke in a yere, an other
good fellowe hearing him lye so shamefully: in deede (quoth

an Oxe in one day is nothing, and as for Wine, Beggers that

<p><emph>Salust</emph> being a Gentleman borne, and a man of much wealth,

an Oration in order, that the matter beeing aptly setled and
couched together: might better please the hearers, &amp; with
more ease be learned of al men.  And the rather I am earnest
in this behalf, because I knowe that al things stande by order,
and without order nothing can be.  For by an order we
are borne, by an order we liue, and by an order we make our

ende.  By an order and rule as head, and other obey as
members. By an order Realmes stande, and Lawes take
force.  Yea, by an order the whole worke of Nature, and the
perfite state of all the Elements haue their appointed course.
By an order wee deuise, wee learne and frame our doings to
good purpose.  By an order the Carpenter hath his squire,
his Rule, and his Plomet.  The Taylour his Metyard and his
Measure: The Mason his Former, and his Plaine, and euery
one according to his calling, frameth things thereafter.  For
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Order of what
sort it is.</note>
though matter be had, and that in great plentie: yet all is to
no purpose, if an order be not vsed.  As for example.  What
auaileth Stone, if Masons doe not worke it?  What good
doth cloath, if Taylours take no measure, or doe not cut it
out?  Though Timber bee had for making a Ship, and all
other things necessarie, yet the Ship shal neuer be perfite, till
workmen beginne to set to their hands, and ioyne it together.
In what a comely order hath God made man, whose shape is
not thought perfite, if any part be altered?  Yea, all folke
would take him for a Monster, whose feete should occupie the
place of his handes.  An armie neuer getteth victorie that is
not in araie, and set in good order of battaile.  So an
Oration hath little force with it, and doth smally profite,
which is vtterd without all order.  And needes must he
wander, that knowes not howe to goe, neither can hee otherwise
chuse but stumble: that groping in the darke, cannot tell
where he is: yea, he must needes both leaue much vnspoken,
repeate often thinges spoken before not knowing what, nor
where to speake best: that giues himselfe rather to take the
chaunce of fortune, then to follow the right waie of aduised
counsaile.  What should a man doe with a weapon, that
knoweth not how to vse it?  What though one haue mountaines
of golde, what auaileth him to haue such heapes, if he cannot
tell how to bestowe them?  It is not enough to haue learning,
but it is all to vse learning.  Therefore, because this part of
bestowing matter, and placing it in good order is so necessarie.
I wil shewe what the learned haue saied in this behalfe, so

Diuding of disposition.</head>

<p>THere are two kindes of disposing, and placing of matter.
The one is, when we followe the appointed rule of
<emph>Rhetorique</emph>, the which Nature doth almost teach vs: The other
is wholie fashioned by the discretion of him that makes the
Oration.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Rhetorique, what it
teacheth for ordering
of things.</note>
<emph>Rhetorique</emph> doth teach vs, and Nature also leadeth vs<reg orig="there-unto">thereunto</reg>,
first to speake somewhat before we open our matter,
after that to tell the cause of our entent, setting forth the
matter plainly that all may vnderstande it, then to proue our
owne cause by good reason, and to confute all such thinges,
as are contrarie to our purpose: last of all, to gather the
whole in a somme, concluding the matter briefly, and so to
make an ende.  Now to place those reasons, which should
both serue to confirme, and to confute, and to tell in what
part of the Oration, it were best to vse this reason and that
reason, that the rather we might proue, teach and perswade:
a right wiseman had neede to take this matter in hande.
For euen as the time, the place, the iudge, and the matter it
self shall giue cause: so must a wise bodie take his aduauntage.
Sometimes it shall bee expedient to vse no preface at all, or
els when the matter is well knowne, it will bee good to leaue
the matter vntold, and straight to seeke the confirmation,
vsing some strong reason for the same purpose.  Yea,<reg orig="some-times">sometimes</reg>
it may doe good, to neglect the naturall order, and
beginne first to proue the cause, and afterward to tell it better
then it was tolde before.</p>

<p>If the Iudge or the hearers, shalbe wearied with other
reportes before, it is best to go to the matter, and proue it
out of hande, with as briefe reasons and as strong as can
be gathered possible.  And in prouing of our matters we
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Arguments how they
should be digested.</note>
had neede euermore, rather to weye our reasons, then to
number them, and thinke not that then we shall doe beste
when we haue the strongest.  And first of all the strongest
should be vsed, and the other placed in the middest of
the oration, the which being heaped together will make
a good mustar.  And yet this also would be learned,
whereas we vsed the best reasons at the first, wee should also
reserue some that were like good for the latter end: that the
hearers might haue them fresh in their remembrance, when

<pb n="159"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">159</fw>

they should giue iudgement. The slender reasons that can do
lesse good, and yet not at al (for some may better be omitted)
would be placed in the middest (as I said) that both they
might be lesse marked, or being heaped there together they
might doe more good, especially when both weightie reasons
went before, and weightie reasons also folowed after.  Now
a wiseman that hath good experience in these affaires, and is
able to make himself a <emph>Rhetorique</emph> for euery matter, will not be
bound to any precise rules, nor keepe any one order, but
such onely as by reason he shall thinke best to vse, being
master ouer arte, rather then arte should be maister ouer him,
rather making arte by wit, then confounding wit by arte.
And vndoubtedly euen in so dooing he shall doe right well,
and content the hearers accordingly.  For what mattereth
whether we followe our booke or no, if wee followe wit and
appoint our selfe an order, such as may declare the trueth
more plainly?  Yea, some that bee vnlearned, and yet haue
right good wittes: will deuise with themselues without any
booke learning, that they will say, and how much they will
saie, appointing their order, and parting it into three or
fower partes or more if neede be, such as they shall thinke
especiall points, and most meete to bee touched.  Whose
doings as I can well like, and much commend them for the
same: so I would thinke them much more able to doe much
better: If they either by learning followed a paterne, or els
knewe the precepts which lead vs to right order.  Rules were
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">The vse of
Arte.</note>
therefore giuen, and by much obseruation gathered together,
that those which could not see Arte hid in an other mans
doings, should yet see the rules open, all in an order set
together: and thereby iudge the rather of their doings, and
by earnest imitation, seeke to resemble such their inuention.
I can not denie, but that a right wise man vnlearned, shall
doe more good by his Naturall witte, then twentie of these
common wittes that want Nature to helpe Arte.  And I
knowe that rules were made first by wisemen, and not wisemen
made by rules.  For these precepts serue onely to helpe our
neede, such as by Nature haue not such plentifull giftes.
And as for other vnto whom Nature is more fauourable, they
are rather put the sooner in remembrance, that such lessons
are then so taught as though they neuer knewe them, or els

<pb n="160"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">160</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

neuer would vse them.  And therefore a certain learned man
and of much excellencie, being asked what was such a figure,
and such a trope in <emph>Rhetorique</emph>: I can not tell (quoth he) but
I am assured, if you looke in the booke of mine Orations, you
shal not faile but find them.  So that though he knewe not
the name of such, and such figures, yet the Nature of them
was so familiare to his knowledge, that he had the vse of
them when soeuer he had neede.  Now though this man
could well thus doe, being of such notable vnderstanding, yet
it were foly that I should followe his waie, which want so good
a wit.  And I thinke euen he him selfe should not haue lost
by it neither, if he had seen that in a glasse, which he often
vsed to doe without knowledge.  Man is forgetfull, and there
is none so wise but counsaill may doe him good.  Yea, he
shall doe much better that knoweth what arte other men haue
vsed, what inuention they haue followed, what order they
haue kept, and how they haue beste doen in euery parte.  If he

<hi rend="center">like not theirs, he may vse his owne, and yet none doth so<lb/>
euill (I thinke) but some good may be got by him.<lb/>
The wise therefore will not refuse to heare:<lb/>
and the ignoraunt for want had<lb/>
neede to seeke a will.</hi>

<p>AND now we are
come to that part of <emph>Rhetorique</emph>, the
which aboue all other is most beautifull, wherby not
onely words are aptly vsed, but also sentences are in right
order framed.  For whereas Inuention helpeth to finde
matter, and Disposition serueth to place arguments: <reg orig="Elocu-tion">Elocution</reg>
getteth words to set forth inuention, and with such
beautie commendeth the matter, that reason semeth to be

<emph>Tullie</emph> saieth well, to finde out reason and aptly to frame
it, is the part of a wiseman, but to commende it by wordes and
with gorgious talke to tell our conceipt, that is onely proper
to an Oratour.  Many are wise, but fewe haue the gift to set

<pb n="161"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">161</fw>

forth their wisedome.  Many can tel their mind in English, but
fewe can vse meete termes and apt order: such as all men
should haue, and wisemen will vse: such as needes must bee
had when matters should be vtterd.  Now then what is he at
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Eloquent men
most esteemed.</note>
whom al men wonder, and stand in a mase at the vewe of
his wit: whose doings are best esteemed?  Whom we doe
most reuerence, and compt half a God among men?  Euen
such a one assuredly that can plainly, distinctly, plentifully
and aptly, vtter both words and matter, and his talke can vse
such composition, that he may appere to keepe an vniformitie,
and (as I might saie) a nomber in the vttering of his sentence.
Now an eloquent man being smally learned can much more
good in perswading by shift of wordes, and meete placing of
matter: then a great learned clarke shalbe able with great
store of learning, wanting words to set forth his meaning.
Wherefore I much meruaile that so many seke the onely
knowledge of things, without any mind to commend or set
forth their intendement: seing none can knowe either what
thei are, or what they haue without the gift of vtterance.
Yea bring them to speak their minde, and enter in talke with
such as are said to be learned, and you shal finde in them
such lacke of vttrance, that if you iudge them by their tongue,
and expressing of their minde: you must needes say they haue
no learning.  Wherin me thinkes they do like some rich
snudges hauing great wealth, goe with their hose out at
heeles, their shoes out at toes, and their coates out at both

elbowes.  For who can tell if such men are woorth a groate,
when their apparell is so homely, and all their behauiour so
base?  I can call them by none other name but slouens, that
may haue good geare, and neither can nor yet wil once weare
it clenly.  What is a good thing to a man, if he neither
know the vse of it, nor yet (though he knowe it) is able at
all to vse it?  If we think it comelinesse and honestie to set
forth the bodie with handsome apparel, and thinke them
worthy to haue money, that both can and will vse it <reg orig="accord-ingly">accordingly</reg>:
I can not otherwise see but that this part deserueth
praise, which standeth wholy in setting foorth matter, by apt
wordes and sentences together, and beautifeth the tongue
with great chaunge of colours, and varietie of figures.</p>

AMong all other lessons this should first be learned, that
wee neuer affect any straunge ynkehorne termes, but to
speake as is commonly receiued: neither seeking to be ouer
fine, nor yet liuing ouer-carelesse vsing our speeche as most
men doe, and ordering our wittes as the fewest haue done.
Some seeke so far for outlandish English, that they forget
altogether their mothers language.  And I dare sweare this,
if some of their mothers were aliue, thei were not able to
tell what they say: and yet these fine English clerkes will say,
they speake in their mother tongue, if a man should charge
them for counterfeiting the Kings English.  Some farre
iourneyed gentlem[e]n at their returne home, like as they loue
to goe in forraine apparell, so thei wil pouder their talke with
ouersea language.  He that commeth lately out of Fraunce,
will talke French English and neuer blush at the matter.
An other chops in with English Italienated, and applieth
the Italian phrase to our English speaking, the which is, as if
an Oratour that professeth to vtter his mind in plaine Latine,
would needes speake Poetrie, and farre fetched colours of
straunge antiquitie.  The Lawyer will store his stomacke
with the prating of Pedlers.  The Auditor in making his
accompt and reckening, cometh in with <emph>sise sould</emph>, and <emph>cater

will speake nothing but quaint Prouerbes, and blinde <reg orig="Alle-gories">Allegories</reg>,
delighting much in their owne darkenesse, especially,
when none can tell what they doe say.  The vnlearned or
foolish phantasticall, that smelles but of learning (such fellowes
as haue seen learned men in their daies) wil so Latin their
tongues, that the simple can not but wonder at their talke,
and thinke surely they speake by some reuelation.  I know
them that thinke <emph>Rhetorique</emph> to stande wholie vpon darke

some is rude English, or the one is court talke, the other is

<emph>Rhetorique</emph>, and vse altogether one maner of language.  When
I was in Cambridge, and student in the kings College, there
came a man out of the toune with a pint of wine in a pottle
pot, to welcome the prouost of that house, that lately came
from the court.  And because he would bestow his present
like a clarke, dwelling among the scholers: he made humblie
his three curtesies and sayd in this maner.  Cha good euen

An other good fellowe of the countrey, being an Officer

that all other vacation knaues shall take ilsample by thee.</p>

<p>An other standing in much neede of money, and desirous
to haue some helpe, at a gentlemans hande, made his <reg orig="com-plainte">complainte</reg>
in this wise.  I pray you sir be so good vnto me, as
forbeare this halfe yeres rent.  For so help me God and
halidome, we are so taken on with contrary Bishops, with
reuiues, and with Southsides to the King, that all our money
is cleane gone.  These words he spake for Contribution,
Releef, and Subsidie.  And thus we see that poore simple men
are much troubled, and talke oftentimes they knowe not

<pb n="165"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">165</fw>

what for lacke of wit, and want of Latine and French,
whereof many of our strange wordes full often are deriued.
Those therefore that will eschue this folly, and acquaint
themselues with the best kind of speech, must seeke from
time to time such wordes as are commonly receiued, and
such as properly may expresse in plaine maner, the whole
conceipt of their minde.  And looke what wordes we best
vnderstande, and knowe what they meane: the same should
soonest be spoken, and first applied to the vtterance of our
purpose.</p>

<p>Now whereas wordes be receiued, aswell Greeke as
Latine, to set forth our meaning in the English tongue,
either for lacke of store, or els because we would enrich the
language: it is well doen to vse them, and no man therein
can be charged for any affectation, when all other are agreed
to followe the same waie.  There is no man agreeued when
he heareth (Letters Patents) and yet Patentes is Latine, and
signifieth open to all men.  The Communion is a fellowship,
or a comming together, rather Latin then English: the
kings prerogatiue declareth his power roiall aboue al other, and
yet I know no man greeued for these termes, being vsed in
their place, nor yet any one suspected for affectation, when
such generall wordes are spoken.  The folie is espied, when
either we will vse such wordes as fewe men doe vse, or vse
them out of place, when an other might serue much better.
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Fower things <reg orig="ob-serued">obserued</reg>

Therefore to auoide such folly, we may learne of that most
excellent Oratour <emph>Tullie</emph>, who in his third booke, where he
speaketh of a perfect Oratour, declareth vnder the name of
<emph>Crassus</emph>, that for the choise of words fower things should
chefly be obserued.  First that such words as we vse, should
be proper vnto the tongue wherein wee speake, againe, that
they bee plaine for all men to perceiue: thirdly, that they be
apt and meete, most properly to sette out the matter.
Fourthly, that words translated from one signification to an
other (called of the Grecians <emph>Tropes</emph>) be vsed to beautifie the
sentence, as precious stones are set in a ring to commende
the gold.</p>

nature of the same.  Therefore they that haue regard of their
estimation do warely speake, and with choise vtter woordes
most apt for their purpose.  In waightie causes graue wordes
are thought most needful, that the greatnesse of the matter
may the rather appere in the vehemencie of their talke.  So
likewise of other like order must be taken.  Albeit some not

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Vnapt vsing

into much fondnes, by vsing words out of place, and
applying them to diuers matters without all discretion.  As
thus.  An ignorant fellowe comming to a gentlemans place,
and seeing a great flocke of shepe in his pasture, said to the
owner of them, nowe by my trueth sir, here is as goodly an
audience of sheepe as euer I saw in my life.  Who will not
take this fellowe meeter to talke with sheepe, then speake

<p>An other likewise seeing an house faire builded, said to his
fellow thus: good lord what a handsome phrase of building is
this?  Thus are good words euill vsed, when they are not
wel applied and spoken to good purpose.  Therefore I wish that
such vntowarde speaking, may giue vs a good lesson to vse our

ioyning together of wordes in such order, that neither the eare
shall espie any ierre, nor yet any man shalbe dulled with
ouerlong drawing out of a sentence, nor yet much confounded
with mingling of causes such as are needelesse, being heaped
together without reason, and vsed without number.  For by
such meanes the hearers will be forced to forget full ofte,
what was sayd first, before the sentence bee halfe ended: or
els be blinded with confounding of many things together.

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Faultes in composition.</note>
Some againe will be so short, and in such wise curtall their
sentences, that they had neede to make a commentary
immediatly of their meaning, or els the most that heare them
shalbe forced to keepe counsaill.</p>

<p>Some will speake Oracles, that a man can not tell which
way to take them, some will bee so fine and so poeticall <reg orig="with-all">withall</reg>,
that to their seeming there shall not stande one haire
a misse, and yet euery body els shall thinke them meeter for
a Ladies chamber, then for an earnest matter in any open
assemblie.</p>

<p>Some will roue so much and bable so farre without order,
that a man would thinke they had a greate loue to heare them
selues speake.</p>

<p>Some repeate one worde so often, that if such wordes could
be eaten, and chopt in so oft as they are vttered out, they
would choke the widest throte in al England.  As thus.  If
a man knew what a mans life were, no man for any mans sake
woulde kill any man, but one man would rather helpe an other
man, considering man is borne for man to helpe man, and not
to hate man.  What man would not be choked, if he chopt al
these men at once into his mouth, and neuer dronke after it?
Some vse ouermuch repetition of some one letter, as pitifull
pouertie praieth for a penie, but puffed presumption passeth not
a point, pampering his panch with pestilent pleasure, procuring
his passeport to poste it to hell pit, there to be punished with
paines perpetuall.  Some will so set their words, that they
must be faine to gape after euery word spoken, ending one
word with a vowell, and beginning the next with an other,
which vndoubtedly maketh the talke to seeme most vnpleasaunt.
As thus.  Equitie assuredly euery iniurie auoideth.  Some will
set the Cart before the horse, as thus.  My mother and my
father are both at home, as though the good man of the house
did weare no breches, or that the graie Mare were the better
Horse.  And what though it often so happeneth (God wot the
more pitty) yet in speaking at the least, let vs keepe a naturall
order, and set the man before the woman for maners sake.</p>

<p>An other comming home in haste, after a long iourney,
saieth to his man: Come hether sir knaue, helpe me of with
my bootes and my spurres.  I praie you sir, giue him leaue
first to plucke of your spurres, ere he meddle with your bootes,

<pb n="168"/>

or els your man is like to haue a madde plucking.  Who is so
foolish as to say, the Counsaile and the King, but rather the
King and his Counsaile, the Father and the Sonne, and not
contrary.  And so likewise in all other, as they are in degree
first euermore to set them formost.</p>

<p>The wise therefore talking of diuers worthie men together,
will first name the worthiest, and keepe a decent order in
reporting of their tale.  Some end their sentences all alike,
making their talke rather to appeare rimed Meeter, then
to seeme plaine speeche, the which as it much deliteth being
measurably vsed, so it much offendeth when no meane is
regarded.  I heard a preacher deliting much in this kind of
composition, who vsed so often to ende his sentences with
wordes like vnto that which went before, that in my <reg orig="iudge-ment">iudgement</reg>
there was not a dosen sentences in his whole sermon,
but they ended all in Rime for the most parte.  Some not
best disposed, wished the Preacher a Lute, that with his rimed
sermon he might vse some pleasant melody, and so the people
might take pleasure diuers waies, and dance if they list.  Certes
there is a meane, and no reason to vse any one thing at al
time, seing nothing deliteth (be it neuer so good) that is
alwaies vsed.</p>

<p><emph>Quintilian</emph> likeneth the colours of <emph>Rhetorique</emph> to a mans eye
sight.  And now (quoth he) I would not haue all the bodie to be
full of eyes, or nothing but eyes: for then the other partes
should wante their due place and proportion.  Some <reg orig="ouer-thwartly">ouerthwartly</reg>
sette their wordes, placing some one a mile from his
fellowes, not contented with a plaine and easie composition,
but seeke to set wordes they can not tell how, and therefore
one not liking to bee called, and by print published Doctour
of Phisicke, would needes bee named a Phisicke Doctour,
wherein appeared a wonderful composition (as he thought)
strange vndoubtedly, but whether wise or no, let the learned
sit in iudgement vpon that matter.</p>

<p>An other.  As I rose in a Morning (quoth one) I met
a Carte full of stones emptie.  Belike the man was fasting,
when the Cart was full, and yet wee see that through straunge
composition, his sentence appeareth darke.</p>

<p>Some will tell one thing twentie times, nowe in, nowe out,
and when a man would thinke they had almost ended, they

<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">169</fw>

are ready to beginne againe as fresh as euer they were.  Such
vaine repetitions declare both want of witte, and lacke of
learning.  Some are so homely in all their doings, and so
grosse for their inuention, that they vse altogether one maner
of trade, and seeke no varietie to eschue tediousnesse.</p>

<p>Some burden their talke with needlesse copie, and will
seeme plentifull when they should be short.  An other is so
curious and so fine of his tongue, that he can not tell in all
the world what to speake.  Euery sentence seemeth common,
and euery worde generally vsed, is thought to be foolish in
his wise iudgement.  Some vse so many interpositions, both
in their talke and in their writing, that they make their
sayings as darke as hell.  Thus when faltes be knowne they
may bee auoyded: and vertue the sooner may take place,
when vice is foreseen and eschued as euill.</p>

translations, that our speech may seeme as bright and precious,
as a rich stone is faire and orient.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes"><reg orig="Exorna-tion">Exornation</reg>.
Three maner of stiles
or enditings.</note>
Exornation, is a gorgious beautifying of the tongue with
borowed wordes, and change of sentence or speech with much
varietie.  First therefore (as <emph>Tullie</emph> saith) an oration is made
to seme right excellent by the kind selfe, by the colour and
iuice of speech.  There are three maner of stiles or inditings,
the great or mightie kinde, when we vse great wordes, or
vehement figures.</p>

<p>The small kinde, when wee moderate our heate by meaner
wordes, and vse not the most stirring sentences.</p>

<p>The lawe kinde, when we vse no <emph>Metaphores</emph> nor translated
words, nor yet vse any amplifications, but goe plainly to
worke, and speake altogether in common wordes.  Now in al
these three kindes, the Oration is much commended, and
appereth notable when wee keepe vs still to that stile which
we first professed, and vse such wordes as seeme for that kinde
of writing most conuenient.  Yea, if we minde to encrease
or diminish: to be in a heate, or to vse moderation.  To
speake pleasauntly or grauely: To be sharpe or soft: to talke

<pb n="170"/>

lordly, or to speake finely: to waxe auncient or familiare
(which are all comprehended vnder one of the other three:
we must euer make our wordes apt and agreeable to that
kinde of stile which we first began to vse.  For as Frenche
hoodes doe not become Lords: so Parliament robes are
vnfitting for Ladies.  Comelinesse therefore must euer be vsed,
and all things obserued, that are most meete for euery cause,
if we looke by attemptes to haue our desire.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Exornation by colours

There is an other kind of Exornation, that is not egally
sparpled throughout the whole Oration, but is so disseuered
and parted as starres stande in the Firmament, or flowers in
a garden, or pretie deuised antiques in a cloth of Arras.</p>

</div2>
<div2 type="subsection" n="What a figure is."><head>What a figure is.</head>
<p>A Figure is a certaine kinde, either of sentence, Oration,

vnlike to that which men commonly vse to speake.</p>

</div2>
<div2 type="subsection" n="The deuision of figures."><head>The deuision of figures.</head>
<p>THere are three kindes of figures, the one is, when the
nature of wordes is chaunged from one signification to
an other, called a <emph>Trope</emph>, of the Grecians: The other serueth
for words when they are not chaunged by nature, but only
altered by speaking, called of the Grecians <emph>Scheme</emph>.  The third
is, when by diuersitie of inuention, a sentence is many wayes
spoken, and also matters are amplified by heaping examples,
by dilating arguments, by comparing of things together, by
similitudes, by contraries, and by diuers other like, called
by <emph>Tullie</emph> Exornation of sentences, or colours of <emph>Rhetorike</emph>.</p>

<p>By all which figures euery Oration may be much beautified,
and without the same, not one can attaine to be coumpted an
Oratour, though his learning otherwise be neuer so great.</p>

<div3 type="para"><head>Of the first vse of Tropes.</head>
<p>WHen learned and wisemen gan first to inlarge their
tongue, and sought with great vtterance of speech to
commende causes: They founde full oft much want of words
to set out their meaning.  And therfore remembring thinges
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Tropes how they were
first founded.</note>
of like nature vnto those whereof they speake: they vsed
such wordes to expresse their mynde, as were most like vnto
other.  As for example.  If I should speake against some notable
Pharisey.  I might vse translation of wordes in this wise:
Yonder man is of a crooked iudgement, his wittes are cloudie,

<pb n="171"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">171</fw>

he liueth in deepe darknesse dusked altogether with blinde
ignorance, and drowned in the raging sea of bottomlesse
Superstition.  Thus is the ignorant set out by calling him
crooked, cloudie, darke, blinde, and drounde in Superstition.
All which wordes are not proper vnto ignorance, but borowed
of other things that are of like nature vnto ignorance.  For
the vnskilfull man hath his witte set out of order, as a mans
bodie is set out of ioynt, and thereupon it may be sayd to be
crooked.  Likewise hee may bee called Cloudie, for as the Cloudes
keepe the Sonne shining from vs, so doth his ignoraunce
keepe him blindfolde from the true understanding of thinges.
And as when the eyes are out, no man can see any thing:
So when parfite iudgement is wanting, the troth can not be
knowne.  And so likewise of all other.  Thus as necessitie
hath forced vs to borowe wordes translated: So hath time and
practize made them to seeme most pleasaunt, and therefore
they are much the rather vsed.  Yea when a thing full ofte
can not bee exprest by an apt and meete worde, wee doe <reg orig="per-ceiue">perceiue</reg>
(when it is spoken by a worde translated) that the <reg orig="like-nesse">likenesse</reg>
of that thing, which appeareth in an other word much
lighteneth that, which we would most gladly haue perceiued.</p>

<p>And not onely doe men vse translation of words (called
<emph>Tropes</emph>) for neede sake, when they can not finde other: but
also when they may haue most apt words at hand, yet will they
of a purpose vse translated wordes.  And the reason is this.
Men coumpt it a point of witte, to passe ouer such words as
are at hand, and to vse such as are farre fetcht and translated:
or els it is because the hearer is ledde by cogitation vppon
rehearsall of a Metaphore, and thinketh more by <reg orig="remem-braunce">remembraunce</reg>
of a worde translated, then is there expressely spoken:
or els because the whole matter seemeth by a similitude to be
opened: or laste of all, because euery translation is commonly,
and for the most part referred to the senses of the bodie, and
especially to the sense of seeing, which is the sharpest and
quickest aboue all other.  For when I shall say that an angrie
man fometh at the mouth, I am brought in remembrance by
this translation to remember a Bore, that in fighting vseth
much foming, the which is a foule and lothly sight.  And I cause
other to thinke that he brake pacience wonderfully, when
I set out his rage comparable to a bores foming.</p>

two in their tyme were notable fooles.  Or when one is lustie,
to say Taratauntara, declaring thereby that he is as lustie, as
a Trumpette is delitefull and stirring: or when one would
seme galant, to crie hoigh, whereby also is declared courage.
Boyes being greeued will say some one to another: sir, I will
cap you, if you vse mee thus, and withhold that from me
which is mine owne: meaning that he will take his cap from
him.  Again, when we see one gaie and gallaunt, we vse to say,
he courtes it.  Quoth one that reasoneth in Diuinitie with his
fellowe, I like well to reason, but I cannot chappe these textes
in Scripture, if I should dye for it: meaning that he could not
tell in what Chapter thinges were conteined, although he

<note place="marg" anchored="yes"><reg orig="Intellec-tion">Intellection</reg>.</note>
INtellection, called of the Grecians, <emph>Synedoche</emph>, is a Trope,
when we gather or iudge the whole by the part, or part by
the whole.  As thus: The King is come to London, meaning
therby that other also be come with him.  The French man
is good to keepe a Fort, or to skirmish on Horsbacke, <reg orig="where-by">whereby</reg>

England is not glad but the most part.</p>

<p>The like phrases are in the Scripture, as when the <emph>Magians</emph>

King of the Jewes.  <emph>Herode</emph> start vp being greatly troubled,
and all the Citie of <emph>Hierusalem</emph> with him, and yet all the Citie
was not troubled, but the most part.  By the signe wee <reg orig="vnder-stand">vnderstand</reg>
the thing signified: as by an Iuie garland, we iudge there
is wine to sel.  By the signe of a Beare, Bull, Lyon, or any
such, we take any house to be an Inne.  By eating bread at
the Communion, we remember Christes death, and by faith
receiue him spiritually.</p></div3>

ABusion, called of the Grecians <emph>Catechresis</emph>, is when for

TRansmutation helpeth much for varietie, the which is,

being referred to an other thing, hath an other meaning: the
Grecians call it <emph>Metonymia</emph>, the which is diuers waies vsed.
When we vse the author of a thing, for the thing self.  As

England, that is to say, all his Superstition and Hipocrisie,
either is or should bee gone to the Deuill, by the Kings
expresse will and commaundement.  Againe, when that which

haue dronke an Hoggeshead this weeke: Heauen may reioyce,

Contrariwise, when the thing conteined, is vsed for the thing

<p>AN Allegorie is none other thing, but a Metaphore, vsed
throughout a whole sentence, or Oration.  As in <reg orig="speak-ing">speaking</reg>
against a wicked offendour, I might say thus.  Oh Lord,
his nature was so euill, and his witte so wickedly bent, that he
meant to bouge the ship, where he himselfe failed: meaning
that he purposed the destruction of his owne Countrey.  It is
euill putting strong Wine into weake vesselles, that is to say, it
is euill trusting some women with weightie matters.  The
English Prouerbes gathered by Iohn Heywood, helpe well in
this behalfe, the which commonly are nothing els but <reg orig="Alle-gories">Allegories</reg>,

and helpeth much to set forth our matter.  For if we stil kepe

though we be driuen through bytalke to goe from it now and

THis figure is called a discription, or an euident <reg orig="declara-tion">declaration</reg>
of a thing, as though we saw it euen now done.  An
example: If our enemies shall inuade, and by treason winne
the victorie, we shal all dye euery mothers sonne of vs, and
our Citie shalbe destroyed sticke and stone.  I see our children
made slaues, our daughters rauished, our wiues caried away,
the father forced to kil his owne sonne, the mother her

daughter, the sonne his father, the sucking child slaine in the
mothers bosome, one standing to the knees in an others bloud,
Churches spoyled, houses pluckt downe, and al set in fire
round about vs, euery one cursing the day of their birth,
children crying, women wayling, and olde men passing for
very thought, and euery one thinking himselfe most happie
that is rid out of this world, such will the crueltie bee of our
enemies, and with such horrible hatred will they seeke to
dispatch vs.  Thus, where I might haue said we shall all be
destroyed, and say no more, I haue by description set the euill
foorth at large.  It much auayleth to vse this figure in diuers
matters, the which whosoeuer can doe, with any excellent gift,
vndoubtedly he shal much delite the hearers.  The <reg orig="circum-staunces">circumstaunces</reg>
well considered in euery cause, giue much matter, for
the plaine opening of the thing.  Also similitudes, examples,
comparisons, from one thing to an other, apt translations, and
heaping of Allegories, and all such figures as serue for <reg orig="ampli-fying">amplifying</reg>,
doe much commend the liuely setting forth of any
matter.  The miseries of the Courtiers life, might well bee
described by this kind of figure.  The commoditie of learning,
the pleasure of Plowmen, and the care that a King hath.
And not onely are matters set out by description, but men

Kingdomes and Realmes are portured, places and times are
described.  The Englishman for feeding and chaunging for

body, and much disdaine: the Italian for great wit and
policie: the Scots for boldnesse, and the Boeme for <reg orig="stub-bornesse">stubbornesse</reg>.</p>

<p>Many people are described by their degree, as a man of
good yeares, is coumpted sober, wise, and circumspect:
a young man wilde and carelesse: a woman babling, <reg orig="incon-staunt">inconstaunt</reg>,
and readie to beleeue all that is tolde her.</p>

<p>By vocation of life, a Souldier is coumpted a great bragger,
and a vaunter of himself: A Scholer simple: A Russet coate,
sad, and sometimes craftie: a Courtier, flattering: a Citizen,
gentle.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Description
of persons.</note>
In describing of persons, there ought alwaies a comelinesse
to bee vsed, so that nothing be spoken, which may bee thought
is not in them.  As if one shall describe Henry the sixth, he
might cal him gentle, milde of Nature, led by perswasion, and
readie to forgiue, carelesse for wealth, suspecting none,
mercifull to all, fearefull in aduersitie, and without forecast
to espie his misfortune.  Againe, for Richard the third, I
might bring him in, cruel of heart, ambicious by nature,
enuious of mind, a deepe dissembler, a close man for weightie
matters, hardie to reuenge, and fearfull to lose his high estate,
trustie to none, liberall for a purpose, casting still the worst,
and hoping euer the best.  By this figure also wee imagine
a talke, for some one to speake, and according to his person,
we frame the Oration.  As if one should bring in noble
Henrie the eight, of most famous memorie to enueigh against
Rebelles, thus he might order his Oration.  What if Henry
the eight were a liue, and sawe such Rebellion in this Realme,
would not he say thus, and thus?  Yea, me thinkes I heare
him speake euen now.  And so set forth such wordes, as we
would haue him to say.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is good to make GOD, the Countrey, or some
one Towne to speake, and looke what we would say in our
owne person, to frame the whole tale to them.  Such varietie
doth much good to auoyde tediousnesse, for he that speaketh

a noble countrey England is, how great commodities it hath,
what traffique here is vsed, and how much more neede other

MOunting aboue the trueth, is when wee doe set foorth

promised to Abraham, that he would make his posteritie equal
with the sandes of the earth.  Now it was not so saied, that
there should be so many in deede, but that the number should
bee infinite.  For whether shall wee vnderstande those to bee
the children of Abraham, that came of his stocke in flesh, or
els take them for the children of Abraham, that haue the faith
of Abraham: we shall neuer proue the number of men to be
equal with the sands of the Sea, though we could recken all

beastes, of mettalles, of stones, and al such as haue any vertue

appeareth a similitude, which being dilated helpeth well for
amplification.  As thus.  You striue against the streame,
better bowe then breake.  It is euill running against a stone
wall.  A man may loue his house well, &amp; yet not ride vpon

and enlarge it at pleasure.  The Prouerbes of Hewood helpe
wonderfull well for this purpose.  In comparing a thing from
the lesse to the greater.  Similitudes help well to set out the
matter.  That if we purpose to dilate our cause hereby with
poses &amp; sentences, wee may with ease talke at large.  This

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Similitude

shall serue for an example.  The more precious a thing is,
the more diligently should it bee kept, and better heede taken
to it.  Therefore time (considering, nothing is more precious)
would warely be vsed, and good care taken, that no time bee
lost, without some profite gotten.  For if they are to bee
punished that spende their money, and waist their Landes,
what follie is it, not to thinke them worthie much more
blame, that spende their time (which is the chiefest treasure
that GOD giueth) either idely, or els vngodly?  For what
other thing doth man lose, when he loseth his time, but his
life?  And what can bee more deare to man then his life?
If wee lose a little money, or a Ring of golde with a stone in
it, we coumpt that great losse.  And I pray you, when wee
lose a whole day, which is a good portion of a mans life,
shall we not compt that a losse, considering though our
money bee gone, wee may recouer the same againe, but time
lost can neuer be called backe againe.  Againe, when we lose
our money, some bodie getteth good by it, but the losse of
time turneth to no mans auaile.  There is no man that loseth
in any other thing, but some bodie gaineth by it, sauing onely
in the losse of time: yea, it hath saued the life of some to
lose al that they had.  For riches bee the occasion sometimes
of much mischiefe in this life, so that it were better sometimes
wastefully to spende, then warely to keepe: by the losse of
time, no man hath profited him selfe any thing at all.  Besides
this, the better and more precious a thing is, the more shame
to spend it fondly.  Though men keepe their goodes neuer
so close, and locke them vp neuer so fast, yet oftentimes,

but the losse of time, seeing it happeneth through our owne

of infamie, when the whole blame shall rest vpon none other
mans necke, but vpon his onely that suffereth all the harme.
With money a man may buy lande, but none can get honestie
of that price: and yet with well vsing of time, a man not
onely might get him much worshippe, but also might purchase
himsefe a name for euer.  Yea, in a small tyme a man might
get great fame, and liue in much estimation.  By losing
of money we lose little els: but losing of time we lose all
the goodnesse and giftes of God, which by labor might be
had.  Thus similitudes might be enlarged by heaping good
sentences, when one thing is compared with an other, and
conclusion made thereupon.  Among the learned men of the
Church, no one vseth this figure more then <emph>Chrisostome</emph>, whose
writings the rather seeme more pleasaunt and sweete.  For
similitudes are not onely vsed to amplifie a matter, but also

the vtter abhorring of all such vnkind dealing.  For
he that is vnthankfull, for hartie loue sheweth cankard

of the law, standeth in the loue which man oweth first to

yea, let him haue neuer so good qualities, or bee he neuer so

Whereupon the Theeues beeing greatly afraied, ranne cleane

away to saue themselues harmelesse.  Thus through the <reg orig="thank-fulnesse">thankfulnesse</reg>
of a Dragon, this mans life was saued.</p>

<p>The Dog of the Romaine <emph>Fuluius</emph> is more wonderfull.  This
<emph>Fuluius</emph> trauailing by the way was slaine with slaues, that laie
in waite for him.  His Dogge seeing his master dead, laie by
him for the space of two daies.  Whereupon when the man
<note place="marg" anchored="yes"><reg orig="Thankful-nesse">Thankfulnesse</reg>
of a Dog.</note>
was missing, and search made for him: They founde him dead
with his Dog lying by him.  Some marueiling to see the Dog
lye there by his dead Master, stroke him and would haue
driuen him from the dead corse, and could not: some seeing
such kindenesse in the dog, and pitying him that he should lye
there without meate two or three daies before: cast him
a peece of flesh: whereupon the Dog straight caried the meate
to his maisters mouth, and would not eate any whit himselfe,
though he had forborne meate so long before.  And last of all
when the dead body should be cast into the Riuer (according to
the maner of the Romaines) the dog lept in after, and <reg orig="hold-ing">holding</reg>
vp his maister so long as he could, did chuse rather to dye
with him, then to liue without him.</p>

<p>The Lion (whereof <emph>Appian</emph> the Grammarian doeth speake)
is also strange for his kindnesse, and almost incredible.  A
seruant that had run awaie from his master, and hid him selfe
for feare in a Caue within a great wood, tooke a thorne out
of a Lions foote, which then came to him for succour as he
laie there.  Now when he had done, the Lion to requite his
<note place="marg" anchored="yes"><reg orig="Thankful-nesse">Thankfulnesse</reg>

good turne, brought such meat to the Caue as he could kill
in the Wood.  The which meate the seruant rosting against
the Sunne (being in the most hot Countrey of all <emph>Affrica</emph>) did
eate from tyme to time.  At length yet being wearie of such
a lothsome life, hee left the caue and came abroad, by meanes
whereof he was taken again, and being a slaue to his maister
(who had power of life and death ouer him) he was condemned
to be cast to wilde beasts at Rome, there to be deuoured of
a Lyon.  The poore caitife stoode pitifully in the sight of
thousands, euer looking when he should be deuoured.  It
happened at the same time when this fellow was thus <reg orig="ad-iudged">adiudged</reg> to die:
that the same Lion was taken, whose foote he
healed in the wood.  When the Lion was put to him, he
came first very terrible towards the fellowe, and immediatly
knowing what he was, stood still, and at length fauned gently

vpon him.  This fellowe at first being amased, began to take
harte vnto him afterwardes, as half knowing him likewise,
and thus they began both to take acquaintance the one of
the other, and plaied together a good space without all
daunger, whereupon the people being amased, much wondered
at the straungenesse of this thing.  And standing thus astonied,
they sent to know of the slaue what this matter should meane.
Unto whom this poore wretch opened the whole thing <reg orig="al-together">altogether</reg>
euen as it happened.  When the people heard this,
they not onely reioyced much at the sight thereof, but also
they made earnest request to his maister for his life.  His
maister marueiling asmuch as any of them at such an vnwonted
kindnesse: gaue him not onely his life, but also his freedome.
And now to the ende he might haue somewhat whereupon to
liue, the people gaue him a fee for terme of his life.  The
felowe by and by gat him a line and a coler, and caried the
Lion vp and doune the Citie in such sort, as Huntesmen
cary a Greihound or a Spanell, the people still wondering
and saying euer as he came by: beholde a man that hath
cured a Lion: beholde a Lion that hath saued a man.  The
which example the more straunge it is, the more ashamed
may they be, that are vnnaturall, and may learne kindnesse
of a brute beast.  For such men being ouercome with <reg orig="kind-nesse">kindnesse</reg>

matter if they had bene vnthankful: but man can neuer escape
blame, seing God hath commaunded, and Nature hath graffed
this in al men: that they should do to other, as they would
be done vnto.  Againe, they for meate onely shewed them

audience, haue euer mo fooles to heare them, then wisemen to
giue iudgement: I would thinke it not amisse to speake
much, according to the nature and phansie of the ignorant,
that the rather they might be won through Fables, to learne
more weightie and graue matters, for all men can not brooke
sage causes, and auncient collations: but will like earnest <reg orig="mat-ters">matters</reg>
the rather, if some thing be spoken there among agreeing

ignorant (I warrant you) either fall a sleepe, or els bid you
farewell.  The multitude must needes be made merie: &amp; the
more foolish your talke is, the more wise will they compt it to
be.  And yet it is no foolishnesse, but rather wisedome to win
men, by telling of Fables to heare of Gods goodnesse.    <reg orig="Un-doubtedly">Undoubtedly</reg>
fables well set forth, haue done much good at diuers
times, and in diuers Commonweales.  The Romaine <emph>Menenius
Agrippa</emph>, alledging vpon a time, a Fable of the conflict made

marueilous stirre that was like to ensue, and pacified the <reg orig="vp-rore">vprore</reg>
of sedicious Rebelles, which els thought for euer to
destroy their Countrey.  <emph>Themistocles</emph> perswaded the <emph>Athenians</emph>
not to change their officers, by rehearsing the fable of a scabbed
Foxe.  For (quoth he) when many flies stoode feeding vppon
his rawe flesh, and had well fed themselues, he was contented
at an others perswasion, to haue them slapt awaie: whereupon
there ensued such hungrie flies afterwards, that the sorie Foxe
being all alone, was eaten vp almost to the hard bone, and
therefore cursed the time, that euer he greed to any such euil
counsaile.  In like maner (quoth <emph>Themistocles</emph>) if you will
chaunge officers, the hungrie flies will eate you vp one after
another, whereas now you liue being but onely bitten, and like

Again, sometimes feined narrations, and wittie inuented

Therefore it auaileth greatly, what bodies we

they keepe not long.  Again, they that be colde and drie, doe
hardly conceiue, but they keepe it surely when they once haue
it.  And the reason is this, heate beeing chiefe qualitie, doth
drawe thinges vnto it (as we may see by the Sunne) the which
notwithstanding are soner after dissipated and resolued.  Againe,
who hath seene a print made in water of any earthly thing?
Then -- though heate and moysture together drawe things vnto
them, yet, (wee see plainly) they cannot long hold them.  But
when the braine is cold and drie, things are therfore the faster
holden, because it is the propertie of colde and drought, to
thicken all things, and to harden them fast together, as we see
the water through coldnesse is congeled, and soft things are
frosen oftentimes: almost as hard as a stone.  So that moysture
through heate being chiefe qualitie, doth drawe: and drought
through coldnesse, which is chiefe contrary to heate, doth
harden and make thinges fast together.  But now how doe wee

The deuision of Memorie.</head>


<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Memorie deuided.</note>
MEmorie is partly naturall, and partly artificiall.  <reg orig="Natu-rall">Naturall</reg>
memorie, is when without any precepts or lessons,
by the onely aptnesse of nature, we beare away such thinges
as we heare.  Wherein some heretofore did much excell, and
greatly passe al other.  As <emph>Themistocles</emph>, who had so good a
<note place="marg" anchored="yes"><reg orig="Themisto-cles">Themistocles</reg>.</note>
memorie, that when one proffered to teach him the art of
Memorie: nay by Sainct Marie (quoth he) teach me rather the
arte of forgetting.  Declaring thereby that his memorie was
passing good, and that it was more plaine for him, to forget
such thinges as he would not kepe, then hard to remember
such things as he would knowe.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes"><reg orig="Mithri-dates">Mithridates</reg>.</note>
<emph>Mithridates</emph> also had such an excellent memorie, that <reg orig="where-as">whereas</reg>
he was Lorde and Ruler ouer xxii straunge Countries, that
speake diuers speeches from one an other: he was able to talke
with euery one of them in their owne countrey language.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Cyrus.</note>
Likewise <emph>Cyrus</emph> King of the <emph>Persians</emph>, hauing a great armie of
men, knewe the names of all his Souldiers.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Cyneas.</note>
<emph>Cyneas</emph> Ambassadour for King <emph>Pyrrhus</emph>, called euery one by
his name, that was in the Parliament house at Rome, the second
day after he came thether, the number of them being foure
times as many as they bee, that belong vnto the Parliament
here in England.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Iulius C&aelig;sar.</note>
<emph>Julius C&aelig;sar</emph> is reported that he could reade, heare, and tell
one what he should write, so fast as his penne could runne, and
endite Letters himselfe altogether at one time.</p>

<p>Thus we see that naturally men haue had wonderfull <reg orig="memo-ries">memories</reg>,
as contrariwise there haue bene heard of as straunge <reg orig="for-getful">forgetful</reg>
wittes.  Some hath not knowne his right hand from his
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Forgetfull wittes.</note>
left.  An other hath forgot his owne name.  An other hath
caried his knife in his mouth: and hath runne rounde about
the house seeking for it.  An other hath told a tale halfe an
houre together, and immediatly after hath forgot what he
spake all that while.</p>

<p><emph>Cicero</emph> telleth of one <emph>Curio</emph>, that where as he would make a
deuision of three parts, he would either forget the third, or
make vp a fourth, contrary to his first purpose and entent.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Belike this man had
the art of forgetting.</note>
This I remember beeing a boye, that where as a Preacher
had taken vpon him to set forth the twelue Articles of our <reg orig="be-lief">belief</reg>,
he could not in all the worlde finde out past nine: so

<pb n="212"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">212</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

that he was faine to say, he was assured there was twelue,
wheresoeuer the other three were become, and he doubted not
but the hearers knew them better then he did, and therefore
he would for his part say no more, but commit them al to God,
and those nine (thought he) were enough for him at that time,
to set foorth and expounde for their vnderstanding.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes"><reg orig="Preserua-tion">Preseruation</reg>
of memorie.</note>
Now the best meane both to amende an euill memorie, and
to preserue a good, is first to keepe a diet, and eschewe surfites,
to sleepe moderatly, to accompanie with women rarely, and
last of all to exercise the witte with cunning, of many thinges
without booke, and euer to be occupied with one thing or other.
For euen as by labour the witte is whetted, so by lithernesse
the witte is blounted.</p>

<p>But now concerning the other kinde of memorie called <reg orig="arti-ficiall">artificiall</reg>,
I had need to make a long discourse, considering the
strangenesse of the thing to the Englishe eare, and the <reg orig="hard-nesse">hardnesse</reg>
of the matter, to the ignorant and vnlearned.  But
first I wil shew from whence it hath beginning, and vpon what
occasion it was first inuented, before I aduenture to declare the
precepts that belong vnto the same.</p>

</div2>
<div2 type="subsection" n="The first founder of the art of Remembraunce."><head>The first founder of the art of Remembraunce.</head>
<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Simonides first
Authour of the
arte of <reg orig="remem-brance">remembrance</reg>.</note>
THE inuention of this Arte, is fathered vpon <emph>Simonides</emph>, for
when the same man (as the Fable recordeth) had made in
behalfe of a triumphant Champion called <emph>Scopas</emph>, for a certaine
somme of money a Ballade, such as was then wont to be
made for Conquerours: he was denied a peece of his reward,
because he made a digression in his song (which in those daies
was customably vsed) to the praise and commendation of
<emph>Castor</emph> &amp;  <emph>Pollux</emph> (who were then thought being Twinnes, &amp;
got by  <emph>Iupiter</emph> to be Gods) of whom the Champion willed him
to aske a portion, because he had so largely set forth their
worthy doings.  Now it chaunced, that where as there was
made a great feast, to the honour of the same Victorie, and
<emph>Simonides</emph> had beene placed there as a guest, he was sodainly
called from the Table, and told that there was two yong men
at the doore, and both on horsback, which desired most <reg orig="ear-nestly">earnestly</reg>
to speak with him out of hand.  But when he came out
of the doores, he saw none at all: notwithstanding, he was not
so sone out, and his foote on the Thresholde, but the Parlour
fell downe immediatly vpon them all that were there, and so

<pb n="213"/>

crushed their bodies together, and in such sort, that the <reg orig="kins-folke">kinsfolke</reg>
of those that were dead, comming in, and desirous to
burie them euery one according to their calling, not onely could
they not perceiue them by their faces, but also they could not
discerne them by any other marke of any part in all their bodies.
Then <emph>Simonides</emph> well remembring in what place euery one of
them did sit, tolde them what euery one was, and gaue them
their kinsfolkes carcases, so many as were there.  Thus the
arte was first inuented.  And yet (though this be but a Fable)
reason might beate thus much into our heades, that if the like
thing had bene done, the like remembrance might haue
bene vsed.  For who is he that seeth a dosen sit at a table,
whom he knoweth very wel, cannot tell after they are all risen,
where euery one of them did sit before?  And therefore, be it
that some man inuented this tale: the matter serueth well our
purpose, and what neede wee any more?</p>

<div2 type="subsection" n="What things are requisite to get the art of Memorie."><head>What things are requisite to get the art of Memorie.</head>
<p>THey that will remember many thinges, and rehearse them
together out of hand: must learne to haue places, and
digest Images in them accordingly.</p>

<div3 type="para"><head>A place what it is.</head>
<p>A place is called any roume, apt to receiue thinges.</p></div3>

<div3 type="para"><head>An Image what it is.</head>
<p>
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Places how they
must be.</note>
An Image is any Picture or shape, to declare some certaine
thing therby.  And euen as in waxe we make a print with a
seale, so we haue places where liuely pictures must be set.
The places must be great, of small distaunce, not one like an
other, and euermore the first place must bee made notable aboue
the rest, hauing alwaies some seuerall note from the other, as
some Antique, or a hand pointing, or such like, that the rather
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Images how they
must be.</note>
hauing a great number of places, wee might the better knowe
where wee are, by the remembraunce of such notable and
straunge places.  And thus hauing them well appointed, we
must keepe them fresh in our memorie, and neuer chaunge
them but vse them still, whatsoeuer we haue to say.  But the
Images we may chaunge, as the matter shal giue iust cause,
vsing such as shal serue best for the knowledge of thinges.
The which Images must bee set foorth, as though they were
stirring, yea, they must be sometimes made ramping, &amp; last of
al, they must be made of things notable, such as may cause



<pb n="214"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">214</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

earnest impression of things in our minde.  As a notable euill
fauoured man, or a monstrous Horse, such as Sainct Georges
Horse was wont to be, or any such like helpe well for <reg orig="remem-braunce">remembraunce</reg>.

<list type="ordered">
<item n="i">The places of Memorie are resembled vnto Waxe and Paper.</item>
<item n="ii">Images are compted like vnto Letters or a Seale.</item>
<item n="iii">The placing of these Images, is like vnto wordes written.</item>
<item n="iiii">The vtterance and vsing of them, is like vnto reading.</item>
</list></p>
<p>ANd therefore, as we doe reserue Paper, and yet chaunge
our writing, putting out wordes as occasion shall serue,
and setting other in their roume: so may we doe for the
Images inuented, chaunge our Picture oft, and reserue the
Papers stil.  Some gather their places &amp; Images out of the
Crosse rowe, beginning euery Letter with the name of some
Beast, and so goe through the whole, making in euery beast
fiue seueral places, where the impression of things shall bee
made, that is to say, in the Head, the Bellie, in the Taile, in
the former parte of the legges, &amp; also in the hinder part.
So that by this meanes there shall be gathered, an hundred and
fifteene places.  Some againe will set their places in his head
or bodie, with whom they speake.  As to make the nose, the
eyes, the forhead, the haire, the eares, and other partes to serue
for places.  And for making places in any house, Church, or
other roume, this lesson is also giuen, that we enter our first
places alwaies vpon the right hande, neuer returning backe:
but going on still as I might say in a Circuite, till we come to
that place where wee first began.  But first before the Images
bee inuented, the places must bee learned perfectly, and  <reg orig="there-fore">therefore</reg>
one giueth counsaile that we should goe into some solitarie
place where no companie is, and there make our places, <reg orig="walk-ing">walking</reg>
vp and doune fower or fiue times, and calling stil to our
remembrance what, and where the places are.  And not only
to doe this once or twise, but to labour in it two or three daies
at seueral times vntil we shalbe able to tel our places vpon
our fingers ends.</p>

<p>And now to make this hard matter somewhat plaine, I will

<pb n="215"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">215</fw>

vse an example.  My friend (whom I tooke euer to bee an
honest man) is accused of theft, of adulterie, of ryot, of <reg orig="man-slaughter">manslaughter</reg>,
and of treason: if I would keepe these wordes in my
remembrance, and rehearse them in order as they were spoken,
I must appoint fiue places, the which I had neede to haue so
perfectly in my memorie, as could be possible.  As for example,
I will make these in my Chamber.  A doore, a window, a
presse, a bedstead, and a chimney.  Now in the doore, I wil
set <emph>Cacus</emph> the theefe, or some such notable verlet.  In the <reg orig="win-dowe">windowe</reg>
I will place <emph>Venus</emph>.  In the Presse I will put <emph>Apitius</emph> that
famous Glutton.  In the Bedstead I will set Richard the third
King of England, or some notable murtherer.  In the Chimney
I will place the blacke Smith, or some other notable Traitour.
That if one repete these places, and these Images twise or thrise
together, no doubt though he haue but a meane memorie, he
shall carie away the wordes rehearsed with ease.  And like as
he may doe with these fiue words, so may he doe with fiue
score, if he haue places fresh in his remembraunce, and doe but
vse himselfe to this trade one fortnight together.</p>

<p>Therefore though it seeme straunge and foolish to them that
knowe it not, yet the learned haue taken this way, and doubt
not but maruailes may bee done, if one haue places readie made
for the purpose, and haue them fresh in his remembraunce.
For what other thing els do they that appoint Images in <reg orig="cer-taine">certaine</reg>
places made for that purpose, but write (as a man would
say) vpon Paper, that which is spoken vnto them?  What
maketh the old man (that for lacke of natural heate and <reg orig="moy-sture">moysture</reg>,
scant knoweth his right hand from his left) remember in
the morning where he laid his purse all night, but the beds
head which lightly is the appointed place for all mens purses,
especially such as bee wayfairers, and haue but little store.
Shal some Gentleman play blindfold at the Chesse, and cannot
a learned man be able to rehearse vp a score or two of straunge
names together.  A Neteheard hauing the charge and keeping
of twentie score head of Beastes in a wilde Fenne, that belong
to diuers men, will not only tell who be the owners of al such
cattel, but also he will shew a man twise a weeke where any
one is feeding, and if he want one among the whole, he will
tell immediatly what it is, and whose it is that is wanting.
Then fonde are they that coumpt the Arte of memorie so hard,

<pb n="216"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="pageno">216</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>

seeing they will neither proue the hardnesse of it, nor yet blush
at the matter, when they see poore Neteheards goe so farre <reg orig="be-yond">beyond</reg>
them.  How many thinges doth memorie containe <reg orig="mar-ueilous">marueilous</reg>
to beholde, and much more would, if we were not
altogether slouthfull, and as carelesse to keepe, as wee are to
get, good things I meane, not goodes of this world.  Euery
Artificer hath through exercise and labour, an artificiall <reg orig="mem-orie">memorie</reg>,
sauing the learned man onely, who hath most neede of it
aboue all other.</p>

<p>When we come to a place where we haue not bene many a
day before, wee remember not onely the place it selfe, but by
the place, wee call to remembraunce many thinges done there.
Yea somtimes a window maketh some remember, that they
haue stolne in their daies some thing out of it.  Somtimes a
chimney telleth them of many late drinkinges and sitting vp by
the fire.  Sometimes a Bedstead putteth them in remembraunce
of many good morowes: sometimes a doore, &amp; somtimes a
parler.  Thus we see places euen without Images, helpe oft
the memorie, much more then shall we remember, if we haue
both places and Images.</p>

<p>But now, because I haue halfe wearied the Reader with a
tedious matter, I will harten him againe with a mery tale.
At the time of rebellion in Northfolke, there was a Priest
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">God graunt all
Rebelles like
<reg orig="re-mem">remem</reg>&lt;!-&gt;brance.</note>
among all other, adiudged to die vpon a Gibet in a greene
place, a little from the high way side.  This Priest seeing the
place at his last ende, stood a while musing with himselfe, and
said to the companie there.  Now Lorde God what a thing
is this.  It comes to my remembraunce now, that about  <reg orig="fower-teene">fowerteene</reg>
yeares past, I was merrie here vpon this bancke, with
an other Priest, and wallowing me downe vpon the grasse, I
saied these words: <emph>H&aelig;c requies mea in -- s&aelig;culum s&aelig;culi, hic habitabo
quoniam elegi eam</emph>.  The which Sentence being a Psalme of
Dauid, is nothing els in English: But this is my resting place
for euer and euer, here shall be my dwelling, because I haue
chosen it.  And now (quoth he) I finde it to bee ouer true, so
that I thinke it bee Gods will I should die, and therfore I take
it in good worth, and thus I desire you al to pray for me.
Thus we see that the place brought him in remembrance of
a sentence, spoken fowerteene yeares before.</p>

<p>Therefore, this knowledge is not to bee neglected, no though

<pb n="217"/>
<fw place="top-left" type="head">The arte of Rhetorique.</fw>
<fw place="top-right" type="pageno">217</fw>

wee doe contemne it, yet we haue the vse of it.  For if we be
fully disposed to remember a thing, wee doe call vp the <reg orig="mem-orie">memorie</reg>,
and stirre it to minde thinges there vnto.  As if one bee
called Wingfeelde, and I feare to forget this name, I might <reg orig="re-member">remember</reg>
the wing of a birde, and a greene feelde to walke in.
<note place="marg" anchored="yes"><reg orig="Remem-braunce">Remembraunce</reg> by things like.</note>
Sometimes we remember the whole, by keeping in minde some
parte of a word.  As when one is called Crowcroft, I might
by remembring of a Crowe, the rather minde his name.  <reg orig="Not-withstanding">Notwithstanding</reg>
there bee some (among whom is <emph>Erasmus</emph>) which
like not this Art of Memorie, but say it rather hindereth then
helpeth a mans wit.  And yet <emph>Tullie</emph> the greatest Orator
among the Romaines, did well allowe it, and proued it good
by a natural reason.  For where as we knowe some things
(saieth he) onely by vnderstanding, and some by the sence of
seeing, those wee keepe best in our mindes, which we know
by sight, and haue marked with our eyes.  As for example.
When I see a Lyon, the Image thereof abideth faster in my
minde, then if I should heare some report made of a Lyon.
Among all the sences, the eye sight is most quicke, and <reg orig="con-teineth">conteineth</reg>
the impression of things more assuredly, then any of the
other sences doe.  And the rather when a man both heareth
and seeth a thing (as by artificiall memorie, he doth almost see
thinges liuely[)], hee doth remember it much the beter.  The sight
printeth thinges in a mans memorie, as a Seale doth print a
mans name in Waxe.  And therefore, heretofore Images were
set vp for remembrance of Saincts, to be Lay mens bookes,
that the rather by seing the Pictures of such men, they might
be stirred to follow their good liuing.  The which surely had
beene well done, if G O D had not forbidden it.  But seeing
thinges must be done, not of a good entent, but euen as G O D
hath commaunded, it is well done that such Idolles are cleane
taken out of the Church.  Mary for this purpose whereof wee
now write, they would haue serued gaiely well.  Thus the art
is sone tolde, but the practise of it is all.  And therefore, if one
desire to excell herein, let him take paines to gather his places
together, and keepe them well in remembraunce, prouing by
halfe a score, how he shalbe able to vse a hundred.  And no
doubt, but time and exercise shall make him perfect.
For the best art of memorie that can be, is to heare much,
to speak much, to reade much, and to write much.  And

<pb n="218"/>

exercise it is that doth al, when we haue saied all that euer
we can.</p></div3>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Vtteraimce what it is.</note>
PRonunciation is an apt ordering, both of the voyce, <reg orig="coun-tenaunce">countenaunce</reg>,

of such wordes and matter, as by speech are declared.

better learning.  The tongue giueth a certaine grace to euery
matter, and beautifieth the cause in like maner, as a sweete
sounding Lute, much setteth forth a meane deuised Ballad.
Or as the sounde of a good instrument stirreth the hearers, and

comely iesture of his bodie.  <emph>&AElig;schines</emph> likewise, beeing banished

whereof he was banished, and all they marueiled much at the

softly, vse meete pausing, and being somewhat heated, rise
with their voyce, as time and cause shall best require.  They
that haue no good voyces by nature, or cannot well vtter their
wordes, must seeke for helpe els where.  Exercise of the bodie,
fasting, moderation in meate and drinke, gaping wide, or
singing plaine Song, and counterfeyting those that doe speake
distinctly, helpe much to haue a good deliueraunce.  <emph><reg orig="Demos-thenes">Demosthenes</reg></emph>

could doe.  Musicians in England haue vsed to put gagges in

now with the losse and lacke of Musick, the loue also is gone
of bringing vp children to speake plainly.  Some there bee
that either naturally, or through folly haue such euill voyces,
<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Faultes in

and such lacke of vtteraunce, and such euill iesture, that it
much defaceth all their doinges.  One pipes out his wordes so
small, through default of his winde pipe, that ye would thinke
he whistled.  An other is hource in his throte, that a man
would thinke, he came lately from scouring of Harnesse.  An
other speakes, as though he had Plummes in his mouth.  An
other speakes in his throte, as though a good Ale crumme stucke
fast.  An other rattles his wordes.  An other choppes his

his words should bee weighed in a Ballaunce.  An other gapes

speakes so finely, as though he were brought vp in a Ladies
Chamber.  As I knewe a Priest that was as nice as a Nunnes
Henne, when hee would say Masse, he would neuer say <emph>Dominus

Dawe.  Some speakes as though they should tell in their sleeue.
Some cries out so loude, that they would make a mans eares
ake to heare them.  Some coughes at euery worde.  Some hems
it out.  Some spittes fire, they talke so hotly.  Some makes a
wrie mouth, and so they wrest out their wordes.  Some whines
like a Pigge.  Some suppes their wordes vp, as a poore man
doth his Porrage.  Some noddes their head at euery sentence.
An other winkes with one eye, &amp; some with both.  This man
frouneth alwaies when he speakes.  And other lookes euer as
though hee were mad.  Some cannot speake but they must goe
vp and downe, or at the least be stirring their feete, as though
they stood in a cockering Boate.  An other will play with his
cappe in his hand, and so tell his tale.  Some when they speake
in a great companie, will looke all one way, as I knewe a
Reader in my daies, who looked in like sorte, when hee read to
Scholers, whom one thought to disapoint of such his constaunt
lookes: and therefore against the next day, he painted the
Deuill with hornes vpon his head, in the self same place, where
the Reader was wont alwaies to looke, the which straunge
Monster, when the Reader sawe, he was half abashed, and
turned his face an other way.  Some pores vpon the ground
as though they sought for pinnes.    <emph>Tullie</emph> telles of one <emph><reg orig="Theo-phrastus">Theophrastus</reg>
Tauriscus</emph>, who is saied to declaime arsee versee.  Some
swelles in the face, and filles their cheekes full of winde, as
though they would blowe out their wordes.  Some sets forth
their lippes, two inches good beyond their teeth.  Some talkes
as though their tongue went of pattines.  Some shewes all
their teeth.  Some speakes in their teeth altogether.  Some
lets their wordes fall in their lippes, scant opening them when
they speake.  There are a thousand such faultes among men,
both for their speech, and also for their iesture, the which if in
their young yeares they bee not remedied, they will hardly
bee forgot when they come to mans state.  But the rather that
these faultes may be redressed: I haue partly declared <reg orig="hereto-fore">heretofore</reg>,
the right vse of vtteraunce.  And now I minde by Gods
helpe to shewe the right vse of iesture.</p>

<note place="marg" anchored="yes">Iesture,
what it is.</note>
IEsture is a certaine comely moderation of the countenance,
and al other parts of mans bodie, aptly agreeing to those

things which are spoken. That if we shal speake in a pleasaunt
matter, it is meete that the looke also should bee cherefull,
and all the iesture stirring thereafter.  The head to bee holden
vpright, the forehead without frowning, the browes without
bending, the nose without blowing, the eyes quicke and
pleasant, the lippes not laied out, the teeth without grenning,
the armes not much cast abroade, but comely set out, as time
and cause shall best require: the handes sometimes opened,
and sometimes holden together, the fingers pointing, the
breast laied out, and the whole bodie stirring altogether, with
a seemely moderation.  By the which behauiour of our bodie
after such a sorte, we shall not onely delite men with the sight,
but perswade them the rather the trueth of our cause.</p>

<p><note place="marg" anchored="yes">Hortensius.</note>
<emph>Q. Hortensius</emph> had such delite to vse comely gesture, and had
such grace in that behalfe: that I doubt whether men had a
greater desire to see him, then they had to heare him.  His
countenaunce so well agreed with his wordes, and his words
were so meete for his countenance: that not onely hee did
please the iudgement of his hearers, and contented their minde:
but also he pleased their eyes, and delited their eares, so much
as could be wished.</p>

<p><emph>Tullie</emph> saieth well: The gesture of man[] is the speech of his
bodie, and therefore reason it is, that like as the speeche must
agree to the mater, so must also the gesture agree to the minde,
for the eyes are not giuen to man onely to see, but also to
shewe and set forth the meaning of his minde, euen as vnto a
Bore, are giuen briselles: To a Lion, the taile: To a Horse,
his eares: whereby their inclinations and sodaine affections

<hi rend="center">are sone espied.  When wee see a man looke redde<lb/>
in the eyes, his browes bent, his teeth byting his<lb/>
vpper lippe, we iudge that he is out of pacience.<lb/>
Therefore as we ought to haue good regard,<lb/>
for the vtterance of our words, so wee<lb/>
ought to take heede that our <reg orig="ge-sture">gesture</reg><lb/>
be comely, the which<lb/>
both being well obserued,<lb/>
shall encrease fame,<lb/>
and get <reg orig="estima-tion">estimation</reg><lb/>
