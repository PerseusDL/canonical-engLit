				<head>PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.</head>

				<pb n="xxi"/>

				<p>THE success which has attended the First and Second Editions of the
						<title>SHAKESPEARIAN GRAMMAR,</title> and the demand for a Third Edition
					within a year of the publication of the First, has encouraged the Author to
					endeavour to make the work somewhat more useful, and to render it, as far as
					possible, a complete book of reference for all difficulties of Shakespearian
					syntax or prosody. For this purpose the whole of Shakespeare has been re-read,
					and an attempt has been made to include within this Edition the explanation of
					every idiomatic difficulty (where the text is not confessedly corrupt) that
					comes within the province of a grammar as distinct from a glossary. </p>
				<p>The great object being to make a useful book of reference for students, and
					especially for classes in schools, several Plays have been indexed so fully that
					with the aid of a glossary and historical notes the references will serve for a
					complete commentary. These Plays are, <bibl n="shak. ayl">As You Like It</bibl>,
						<bibl n="shak. cor">Coriolanus</bibl>, <bibl n="shak. ham">Hamlet</bibl>,
						<bibl n="shak h5">Henry V.</bibl>, <bibl n="shak. jc">Julius
						C&oelig;sar</bibl>, <bibl n="shak. lr">Lear</bibl>, <bibl n="shak. mac"
						>Macbeth</bibl>, <bibl n="shak. mv">Merchant of Venice</bibl>, <bibl
						n="shak. mnd">Midsummer Night's Dream</bibl>, <bibl n="shak. r2">Richard
						II.</bibl>, <bibl n="shak. r3">Richard III.</bibl>, <bibl n="shak. tmp"
						>Tempest</bibl>, <bibl n="shak. tn">Twelfth Night</bibl>. <note
						resp="transcr" anchored="yes">These indices have been omitted in the
						electronic edition.</note> It is hoped that these copious indexes will meet
					a want, by giving some definite work to be prepared by the class, whether as a
					holiday task or in the work of the term. The want of some such distinct work, to
					give thoroughness and definiteness <pb n="xxii"/>to an English lesson, has been
					felt by many teachers of experience. A complete table of the contents of each
					paragraph has been prefixed, together with a Verbal Index at the end. The
					indexes may be of use to students of a more advanced stage, and perhaps may
					occasionally be found useful to the general reader of Shakespeare. </p>
				<p>A second perusal of Shakespeare, with a special reference to idiom and prosody,
					has brought to light several laws which regulate many apparent irregularities.
					The interesting distinction between <mentioned>thou</mentioned> and
						<mentioned>you</mentioned> (Pars. 231--235), for example, has not hitherto
					attracted the attention of readers, or, as far as I am aware, of commentators on
					Shakespeare. The use of the relative with plural antecedent and singular verb
					(Par. 246); the prevalence of the third person plural in
						<mentioned>-s</mentioned> (Par. 333), which does not appear in modern
					editions of Shakespeare; the "confusion of proximity" (Par. 412); the
					distinction between an adjective before and after a noun; these and many other
					points which were at first either briefly or not at all discussed, have
					increased the present to more than thrice the size of the original book. I
					propose now to stereotype this edition, so that no further changes need be
					anticipated. </p>
				<p>It may be thought that the amplification of the Prosody is unnecessary, at all
					events, for the purpose of a school-book. My own experience, however, leads me
					to think that the Prosody of Shakespeare has peculiar interest for boys, and
					that some training in it is absolutely necessary if they are to read Shakespeare
						<emph>critically.</emph> The additions which have been made to this part of
					the book have sprung naturally out of the lessons in English which I have been
					in the habit of giving; and as they are the results of practical experience, I
					am confident they will be found useful for school <pb n="xxiii"/>purposes.<note
						anchored="yes">The somewhat grotesque name of "amphibious verse" (Par. 513)
						sprang in this way from class-teaching. I have retained it, as answering its
						purpose, by communicating its meaning readily and impressively.</note> A
					conjectural character, more apparent however than real, has perhaps been given
					to this part of the book from the necessity that I felt of setting down
						<emph>every difficult verse of Shakespeare</emph> where the text was not
					acknowledged as corrupt, or where the difficulty was more than slight.
					Practically, I think, it will be found that the rules of the Prosody will be
					found to solve most of the difficulties that will present themselves to boys--at
					least, in the thirteen Plays above mentioned. </p>
				<p>Besides obligations mentioned in the First Edition, I must acknowledge the great
					assistance I have received from <bibl><author>M&Auml;TZNER</author>'S
							<title>Englische Grammatik</title> (3 vols., Berlin,
						<date>1865</date>)</bibl>, whose enormous collection of examples deserves
					notice. I am indebted to the same author for some points illustrating the
					connection between Early and Elizabethan English. Here, however, I have received
					ample assistance from <name>Mr. F. J. Furnivall</name>, <name>Mr. R.
						Morris</name>, and others, whose kindness I am glad to have an opportunity
					of mentioning. In particular, I must here acknowledge my very great obligation
					to the <name>Rev. W. W. Skeat</name>, late Fellow of Christ's College,
					Cambridge, whose excellent edition of <bibl><title>William of Palerne</title>
							(<publisher>Early English Text Society</publisher>,
						<date>1867</date>)</bibl>, and whose <bibl><title>M&oelig;so-Gothic
							Dictionary</title> (<publisher>Asher</publisher>, London,
							<date>1866</date>)</bibl>, have been of great service to me. <name>Mr.
						Skeat</name> also revised the whole of the proof-sheets, and many of his
					suggestions are incorporated in the present work. I may add here, that in
					discussing the difference between <mentioned>thou</mentioned> and
						<mentioned>you</mentioned> (231-5), and the <mentioned>monosyllabic
						foot</mentioned> (480-6), I was not aware that I had been anticipated by
						<name>Mr. Skeat</name>, who has illustrated the former point (with reference
					to Early English) in <bibl><title>William of Palerne,</title> p. xlii.</bibl>,
						<pb n="xxiv"/>and the latter in his <bibl><title>Essay on the Metres of
							Chaucer</title> (vol. i., Aldine Edition, London,
						<date>1866</date>)</bibl>. The copious <bibl><title>Index to
							Layamon,</title></bibl> edited by <name>Sir Frederick Madden</name>, has
					also been of great service. I trust that, though care has been taken to avoid
					any unnecessary parade of Anglo-Saxon, or Early English, that might interfere
					with the distinct object of the work, the information on these points will be
					found trust-worthy and useful. The Prosody has been revised throughout by
						<name>Mr. A. J. Ellis</name>, whose work on Early English Pronunciation is
					well known. <name>Mr. Ellis</name>'s method of scansion and notation is not in
					all respects the same as my own, but I have made several modifications in
					consequence of his suggestive criticisms. </p>
				<p>I have now only to express my hope that this little book may do something to
					forward the development of English instruction in English schools. Taking the
					very lowest ground, I believe that an intelligent study of English is the
					shortest and safest way to attain to an intelligent and successful study of
					Latin and Greek, and that it is idle to expect a boy to grapple with a sentence
					of <name>Plato</name> or <name>Thucydides</name> if he cannot master a passage
					of <name>Shakespeare</name> or a couplet of <name>Pope</name>. Looking,
					therefore, at the study of English from the old point of view adopted by those
					who advocate a purely classical instruction, I am emphatically of opinion that
					it is a positive gain to classical studies to deduct from them an hour or two
					every week for the study of English. But I need scarcely say that the time seems
					not far off when every English boy who continues his studies to the age of
					fifteen will study English for the sake of English; and where English is studied
						<name>Shakespeare</name> is not likely to be forgotten. </p>

				<head>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.</head>
				<pb n="1"/>


				<p>THE object of this work is to furnish students of Shakespeare and Bacon with a
					short systematic account of some points of difference between Elizabethan syntax
					and our own. The <emph>words</emph> of these authors present but little
					difficulty. They can be understood from glossaries, and, even without such aid,
					a little reflection and attention to the context will generally enable us to hit
					the meaning. But the <emph>differences of idiom</emph> are more perplexing. They
					are more frequent than mere verbal difficulties, and they are less obvious and
					noticeable. But it need hardly be said, that if we allow ourselves to fancy we
					are studying Shakespeare critically, when we have not noticed and cannot explain
					the simplest Shakespearian idiom, we are in danger of seriously lowering our
					standard of accurate study, and so far from training we are untraining our
					understanding. Nor is it enough to enumerate unusual idioms without explaining
					them. Such is not the course we pursue in Latin and Greek, and our native tongue
					should either not be studied critically at all, or be studied as thoroughly as
					the languages of antiquity. <note place="foot" resp="auth" anchored="yes">Of
						course it is possible to study Shakespeare with great advantage, and yet
						without any reference to textual criticism. Only, it should be distinctly
						under-stood in such cases that textual criticism is not attempted.</note>
				</p>
				<p>The difficulty which the author has experienced in teaching pupils to read
					Shakespearian verse correctly, and to analyse a metaphorical expression, has
					induced him to add a few pages on Shakespeare's prosody and on the use of simile
					and metaphor. <pb n="2"/>
				</p>
				<p>A very important question in the study of English is, what should be the amount
					and nature of the assistance given to students in the shape of notes. It is
					clear that the mere getting up and reproducing a commentator's opinions, though
					the process may fill a boy with useful information, can in no sense be called a
					training. In the Notes and Questions at the end of this volume I have tried to
					give no more help than is absolutely necessary. The questions may be of use as a
					holiday-task, or in showing the student how to work the Grammar. They have been
					for the most part answered by a class of boys from fourteen to sixteen years
					old, and some by boys much younger. </p>
				<p>In some of the sections of the Prosody I must acknowledge my obligations to
						<name>Mr. W. S. Walker's</name> work on Shakespeare's Versification. <note
						place="foot" resp="auth" anchored="yes">In correcting the proof-sheets I
						have gained much from consulting <name>Mr. Walker's</name>
						<bibl><title>Criticisms on Shakespeare.</title></bibl></note> Other
					obligations are acknowledged in the course of the work; but the great mass of
					the examples have been collected in the course of several years' close study of
					Shakespeare and contemporaneous authors. I am aware that there will be found
					both inaccuracies and incompleteness in this attempt to apply the rules of
					classical scholarship to the criticism of Elizabethan English, but it is perhaps
					from a number of such imperfect contributions that there will at last arise a
					perfect English Grammar. </p>

				<p>ELIZABETHAN English, on a superficial view, appears to present this great point
					of difference from the English of modern times, that in the former any

					of words into sentences, are allowable. In the first place, almost any part of
					speech can be used as any other part of speech. An adverb can be used as a verb,

						<bibl n="shak. son">(<title><abbr>Sonn.</abbr></title>)</bibl></cit>. Any

						<gloss>happy</gloss> your friend, <gloss>malice</gloss> or
						<gloss>foot</gloss> your enemy, or <gloss>fall</gloss> an axe on his neck.
					An adjective can be used as an adverb; and you can speak and act

				<p>On a more careful examination, however, these apparently disorderly and
					inexplicable anomalies will arrange themselves under certain heads. It must be
					remembered that the Elizabethan was a transitional period in the history of the
					English language. On the one hand, there was the influx of new discoveries and
					new thoughts requiring as their equivalent the coinage of new words (especially
					words expressive of abstract ideas); on the other hand, the revival of classical
					studies and the popularity of translations from Latin and Greek authors <pb
						n="7"/> suggested Latin and Greek words (but principally Latin) as the
					readiest and most malleable metal, or rather as so many ready-made coins
					requiring only a slight national stamp to prepare them for the proposed
					augmentation of the currency of the language. Moreover, the long and rounded
					periods of the ancients commended themselves to the ear of the Elizabethan
					authors. In the attempt to conform English to the Latin frame, the constructive
					power of the former language was severely strained. </p>
				<p>The necessity of avoiding ambiguity and the difficulty of connecting the end of a
					long sentence with the beginning, gave rise to some irregularities, to the
					redundant pronoun (<ref target="par242" targOrder="U">242</ref>), the redundant
						&lsquo;<mentioned>that</mentioned>&rsquo; (<ref target="par285"
						targOrder="U">285</ref>), and the irregular
					&lsquo;<mentioned>to</mentioned>&rsquo; (<ref target="par416" targOrder="U"
						>416</ref>). </p>
				<p>But, for the most part, the influence of the classical languages was confined to
					single words, and to the rhythm of the sentence. The <emph>syntax</emph> was
					mostly English both in its origin and its development, and several constructions
					that are now called anomalous (such as the double negative [<ref target="par406"
						targOrder="U">406</ref>] and the double comparative [<ref target="par409"
						targOrder="U">409</ref>]) have, and had from the earliest period, an
					independent existence in English, and are merely the natural results of a spirit
					which preferred clearness and vigour of expression to logical symmetry. Many of
					the anomalies above mentioned may be traced back to some peculiarities of Early
					English, modified by the transitional Elizabethan period. Above all, it must be
					remembered that Early English was far richer than Elizabethan English in
					inflections. As far as English inflections are concerned the Elizabethan period
					was destructive rather than constructive. Naturally, therefore, while
					inflections were being discarded, all sorts of tentative experiments were made:
					some inflections were discarded that we have restored, others retained that we
					have discarded. Again, sometimes where inflections were retained the sense of
					their meaning and power had been lost, and at other times the memory of
					inflections that were no longer visibly expressed in writing still influenced
					the manner of expression. Thus <name>Ben Jonson</name> writes:-- <pb n="8"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<quote>The persons plural keep the termination of the first person singular. In
						former times, till about the reign of King Henry VIII. they were wont to be
						formed by adding <mentioned>en</mentioned> thus:--Lov<hi rend="italics"
							>en,</hi> say<hi rend="italics">en,</hi> complain<hi rend="italics"
							>en.</hi> But now (whatsoever is the cause) it is quite grown out of
						use, and that other so generally prevailed that I dare not presume to set
						this on foot again.</quote>
				</p>
				<p>He appears to be aware of the Midland plural in <mentioned>en</mentioned> (<ref
						target="par332" targOrder="U">332</ref>) which is found only very rarely in
					Spenser and in <bibl n="shak. per">Pericles of Tyre,</bibl> but not of the
					Northern plural in <mentioned>es</mentioned> (<ref target="par333" targOrder="U"
						>333</ref>), which is very frequently found in Shakespeare, and which
					presents the apparent anomaly of a plural noun combined with a singular verb.
					And the same author does not seem to be aware of the existence of the
					subjunctive mood in English. He ignores it in his <title>Etymology of a
						Verb,</title> and, in the chapter on <title>Syntax of a Verb with a
						Noun,</title> writes as follows:-- </p>
				<p>
					<quote>Nouns signifying a multitude, though they be of the singular number,
						require a verb plural: <cit><quote>'And wise men rehearsen in sentence,<lb/>
								Where folk be drunken there is no resistance.'</quote>
							<bibl><name>LYDGATE,</name> lib. ii.</bibl></cit></quote>
				</p>
				<p>And he continues thus:--<quote>This exception is <emph>in other nouns also very
							common, especially when the verb is joined to an adverb or
							conjunction:</emph>
						<gloss>It is preposterous to execute a man before he
								<mentioned>have</mentioned> been condemned.</gloss></quote> It would
					appear hence that the dramatist was ignorant of the force of the inflection of
					the subjunctive, though he frequently uses it. Among the results of inflectional

										<gloss>he <emph>would</emph> find,</gloss>
										<gloss>that he <emph>may</emph> see,</gloss>--and the
										subjunctive inflection is restricted to a few phrases with
											<gloss>if.</gloss>
										<gloss>To walk</gloss> is now either (1) a noun, or (2)
										denotes a purpose, <gloss>in order to walk.</gloss> In
										Elizabethan English, <gloss><emph>to</emph> walk</gloss>
										might also denote <gloss><emph>by</emph> walking,</gloss>
										<gloss><emph>as regards</emph> walking,</gloss>
										<gloss><emph>for</emph> walking;</gloss> a licence now
										discarded, except in one or two common phrases, such as
											<gloss>I am happy <emph>to</emph> say,</gloss> &amp;c.
										Similarly, Shakespeare could write <gloss><emph>of</emph>

									<p>As a rule, then, the tendency of the English language has

										the Victorian idiom is clearer but less terse than the
										corresponding Elizabethan idiom which it has
									supplanted.</p> </item><item n="7">The character
							of Elizabethan English is impressed upon its pronunciation, as well as
							upon its idioms and words. As a rule their pronunciation seems to have
							been more rapid than ours. Probably the greater influence of spoken as
							compared with written English, sanctioned many contractions which would
							now be judged intolerable if for the first time introduced. <ref
								target="par461" targOrder="U">(See 461.)</ref> This, however, does
							not explain the singular variation of accent upon the same words in the
							same author. Why should "exile," "aspect," "confessor," and many other
							words, be accented now on the first, now on the second syllable? The
							answer is, that during the unsettled Elizabethan period the foreign
							influence was contending with varying success against the native rules
							of English pronunciation. The English rule, as given by Ben Jonson, is
							definite enough. "In dissyllabic simple nouns" (by which it is to be
							supposed he means un-compounded), "the accent is on the first, as
							'b&eacute;lief,' 'h&oacute;nour,' &amp;c." But he goes on to say, that
							"all verbs coming from the Latin, either of the supine or otherwise,
							hold the accent as it is found in the first person present of those
							Latin verbs." Hence a continual strife over every noun derived from
							Latin participles: the English language claiming the new comer as her
							naturalized subject, bound by English laws; the Latin, on the <pb n="12"
							/>other hand, asserting a partial jurisdiction over her emigrants. Hence
								<mentioned>acc&eacute;ss</mentioned> and

								<mentioned>rel&aacute;pse</mentioned> and

						<item n="8"><p><emph>Words then used literally are now used
											metaphorically, and vice vers&acirc;.</emph>
									</p>
									<p>The effect of this is most apparent in the altered use of
										prepositions. For instance, <mentioned>by,</mentioned>
										originally meaning <gloss>near,</gloss> has supplanted
											<mentioned>of</mentioned> in the metaphorical sense of
											<emph>agency,</emph> as it may in its turn be supplanted
										by <mentioned>with</mentioned> or some other preposition.
										This is discussed more fully under the head of prepositions
											(<ref target="par138" targOrder="U">138</ref>). Here a
										few illustrations will be given from other words. It is not
										easy to discover a defined law regulating changes of
										metaphor. There is no reason why we should not, with
										Beaumont and Fletcher, talk of living at a
												<quote><mentioned>deep</mentioned>
											<note resp="auth" anchored="yes"><quote>How brave lives
												he that keeps a fool, although the rate be

												cheaper.</quote></note> rate</quote> as well as a
												<quote><mentioned>high</mentioned> rate.</quote> But
										it will be found with respect to many words derived from
										Latin and Greek, that <emph>the Elizabethans used them
											literally and generally; we, metaphorically and
											particularly.</emph> Thus "metaphysical" was used by
										Shakespeare in the broader meaning of "supernatural;" and
										"fantastical" could be applied even to a murder, in the wide
										sense of "imagined." So "exorbitant" was <gloss>out of the
											path,</gloss>
										<gloss>uncommon;</gloss> now only <pb n="13"/> applied to
										that which is uncommonly "expensive." So
											<mentioned>extravagant</mentioned> ( <cit><quote><l>The
												<mentioned>extravagant</mentioned> and erring
												spirit,</l></quote><bibl n="shak. ham 1.1.154"
												><title>Hamlet,</title> i. 1</bibl></cit> ) has
										been restricted to <quote><mentioned>wandering</mentioned>
											beyond the bounds of economy.</quote> "To aggravate" now
										means, except when applied to disease, "to add to the mental
										burdens of any one," hence "to vex;" but in <bibl
											n="shak. son 146"><title>Sonn.</title> 146</bibl> we
										find <quote>to aggravate thy store</quote> in the literal
										sense of <gloss>to add to the weight of</gloss> or
											<gloss>increase.</gloss> So
											<mentioned>journall</mentioned> meant
											<gloss>diurnal</gloss> or <gloss>daily;</gloss> now it
										is restricted to a "daily" newspaper or memoir. The fact is
										that, in the influx of Greek and Latin words into the
										English language, many were introduced to express ideas that
										either could be, or were already, expressed in the existing
										vocabulary. Thus we do not require "metaphysical" to express
										that which is supernatural, nor "fantastical" to express
										that which is imagined; "exorbitant" is unnecessary in the
										sense of "uncommon;" "extravagant" (though it has a special
										force in <cit><quote><l>the
												<mentioned>extravagant</mentioned> and erring
												spirit,</l></quote>
											<bibl n="shak. ham 1.1.154"><title>Hamlet,</title> i.
												1</bibl></cit>) is not in most cases so obvious as
										"wandering;" "increase" is simpler than "aggravate," and
										"daily" more English than "diurnal." Similarly "speculation"
										is unnecessary to express the power of seeing, "advertised"
										useless in the sense of "warned" or "informed" (<bibl
											n="shak. lr 4.6.214"><title>Lear,</title> iv. 6.
											214</bibl>), "vulgar" in the sense of common. Such
										words, once introduced into the language, finding the
										broader room which they had been intended to fill already
										occupied, were forced to take narrower meanings. They did
										this, for the most part, by confining themselves to one out
										of many meanings which they had formerly represented, or by
										adopting metaphorical and philosophical instead of literal
										and material significations; and as the sense of their
										derivation and original meaning became weaker, the
										transition became easier. This is not merely true of words
										derived from Latin and Greek. "Travail," for example,
										finding itself supplanted in its original sense by "work" or
										"labour," has narrowed itself to a special meaning: the same
										is true of "beef," "pork," &amp;c. </p>
									<p>On the other hand, some Latin and Greek words that <pb n="14"
										/> express technicalities have, as the sense of their exact
										meaning was weakened, gradually become more loosely and
										generally used. Thus, "influence" means now more than the
										mere influence of the stars on men; "triumph,"
										"preposterous," "pomp," "civil," "ovation," and "decimate,"
										have lost much of their technical meaning. Of these words it
										may be said, that Shakespeare uses them more literally and
										particularly than we do. Thus, "triumph" is used for a show
										at a festival; "civil" is used for peaceful;

									</p>
									<p>One cause that has affected the meaning of Latin-derived
										words has been the preference with which they have been
										selected in order to express depreciation. This has narrowed
										some words to an unfavourable signification which they did
										not originally possess. Thus, "impertinent" in Elizabethan
										authors meant <gloss>not to the point;</gloss> "officious"
										could then mean <gloss>obliging,</gloss> and a clever person
										could be described as <cit><quote><l>an admirable conceited
												fellow</l></quote>
											<bibl n="shak. wt 4.4.203">(<title>W. T.</title> iv. 4.
												203)</bibl></cit>. </p>
									<p>A classical termination (<ref target="par446" targOrder="U"
											>446</ref>) may sometimes be treated as active or as
										passive. Hence "plausibly" is used for <gloss>with
											applause</gloss> actively. <cit><quote><l>The Romans

											8</bibl>), and on the other the more common passive
										sense, as "the inexpres<emph>sive</emph> she" (the woman
										whose praises cannot be expressed). </p>
									<p>With respect to words of English or French origin, it is more
										difficult to establish any rule. All that can be said is
										that the Elizabethan, as well as the Victorian meaning, may
										be traced to the derivation of the word. Why, for instance,
										should not Ben Jonson write-- <cit><quote>Frost fearing
												myrtle shall <mentioned>impale</mentioned> my
												head.</quote>
											<bibl><title>Poetast.</title> i. 1.</bibl></cit>
										<pb n="15"/>
										<hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi>
										<gloss>take in within its pale, surround,</gloss> as
										justifiably as we use the word in its modern sense of
										"transfixing?" Why should not sirens "train"
											(<mentioned>draw</mentioned> or decoy--<foreign
											lang="la">trahere</foreign>) their victims to
										destruction, as well as educators "train" their pupils
										onward on the path of knowledge? We talk of <gloss>a
												<emph>world</emph> of trouble</gloss> to signify an
										infinity; why should not Bacon
												<bibl>(<title><abbr>E.</abbr></title> 38)</bibl>
										talk of "a <emph>globe</emph> of precepts?" Owing to the
										deficiency of their vocabulary, and their habit of combining
										prepositions with verbs, to make distinct words almost like
										the Germans, the Elizabethans used to employ many common
										English words, such as "pass," "hold," "take," in many
										various significations. Thus we find
											<mentioned>take</mentioned> in the sense of <list
											type="ordered"><item n="1">"bewitch;" </item><item n="2"
												>"interrupt" ("You <emph>take</emph> him too
												quickly, Marcius," B. J. <emph>Poetast.</emph>);
												</item><item n="3">"consider" ("The whole court
												shall <emph>take</emph> itself abused," B. J.
												<emph>Cy.'s Rev.</emph> v. 1); </item><item n="4">
												"understand" ("You'll <emph>take</emph> him
												presently," <emph>E. out &amp;c.</emph> i. 1); and
												</item><item n="5"> "resort to" ("He was driven by
												foule weather to <emph>take</emph> a poor man's
												cottage," N. <emph>P.</emph> 597).</item></list>
										With prepositions the word has many more meanings.
											"<emph>Take</emph> out"="copy;" "<emph>take</emph>
										in"="subdue;" "<emph>take</emph> up"="borrow;"
											"<emph>take</emph> in with" (Bacon)="side with;"
											"<emph>take</emph> up"="pull up" of a horse. And these
										meanings are additional to the many other meanings which the
										word still retains. To enter further into the subject of the
										formation and meaning of words is not the purpose of this
										treatise. The glossaries of Nares and Halliwell supply the
										materials for a detailed study of the subject. One remark
										may be of use to the student before referring him to the
										following pages. The enumeration of the points of difference
										between Shakespearian and modern English may seem to have
										been a mere list of irregularities and proofs of the
										inferiority of the former to the latter. And it is true that
										the former period presents the English language in a
										transitional and undeveloped condition, rejecting and
										inventing much that the verdict of posterity has retained
										and discarded. it was an age of experiments, and the
										experiments were not always successful. While we have
										accepted <emph>copious, ingenious, disloyal,</emph> we have
										rejected as useless <emph>copy</emph> (in the sense <pb
											n="16"/>of "plenty"), <emph>ingin,</emph> and
											<emph>disnoble.</emph> But for freedom, for brevity and
										for vigour, Elizabethan is superior to modern English. Many
										of the words employed by Shakespeare and his contemporaries
										were the recent inventions of the age; hence they were used
										with a freshness and exactness to which we are
											strangers.<note resp="auth" anchored="yes">Exceptions
											are "eternal" used for "infernal" (<bibl

										Again, the spoken English so far predominated over the
										grammatical English that it materially influenced the rhythm
										of the verse (see Prosody), the construction of the
										sentence, and even sometimes (<ref target="par460"
											targOrder="U">460</ref>) the spelling of words. Hence
										sprung an artless and unlaboured harmony which seems the
										natural heritage of Elizabethan poets, whereas such harmony
										as is attained by modern authors frequently betrays a
										painful excess of art. Lastly, the use of some few still
										remaining inflections (the subjunctive in particular), the
										lingering <emph>sense</emph> of many other inflections that
										had passed away leaving behind something of the old
										versatility and audacity in the arrangement of the sentence,
										the stern subordination of grammar to terseness and
										clearness, and the consequent directness and naturalness of
										expression, all conspire to give a liveliness and
										wakefulness to Shakespearian English which are wanting in
										the grammatical monotony of the present day. We may perhaps
										claim some superiority in completeness and perspicuity for
										modern English, but if we were to appeal on this ground to
										the shade of Shakespeare in the words of Antonio in the
											<emph>Tempest,</emph>-- <quote>Do you not hear us
											speak?</quote> we might fairly be crushed with the reply
										of Sebastian-- <quote>I do; and surely It is a sleepy
											language.</quote></p></item></list>

						<p>The use of <hi rend="italics">all</hi>(<hi rend="italics">e</hi>) and <hi
								rend="italics">other</hi>(<hi rend="italics">e</hi>) as plural
							pronouns is consistent with ancient usage. It was as correct as "omnes"
							and "alii" in Latin, as "alle" and "andere" in German. Our modern "<hi
								rend="italics">others</hi> said" is only justified by a custom which
							might have compelled us to say "<hi rend="italics">manys</hi>" or "<hi
								rend="italics">alls</hi> said," and which has induced us to say "our
								better<hi rend="italics">s,</hi>" though not (with Heywood) "our
								bigger<hi rend="italics">s.</hi>" The plural use of <hi
								rend="italics">neither,</hi> "not both," depends on the plural use
							of <hi rend="italics">either</hi> for "both," which is still retained in
							"on <hi rend="italics">either</hi> side," used for "on both sides." This
							is justified by the original meaning of <hi rend="italics">ei-ther,</hi>
							i.e. "every one of two," just as <hi rend="italics">whe-ther</hi> means
							"which of two." "Either" in O.E. is found for "both." Similarly we say
								"<hi rend="italics">none were</hi> taken" instead of "<hi
								rend="italics">none</hi> (<hi rend="italics">no one</hi>) <hi
								rend="italics">was</hi> taken." We still retain the use of <hi
								rend="italics">other</hi> as a pronoun without <hi rend="italics"
								>the</hi> in such phrases as "they saw each <hi rend="italics"
								>other,</hi>" for "they saw each <hi rend="italics">the other.</hi>"
								<hi rend="italics">Many</hi> is also used as a noun. (See 5.) Hence
							we have: <cit><quote><l>In <mentioned>many's</mentioned>
									looks.</l></quote>
								<bibl n="shak. son"><title><abbr>Sonn.</abbr></title>

								rend="italics">many</hi>), there was also in Early English the noun
							"manie" or "meine" (multitude, from Fr. "maisgn&eacute;e," Lat. "minores
							natu"). But it is doubtful whether this influenced the use just

							the Folio "it selfe."</p>
						<p>There is a difficulty, however, in such a phrase as "I <hi rend="italics"
								>myself</hi> saw it." Why do we not find "I-self," "he-self," in
							such cases? Why, even in A.-S., do we find the rule that, when <hi
								rend="italics">self</hi> agrees with the <hi rend="italics"
								>subject</hi> of the sentence, the pronoun has to be repeated in the
								<hi rend="italics">dative</hi> before <hi rend="italics">self:</hi>
							"he (him) <hi rend="italics">self</hi> did it," but when the noun is in
							an oblique case <hi rend="italics">self</hi> is declined like any other
							adjective, and agrees with its noun: "he hine <hi rend="italics"
								>seolfne</hi> band," <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> "he bound
							himself?" The fact is, that in the second case "self" is an ordinary
							adjective used as an adjective: "he bound <hi rend="italics">the
								same</hi> or <hi rend="italics">aforesaid</hi> him." But in the
							former case "himself" is often an abridgment of a prepositional
							expression used as an adverb: "he did it by himself," "of himself," "for
							himself," and, being a quasi-adverb, does not receive the adjectival
								inflection.<note anchored="yes"><hi rend="italics">Myself</hi> seems
								used for our "by myself" in <cit><quote><l>I had as lief been
												<mentioned>myself</mentioned> alone.</l></quote>
									<bibl n="shak. ayl 3.2.269"><title><abbr>A. Y. L.</abbr></title>
										iii. 2. 269.</bibl></cit></note> It follows that "my,"
							"thy," in "myself" and "thyself," are not pronominal adjectives, but
							represent inflected cases of the pronouns. Thus "ourself" for
							"ourselves" is strictly in accordance with the A.-S. usage in
										<cit><quote><l>We will <mentioned>ourself</mentioned> in
										person to this war,</l></quote>
								<bibl n="shak. r2 1.4.42"><title><abbr>Rich. II.</abbr></title> i.
									4. 42.</bibl></cit> though of course Shakespeare only uses it
							for "myself" in the mouth of a dignified personage. Similarly in <hi
								rend="italics">Piers Plowman</hi> (B. viii. 62) we have "<hi
								rend="italics">myn</hi> one" (= "<hi rend="italics">of me</hi> one,"
								<hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> "<hi rend="italics">of me</hi> alone"
							[see <hi rend="bold">One</hi>]) used for "by myself," and "him one"
							(William of Palerne, 17) for "by himself;" and here "myn" is the
							genitive of "I," and "him" <pb n="30"/>the dative of "he," and "one" is
							an adjective. This is also illustrated by the Scottish "my lane," <hi
								rend="italics">i.e.</hi> "<hi rend="italics">my,</hi> or <hi
								rend="italics">by me,</hi> alone." Hence, instead of "ourselves" we
							have in Wickliffe, 2 <hi rend="italics">Cor.</hi> x. 2, "but we mesuren
							us in <hi rend="italics">us silf</hi> and comparisownen <hi
								rend="italics">us silf</hi> to us," and, a line above, "<hi
								rend="italics">hem silf</hi>" for "themselves."</p>
						<p>Very early, however, the notion became prevalent that the inflected
							pronoun was a pronominal adjective, and that "self" was a noun. Hence we
							find in Chaucer, "<hi rend="italics">myself hath</hi> been the whip,"
							"and to prove <hi rend="italics">their selfes</hi>" in Berners'
							Froissart; and in Shakespeare, <bibl n="shak. tmp 1.2.132"
									><title>Temp.</title> i. 2. 132</bibl>, "thy crying <hi
								rend="italics">self.</hi>" Hence the modern "ourselves,"
							"yourselves."</p>
						<p>The use of "self" as a noun is common in Shakespeare: "Tarquin's self,"
								<bibl n="shak. cor 2.2.98"><title>Coriol.</title> ii. 2. 98</bibl>;
							"my woeful <hi rend="italics">self,</hi>" <hi rend="italics">L. C.</hi>
							143. Hence the reading of the Folio may be correct in the first of the
							following lines: <cit><quote><l>Even so <hi rend="italics">myself
											bewails</hi> good Gloucester's case,</l>
									<l> With sad unhelpful tears and with dimm'd eyes</l>
									<l>
										<hi rend="italics">Look</hi> after him.</l></quote>
								<bibl n="shak. 2h6 3.1.217"><title><abbr>2 Hen. VI.</abbr></title>
									iii. 1. 217.</bibl></cit> But the change to the first person is
							more in accordance with Shakespeare's-usage, as: <cit><quote><l>This
										love of theirs <mentioned>myself have</mentioned> often
										seen.</l></quote>
								<bibl n="shak. tgv 3.1.23"><title><abbr>T. G. of V.</abbr></title>

							is sometimes changed into <hi rend="italics">on</hi> or <hi
								rend="italics">an.</hi> See <hi rend="bold">On,</hi> 182. And indeed
							the prefixes <hi rend="italics">an-, on-, of-, a-,</hi> were all nearly

								>a</hi>fingred," but also "<hi rend="italics">an-</hi>hungered," as
							in <hi rend="italics">St. Matthew</hi> xxv. 44, A. V.: "When saw we thee
								<hi rend="italics">an</hi> hungered <pb n="35"/>or <hi

								<bibl n="shak. per 3.2.17"><title><abbr>P. of T.</abbr></title> iii.
									2. 17.</bibl></cit></p>
						<p>(1) In the first passage <hi rend="italics">all-to</hi> is probably an
							intensive form of "<hi rend="italics">to,</hi>" which in Early English
							(see <hi rend="bold">Too,</hi> below) had of itself an intensive
							meaning. Originally "to" belonged to the verb. Thus "to-breke" meant
							"break in pieces." When "all" was added, as in "all to-breke," it at
							first had no connection with "to," but intensified "to-breke." But "to"
							and "too" are written indifferently for one another by Elizabethan and
							earlier writers, and hence sprang a corrupt use of "all-to," caused
							probably by the frequent connection of <hi rend="italics">all</hi> and
								<hi rend="italics">too</hi> illustrated above. It means here
							"altogether."</p>
						<p>(2) In the second passage some (<hi rend="italics">a</hi>) connect
							"to-topple," believing that here and in <bibl n="shak. wiv 4.4.57"
									><title>M. W. of W.</title> iv. 4. 57</bibl>, "to-pinch," "to"
							is an intensive prefix, as in Early English. But neither of the two
							passages necessitates the supposition that Shakespeare used this
							archaism. (See <hi rend="italics">M. W. of W.</hi> iv. 4. 5 below, <hi
								rend="bold">To omitted and inserted,</hi> 350.) We can, therefore,
							either (<hi rend="italics">b</hi>) write "all-to" (as in the Globe), and
							treat it as meaning "altogether," or (<hi rend="italics">c</hi>) suppose
							that "all" means "quite," and that "to topple," like "to rend," depends
							upon "seem." This last is the more obvious and probable
								construction.<note anchored="yes">Or, adopting this construction, we
								may take <hi rend="italics">all</hi> to mean "the whole house." "The
								principals did seem to rend, and the whole house to topple."</note>
							<pb n="38"/></p>
						<p>From this use of "all too" or "all to," closely connected in the sense of
							"altogether," it was corruptly employed as an intensive prefix, more
							especially before verbs beginning with <hi rend="italics">be-:</hi> "<hi
								rend="italics">all-to-be</hi>qualify," B. J.; "<hi rend="italics"
								>all-to-be</hi>kist," <hi rend="italics">ib.;</hi> and later, "he
								<hi rend="italics">all-to be-</hi> Gullivers me," <hi
								rend="smallcaps">SWIFT;</hi> "<hi rend="italics"
							>all-to-be-</hi>traytor'd," <hi rend="smallcaps">NARES.</hi></p>

						<p>It was natural for the Elizabethans to dislike putting the qualifying

						<p>There is probably here a confusion of two constructions, (1) "And though
							time creep so slow as it never crept before," and (2) "And though time
							never crept so slow as in the case I am supposing." These two are
							combined into, "And though time creep--(how shall I describe it? though
							it crept) never so slow." Construction (2) is illustrated by
											<cit><quote><l><hi rend="italics">Never so</hi> weary,
											<hi rend="italics">never so</hi> in woe,</l>
									<l> I can no further crawl, no further go.</l></quote>

						<p>Here, strictly speaking, the ellipsis is "<hi rend="italics">I have
								been,</hi>" or "having been;" "I <hi rend="italics">have never</hi>
							been <hi rend="italics">so</hi> weary." But it is easy to see that
							"never so weary" being habitually used in this sense, Hermia might say,
							"I <hi rend="italics">am</hi> never-so-weary," or still more easily,
							"though I were <hi rend="italics">never-so-weary.</hi>"</p>
						<p>In such phrases as "<hi rend="italics">never</hi> the nearer," <hi
								rend="italics">never</hi> seems to mean "nought." So Wickliffe, <hi

								<bibl n="shak. tn 3.4.261"><title><abbr>T. N.</abbr></title> iii. 4.
									261.</bibl></cit> For we could not say "there can be <hi
								rend="italics">none</hi> satisfaction." This emphatic use of the
							pronoun at the end of a sentence is found very early. <hi rend="italics"
								>None</hi> seems loosely used for "not at all," like "nothing" (55),
							"no-whit," <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> "not." And this may, perhaps,
							explain: <cit><quote><l><hi rend="italics">None</hi> a stranger
										there</l>

								<bibl n="shak. cym 1.6.59"><title><abbr>Cymb.</abbr></title> i. 6.
									59.</bibl></cit> Here either <hi rend="italics">none</hi> means
							"not," "ne'er," or a comma must be placed after <hi rend="italics"
								>none:</hi> "<hi rend="italics">none,</hi> being a stranger," which
							is a very harsh construction.</p>
						<p>The adverbial use of "none" may be traced to Early English and
							Anglo-Saxon. Under the form "nan," <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> "ne-an"
							(compare <pb n="46"/>German "nein"), we find "nan more," and also "<hi
								rend="italics">none</hi> longer," "whether he wolde or <hi
								rend="italics">noon</hi>" (<hi rend="smallcaps">CHAUCER,</hi>
							M&auml;tzner). "Nan" was used as an adverbial accusative for "by no
							means" even in A.-S. (M&auml;tzner, iii. 131.) In <hi rend="italics"
								>Rich. II.</hi> v. 2. 99, "He shall be <hi rend="italics"
							>none,</hi>" the meaning is, "he shall not be one of their number."
							"None" is still used by us for "nothing," followed by a partitive
							genitive, "I had <hi rend="italics">none</hi> of it;" and this explains
							the Elizabethan phrase <cit><quote><l>She will
											<mentioned>none</mentioned> of me.</l></quote>

							&amp;c., where the adjective appears merely to be emphasized, and not
							used adverbially. In the later text the adjective is placed, here and in
							other passages, in its ordinary position. The adjectives "each," "such,"
							"which," (used for "of what kind,") and "many" were especially often
							thus used. "At <hi rend="italics">ich a</hi> mel" = "at each meal," <hi
								rend="italics">Piers Plough. Crede.</hi> 109. (So in Scotch "ilk<hi

						<p>The last-quoted passages render untenable the theory (Archbishop Trench,
								<hi rend="italics">English Past and Present</hi>) which explains
							"many <hi rend="italics">a</hi> man" as a corruption of "many of men."
							In these passages, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> "moni <hi rend="bold"
									><hi rend="italics">anes</hi></hi> cunnes" ("of many a race"),
							the article or numeral <pb n="61"/>adjective "an" is declined like an
							adjective, while "moni" is not. The inference is, that "moni" is used
							adverbially. In the same way the Germans say "mancher (adj.) mann," but
							"manch (adv.) <hi rend="italics">ein</hi> mann," "<hi rend="italics"
								>ein</hi> solcher (adj.) mann," but "solch (adv.) <hi rend="italics"
								>ein</hi> mann." In A.-S. the idiom was "many man," not "many a
							man." The termination in <hi rend="italics">y,</hi> causing "many" to be
							considered as adverbially used, may not perhaps account for the
							introduction of the <hi rend="italics">a</hi> into E. E., but it may
							account for its retention in Elizabethan and modern English. Nor can it
							escape notice that most of the adjectives which take <hi rend="italics"
								>a</hi> after them end in <hi rend="italics">ch,</hi> or <hi
								rend="italics">lic</hi> ("like"), an adverbial termination. So
							beside the adjectives enumerated above, "thellich" (modern Dorsetshire,
							"thilk" or "thick"), "the like," answering to "whilk" ("which"), is
							followed by <hi rend="italics">a.</hi> So after the adverb "ofte," we
							have "a day" in <cit><quote>Ful <mentioned>ofte</mentioned> a day he
									swelde and seyde alas!</quote>
								<bibl><author>CHAUCER,</author>
									<title><title><abbr>Knighte's Tale,</abbr></title></title>

						<p>Nor can it be denied that in E. E. "of" is often omitted in such phrases
							as "many manner (of) men," "a pair (of) gloves," &amp;c. just as in
							German we have "diese Art Mensch." But we also say "<hi rend="italics"
								>a</hi> few men" (an expression that occurs as early as Robert of
							Brunne), and "few" seems to have been an adjective.</p>
						<p>It is probable that both the constructions above-mentioned are required
							to explain this use of <hi rend="italics">a.</hi> Thus "<hi
								rend="italics">a</hi> hundred men" is for "<hi rend="italics">a</hi>
							hundred (of) men," but in "<hi rend="italics">a</hi> twelvemonth," "<hi
								rend="italics">a</hi> fortnight," "twelve" and "fourteen" are not

						<p>The question naturally arises, are these verbals, "locking," &amp;c.
							nouns? and, if so, why are they not followed by "of,"--<hi
								rend="italics">e.g.</hi> "the locking <hi rend="italics">of</hi> the
							spirits"? Or are they parts of verbs? and in that case, why are they
							preceded by the article? The fact that a verb in E. E. had an abstract
							noun in <hi rend="italics">-ing</hi> (A.-S. <hi rend="italics"
								>-ung</hi>)--<hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> "slaeten," to hunt;
							"slaeting," hunting--renders it <hi rend="italics">a priori</hi>
							probable that these words in <hi rend="italics">-ing</hi> are nouns.
							Very early, however, the termination <hi rend="italics">-ng</hi> was
							confused with, and finally supplanted, the present participle
							termination in <hi rend="italics">-nde.</hi> Thus in the earlier text of
							Layamon (iii. 72) we have "heo riden <hi rend="italics">singinge,</hi>"
								<hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> "they rode <hi rend="italics"
								>singing;</hi>" and in the later text the proper participial form
								"<hi rend="italics">singende.</hi>" An additional element of
							confusion was introduced by the gerundial inflection <hi rend="italics"
								>enne, e.g.</hi> "singenne," used after the preposition "to." As
							early as the twelfth century "to singenne" (Morris, <hi rend="italics"
								>E. E. Specimens,</hi> p. 53) became "to singende," and hence (by
							the corruption above mentioned) "to singinge." Hence, when Layamon
							writes that the king went out "an-slaeting" (ii. 88), or "a-slatinge"
							(iii. 168), it is not easy to prove that the verbal <hi rend="italics"
								>noun</hi> is here used: for the form may represent the corruption
							of the gerund used with the preposition "an" instead of with "to." And
							as early as Layamon we find the infinitive "to kumen" side by side with
							the present participle "to comende" (i. 49); and the gerund "cumene"
							side by side with the verbal "coming" (iii. 231); and the noun
							"tiding(s)" spelt in the earlier text "tidind" or "tidinde," the present
							participle (i. 59). The conclusion is, that although "locking" is a
							noun, and therefore preceded by "the," yet it is so far confused with
							the gerund as to be allowed the privilege of governing a direct object.
							The "of" was omitted partly for shortness, as well as owing to the
							confusion above mentioned.</p>

								<bibl n="shak. tn 5.1.141"><title><abbr>T. N.</abbr></title> v. 1.
									141.</bibl></cit> down to our modern (3) "for tainting my love."
							And hence the E. E. (William of Palerne, edit. Skeat), "for drede of
							descuverynge <hi rend="italics">of</hi> that was do," l. 1024, "of
							kastyng <hi rend="italics">of</hi> lokes," l. 942, are abbreviated in
							modern English into "disclosing that which was done" and "casting
							looks." This abbreviation is also remarkably illustrated by Bacon in his
							third Essay. He first uses the abbreviated form, and then, with a verbal
							noun that could not so easily have a verbal force, he adopts the full
							form: "Concerning the Means of <hi rend="italics">procuring Unity.</hi>
							Men must beware that in <hi rend="italics">the Procuring or Muniting of
								Religious Unity,</hi> they do not dissolve and deface the Laws of
							Charity." It is perhaps this feeling that the verbal was an ordinary
							noun, which allows Shakespeare to make an adjective qualify it even
							though <hi rend="italics">of</hi> is omitted after it. <cit><quote><l>He

						<head>CONJUNCTIONS. <hi rend="italic">But,</hi> transition of meaning</head>
						<p>But. Transition of meaning. These last passages illustrate the transition
							of <hi rend="italics">but</hi> from <hi rend="italics">except</hi> to
							"on the contrary," <pb n="83"/>"by way of prevention." The transition is
							natural, inasmuch as an <hi rend="italics">exception</hi> may well be
							called <hi rend="italics">contrary</hi> to the rule. The first passage
							is a blending of two constructions: "<hi rend="italics">if</hi> she <hi
								rend="italics">had not spoken</hi> it dying I would not believe,"
							and "I would not believe, <hi rend="italics">but</hi> she spoke it
							dying." Similarly: "<hi rend="italics">Except</hi> infirmity <hi
								rend="italics">had</hi> seized--he had (would have) measured," and
							"He had (would have) measured, <hi rend="italics">but</hi> (by way of
							prevention) infirmity <hi rend="italics">hath</hi> seized."</p>
						<p>The different usages of <hi rend="italics">but</hi> arise, (1) from its
							variations between the meaning of "except," "unless," and the
							adversative meaning "on the other hand;" (2) from the fact that the
							negative before <hi rend="italics">but,</hi> in the sense of "except,"
							is sometimes omitted and at other times inserted. Thus "<hi
								rend="italics">but</hi> ten came" may mean "ten <hi rend="italics"
								>however</hi> came," or "(none) <hi rend="italics">but</hi> ten,
							i.e. <hi rend="italics">only</hi> ten, came." <hi rend="italics"
								>But</hi> is now much more confined than it was, to its adversative
							meaning. We still say "it never rains <hi rend="italics">but</hi> it
							pours" (where the subject is the same before and after but); and, even
							where a new subject is introduced, we might say, "I did not know <hi
								rend="italics">but</hi> you had come," "You shall not persuade me
								<hi rend="italics">but</hi> you knew," &amp;c.; but this use is
							colloquial, and limited to a few common verbs. We should scarcely write

						<p>There is, perhaps, a disposition to revert to the old idiom in which the
							two particles were similar: "other . . . other." (The contraction of
							"other" into "or" is illustrated by "whe'r" for "whether" in O.E. and
							the Elizabethan dramatists.) Perhaps, also, additional emphasis is
							sought by combining two particles. We find "<hi rend="italics">whether .

					<head>PREPOSITIONS.</head>
					<div3 id="par138" type="paragraph" n="138">
						<head>PREPOSITIONS. Local and metaphorical meaning</head>
						<p>Prepositions primarily represent local relations; secondarily and
							metaphorically, agency, cause, &amp;c. A preposition (as <hi
								rend="italics">after,</hi> see below) may be used metaphorically in
							one age and literally in the next, or <hi rend="italics">vice
								vers&acirc;.</hi> This gives rise to many changes in the meaning of
							prepositions.</p>
						<p>The shades of different meaning which suggest the use of different
							prepositions are sometimes almost indistinguishable.</p>
						<p>We say, "a canal is full <hi rend="italics">of</hi> water." There is no
							reason why we should not also say "full <hi rend="italics">with</hi>
							water," as a garden is "fair <hi rend="italics">with</hi> flowers."
							Again, "a canal is filled <hi rend="italics">with</hi> water," the verb
							in modern English preferring <hi rend="italics">with</hi> to signify
							instrumentality, but "filled <hi rend="italics">of</hi> water" is
							conceivable; and, as a matter of fact, Shakespeare does write "furnished
								<hi rend="italics">of,</hi> provided <hi rend="italics">of,</hi>
							supplied <hi rend="italics">of,</hi>" for <hi rend="italics">with.</hi>
							Lastly the water may be regarded as an agent, and then we say, "the
							canal is filled <hi rend="italics">by</hi> the water." But an action may
							be regarded as "<hi rend="italics">of</hi>" the agent, as well as "<hi
								rend="italics">by</hi>" the agent, and "<hi rend="italics">of</hi>"
							is frequently thus used in the A. V. of the Bible and in Elizabethan
							authors, as well as <pb n="94"/>in E. E. For these reasons the use of
							prepositions, depending upon the fashion of metaphor in different ages,
							is very variable. It would be hard to explain why we still say, "I live
								<hi rend="italics">on</hi> bread," but not "Or have we eaten <hi
								rend="italics">on</hi> the insane root?" (<hi rend="italics"
								>Macb.</hi> i. 3. 84); as hard as to explain why we talk of a "high"
							price or rate, while Beaumont and Fletcher speak of a "deeper rate."</p>

					<div3 id="par139" type="paragraph" n="139">
						<head>PREPOSITIONS. more restricted in meaning now than in Elizabethan
							authors</head>
						<p>Prepositions: modern tendency to restrict their meaning.</p>
						<p>One general rule may be laid down, that the meanings of the prepositions
							are more restricted now than in the Elizabethan authors: partly because
							some of the prepositions have been pressed into the ranks of the
							conjunctions, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> "for," "but," "after;" partly
							because, as the language has developed, new prepositional ideas having
							sprung up and requiring new prepositional words to express them, the
							number of prepositions has increased, while the scope of each has
							decreased. Thus many of the meanings of "by" have been divided among
							"near," "in accordance with," "by reason of," "owing to;" "but" has
							divided some of its provinces among "unless," "except;" "for" has been
							in many cases supplanted by "because of," "as regards;" "in" by
							"during."</p>

						<p>For to, which is now never joined with the infinitive except by a

						<p>It is probable, as the last example suggests, that these verbals are
							nouns after which "of" is sometimes expressed. Hence "<hi rend="italics"
								>in</hi> sleeping" may simply be another form of "a-sleeping." But
							the <hi rend="italics">in</hi> brings out, more strongly than the <hi
								rend="italics">a-,</hi> the time <hi rend="italics">in</hi> which,
							or <hi rend="italics">while,</hi> the action is being performed. It is
							also probable that the influence of the French idiom, "<hi
								rend="italics">en disant</hi> ces mots," tended to mislead English
							authors into the belief that <hi rend="italics">in</hi> was superfluous,
							and that the verbals thus used were present participles. (See also 93.)

						<p>The <hi rend="italics">of</hi> after "to like" is perhaps a result of the

							seem to disqualify the verb from taking a direct object. Similarly "it

						<p>If it be asked why "the" is not inserted before the verbal,--<hi

						<p>To, in the phrase "I would <hi rend="italics">to</hi> God," may mean
							"near," "in the sight of;" or there may be a meaning of motion: "I

							which is more common in our version of the Bible than "I would." The <hi

						<p>This theory is rendered the more probable because, as a rule, in

							when the noun is qualified by an adjective, but not otherwise. Thus we
							can use "yester-day," "last night," "this week," adverbially, but not
							"day," "night," "week," because in the latter words there is nothing to
							indicate <hi rend="italics">how</hi> time is regarded. In O. E. the
							inflections were sufficient to justify an adverbial use, "day<hi
								rend="italics">es,</hi>" "night<hi rend="italics">es.</hi>" (Compare

						<p>Prepositions transposed. "It stands me upon." This phrase cannot be
							explained, though it is influenced, by the custom of transposition.
							Almost inextricable confusion seems to have been made by the Elizabethan
							authors between two distinct idioms: (1) "it stands on" (adv.), or "at
							hand," or "upon" (comp. "instat," <foreign lang="greek"
								>prosh/kei</foreign>), <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> "it is of

								>in-sist</hi> upon."</p>
						<p>In (1) the full phrase would be, "it stands on, upon, to me," but, <hi
								rend="italics">owing to the fact that</hi> "<hi rend="italics">to
								me</hi>" <hi rend="italics">or</hi> "<hi rend="italics">me</hi>"

								sentence,</hi> the words were transposed into "it stands me <hi
								rend="italics">upon.</hi>" "Me" was thus naturally mistaken for the
							object of <hi rend="italics">upon.</hi></p>
						<p>Hence we have not only the correct form-- <cit><quote><l>It stands <hi

						<p>The fact that this use of <hi rend="italics">upon</hi> in "stand <hi

							more a necessary part of this separate inflection than it is of "his,"
							the third pers. sing. indic. pres. of "beon" ("be"). "His" is constantly
							found for "is" in Layamon. No doubt the coincidence in sound between the
							inflection <hi rend="italics">'s</hi> and the possessive "his" made the

						<p>Thou and You.<note anchored="yes">The Elizabethan distinction between <hi

								remarkably illustrated by the usage in E. E., as detailed by Mr.
								Skeat in <hi rend="italics">William of Palerne,</hi> Preface, p.
								xli.</note>
							<hi rend="italics">Thou</hi> in Shakespeare's time was, very much like
							"du" now among the Germans, the pronoun of (1) <pb n="154"/>affection
							towards friends (2) good-humoured superiority to servants, and (3)
							contempt or anger to strangers. It had, however, already fallen somewhat
							into disuse, and, being regarded as archaic, was naturally adopted (4)
							in the higher poetic style and in the language of solemn prayer.</p>
						<p>(1) This is so common as to need no examples. It should be remarked,
							however, that this use is modified sometimes by euphony (the ponderous
								<hi rend="italics">thou, art,</hi> and terminations in <hi
								rend="italics">est</hi> being avoided) and sometimes by fluctuations
							of feeling. Thus in the <hi rend="italics">T. G. of V.</hi> Valentine
							and Proteus in the first twenty lines of earnest dialogue use nothing
							but <hi rend="italics">thou.</hi> But as soon as they begin to jest,
							"thou art" is found too seriously ponderous, and we have (i. 1. 25) "<hi
								rend="italics">you</hi> are over boots in love," while the lighter
								<hi rend="italics">thee</hi> is not discarded in (i. 1. 28) "it
							boots <hi rend="italics">thee</hi> not." So in the word-fencing of lines
							36-40, <hi rend="italics">you</hi> and <hi rend="italics">your</hi> are
							preferred, but an affectionate farewell brings them back again to <hi
								rend="italics">thou.</hi> The last line presents an apparent
							difficulty: <cit><quote><l><hi rend="italics">Proteus.</hi> All
										happiness bechance to thee in Milan!</l>
									<l>
										<hi rend="italics">Valentine.</hi> As much to <hi

						<p>But while <hi rend="italics">thee</hi> applies to the single traveller,
								<hi rend="italics">you</hi> is better <hi rend="italics">suited</hi>
							to <hi rend="italics">Proteus and his friends</hi> at home. It may be
							added, that when the friends meet after their long parting, there is a
							certain coldness in the frequent <hi rend="italics">you.</hi> (<bibl

							Thus in the dialogue between Henry IV. and the Prince (<hi

								rend="italics">you?</hi>" is perhaps the only exception to the rule.
							So in the dialogue between Talbot and his son (<hi rend="italics">1 Hen.

								(<bibl n="shak. 1h6 4.6.6"><title>1 Hen. VI.</title> iv. 6.

								ii. 3. 43</bibl>-67, and in the familiar "I'll break <hi
								rend="italics">thy</hi> little finger, Harry," <hi rend="italics"
								>ib.</hi> 90, she uses <hi rend="italics">thou</hi> throughout.</p>
						<p>In the high Roman style, Brutus and Portia use <hi rend="italics"
								>you.</hi></p>
						<p>Hotspur generally uses <hi rend="italics">thou</hi> to his wife, but,

						<p>The last two examples may also be explained (see 340) by the northern

							and the examples in (1) might come under the cases of plural nominative
							with apparently singular inflection considered in 333. But taking all
							the examples of (1) and (2) we are, I think, justified in saying that
							the relative was often regarded like a noun by nature third person
							singular, and, therefore, uninfluenced by the antecedent.</p>
						<p>On the other hand, the verb is irregularly attracted into the second

						<p>Relative with Supplementary Pronoun. With the Germans it is still
							customary, when the antecedent is a pronoun of the first or second
							person, to repeat the pronoun for the sake of defining the person,
							because the relative is regarded as being in the third person. Thus
							"Thou <hi rend="italics">who thou</hi> hearest," &amp;c. The same

						<p>In the same way in Elizabethan authors, when the interrogative <hi

						<p>Here <hi rend="italics">which</hi> means "as regards <hi rend="italics"
								>which,</hi>" and in this and in other places it approximates to
							that vulgar idiom which is well known to readers of "Martin Chuzzlewit."
							(See 272.)</p>
						<p>The following seems at first as though it could be explained thus; but
							"who" is put for "whom" (see 274), and "exact the penalty" is regarded
							as a transitive verb: <pb n="171"/><cit><quote><l><hi rend="italics"
											>Who,</hi> if <hi rend="italics">he</hi> break, thou

						<p>Or this may be an imitation of the Latin idiom which puts the relative
							before the conjunction, thus: <cit><quote><l><hi rend="italics"
											>Who,</hi> when <hi rend="italics">they</hi> were in
										health, I tell thee, herald,</l>
									<l> I thought upon one pair of English legs</l>

							and <hi rend="italics">that</hi> was re-established in its ancient
							supremacy. Addison, in his "Humble Petition of Who and Which," allows
							the petitioners to say: "We are descended of ancient families, and kept
							up our dignity and honour many years, till the jack-sprat <hi
								rend="italics">That</hi> supplanted us." But the supplanting was a
							restoration of an incapable but legitimate monarch, rather than a
							usurpation. Since the time of Addison a reaction has taken place; the
							convenience of the three distinct forms has been recognized, and we have
							returned somewhat to the Elizabethan usage.</p>

								rend="italics">i.e.</hi> "for this purpose that," "after p<hi
								rend="italics">am</hi> pe," &amp;c. Here "pam" is more emphatic than
							"pe," and evidently gave rise to the English <hi rend="italics"
								>that.</hi> But "pam" was the A.-S. demonstrative. It follows that
							the <hi rend="italics">that</hi> is (by derivative use, at all events)
							demonstrative in "for <hi rend="italics">that,</hi>" or, perhaps we
							should say, stands as an abridgment for "<hi rend="italics">that</hi>
							(demonst.) <hi rend="italics">that</hi> (rel.)." In fact, we can trace
							the A.-S. "after p<hi rend="italics">am</hi> pe" to the E. E. "after <hi
								rend="italics">that</hi> that," and so to the later "after <hi

								<bibl n="shak. mac 4.3.185"><title><abbr>Macb.</abbr></title> iv. 3.
									185.</bibl></cit> as "for <hi rend="italics">that</hi> (that),
								<hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> for <hi rend="italics">that,</hi>
							because, I saw." It would be wrong, however, to say that <hi
								rend="italics">that</hi> in "since <hi rend="italics">that</hi>" is,
							by derivative use, demonstrative. On the contrary, "since" in itself
							(sip-pan) contains the demonstrative, and "since <hi rend="italics"
								>that</hi>" corresponds to "sip-pan p<hi rend="italics">at</hi>"
							where <hi rend="italics">that</hi> (pat) is relative. And similarly
							"though <hi rend="italics">that</hi>" corresponds to the A.-S. "peah
							pe," where <hi rend="italics">that</hi> (pe) is the relative. The <hi
								rend="italics">that</hi> in <pb n="198"/>"<hi rend="italics">after
								that,</hi>" "<hi rend="italics">before that,</hi>" invites
							comparison with the "quam" in "postquam" and "antequam," though in the
							Latin it is the antecedent, not the relative, that is suppressed. The
							tendency of the relative to assume a conjunctional meaning is
							illustrated by the post-classical phrase, "dico <hi rend="italics"
								>quod</hi> (or <hi rend="italics">quia</hi>) verum est," in the
							place of the classical "dico id verum esse." Many of the above
							Elizabethan phrases, which are now disused, may be illustrated from
							French: "<hi rend="italics">Since that,</hi>" "puisque;" "<hi
								rend="italics">though that,</hi>" "quoi que;" "<hi rend="italics"
								>before that,</hi>" "avant que," &amp;c. Instead of "<hi
								rend="italics">for that,</hi>" we find in French the full form, "par
							ce que," <hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> "by <hi rend="italics">that</hi>
							(dem.) <hi rend="italics">that</hi> (rel.)." It is probable that Chaucer
							and Mandeville, if not earlier writers, were influenced in their use of
							the conjunctional <hi rend="italics">that</hi> by French usage. Even in
							the phrase "I say <hi rend="italics">that</hi> it is true," <hi
								rend="italics">that</hi> may be explained as having a relatival
							force (like <foreign lang="greek">o(/ti,</foreign> "quod," and the
							French "que"), meaning, "I say <hi rend="italics">in what way, how
								that,</hi> it is true." In the phrase, "I come <hi rend="italics"
								>that</hi> (<hi rend="italics">in the way in which;</hi> 'ut,'
								<foreign lang="greek">w(s,</foreign> 'afin que') I may see," the
							relatival force of <hi rend="italics">that</hi> is still more

							supplemented by a negative adverb "nawicht," "nawt," "noht" (which are
							all different forms of "no whit" or "naught"), coming after the verb.

						<p>Possibly the idiom now under consideration is also a result of the Early
							English idiom. The <hi rend="italics">not,</hi> which had ousted the old
							dual negative "ne" . . . "not," may have been thought entitled to a
							place either before or after the verb. Latin, moreover, would tend in
							the same direction. It must further be remembered that <hi
								rend="italics">not</hi> is now less emphatic than it was, when it
							retained the meaning of "naught" or "no-whit." We can say, "I <hi
								rend="italics">in-no-way</hi> trust you," or, perhaps, even "I <hi
								rend="italics">no-whit</hi> trust you," but <hi rend="italics"
								>not</hi> is too unemphatic to allow us to say "I <hi rend="italics"
								>not</hi> trust you." Hence the "do" is now necessary to receive a
							part of the emphasis.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italics">Not</hi> is sometimes found in E. E. and A.-S. between

						<p>May used for the old subjunctive in the sense of purpose.</p>
						<p>If we compare Wickliffe's with the sixteenth-century Versions of the New

						<p>In 1 <hi rend="italics">Cor.</hi> iv. 8, Wickliffe has, "And I wold that

							the later Versions, "And I would to God that ye did reign, that we also
								<hi rend="italics">might reign.</hi>" So also <hi rend="italics"
								>Col.</hi> i. 28: "Techynge eche man in al wisdom; that we <hi

							does not occur, while "sung" is common as a past indicative. "Sprang" is
							less common as a past tense than "sprung" (2 <hi rend="italics">Hen.
								IV.</hi> i. 1. 111). "Begun" (<hi rend="italics">Hamlet,</hi> iii.
							2. 220) is not uncommon for "began," which is also used. We also find
										<cit><quote><l>I <mentioned>drunk</mentioned> him to his
										bed.</l></quote>

						<p>Past indicative tenses in <hi rend="italics">u</hi> were common in the
							seventeenth century, but the irregularity dates from the regular Early
							English idiom. <pb n="242"/></p>
						<p>In A. -S. the second person singular, and the three plural persons of
							some verbs, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> "singan," had the same vowel
								<hi rend="italics">u,</hi> while the first and third persons
							singular had <hi rend="italics">a.</hi> Hence, though the distinction
							was observed pretty regularly in E. E., yet gradually the <hi
								rend="italics">u</hi> and <hi rend="italics">a</hi> were used
							indiscriminately in the past tense without distinction of person.</p>

							>y-</hi></head>
						<p>The participial prefix y- is only two or three times used in
							Shakespeare's plays: "y-clept," "y-clad," "y-slaked." In E. E. <hi
								rend="italics">y-</hi> is prefixed to other forms of speech beside
							participles, like the German <hi rend="italics">ge-.</hi> But in
							Elizabethan English the <hi rend="italics">y-</hi> was wholly disused
							except as a participial prefix, and even the latter was archaic. Hence
							we must explain as follows: <cit><quote><l>The sum of this</l>

									round.</l></quote>

									Gower, 35.</bibl></cit></p>
						<p>Shakespeare was probably going to write (as in the same speech, line 1,
								"<hi rend="italics">yslaked</hi> hath") "<hi rend="italics"
								>yravished</hi> the regions hath," but the necessity of the rhyme,
							and the diminished sense of the grammatical force of the participial
							prefix, made him alter the construction. <pb n="246"/>The <hi
								rend="italics">y-</hi> is used by Sackville before a present
							participle, "<hi rend="italics">y-</hi>causing." In <bibl
								n="shak. mv 2.9.68"><title>M. of V.</title> ii. 9. 68</bibl>, and
							elsewhere, we find "I wiss" apparently for the old "y-wiss."</p>

						<p>This is in accordance with the Latin idiom, "jampridem opto," &amp;c.,
							and it is explicable on the ground that, when an action continued up to
							the present time is still continuing, the speaker may prefer the verb to
							dwell <hi rend="italics">simply</hi> on the fact that the action is

						<p>It will be noticed that the above examples all contain a negative. The

						<p>The simple present is in the following example incorrectly combined with

							seynge dumb men spekynge and crokid men goynge, blynde men seyinge,"
							Tyndale (1534) has "The people wondred to se the domme speak, the maymed
							whole, the halt <hi rend="italics">to</hi> go, and the blynde <hi
								rend="italics">to</hi> se;" and the A. V. (1611) has <hi
								rend="italics">to</hi> throughout. This idiom is also very common in
							North, and Florio's "Montaigne." We have recurred to the idiom of Early
							English.</p>
						<p>Compare William of Palerne, l. 871: "and whan he sei&lt;*&gt; bat semly
								<hi rend="italics">sitte</hi> him bi-fore," <hi rend="italics"
								>i.e.</hi> "and when he saw her in her beauty <hi rend="italics"
								>sit</hi> before him." In this quotation we might render "sitte" by
							the participle "sitting," as the girl is regarded as "in the state of
							sitting." This opens the question of the origin of the phrase "to see
							great Hercules <hi rend="italics">whipping.</hi>" Is "whipping," by
							derivation, a verbal abbreviated for "a-whipping." as in 93, or a
							present participle? The common construction after "see" and "hear" in
							Layamon and William of Palerne seems to be neither the participle nor
							the verbal, but the infinitive in <hi rend="italics">-e</hi> or <hi
								rend="italics">-en.</hi> Probably, when the infinitive inflection
							died out, it was felt that the short uninflected form was not weighty
							enough to express the emphatic infinitive, and recourse was had to the
							present participle, a substitution which was aided by the similarity of
							the terminations <hi rend="italics">-en</hi> and <hi rend="italics"
								>-ing.</hi> This is one of the many cases in which the terminations
							of the infinitive and present participle have been confused together
							(93), and the <hi rend="italics">-ing</hi> in this construction
							represents the old infinitive inflection <hi rend="italics">-en.</hi>
							This may explain: <cit><quote><l>I my brother know</l>
									<l> Yet <hi rend="italics">living</hi> (to live) in my

							<hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi> "that my brother lives."</p>
						<p>Hence, perhaps, also <hi rend="italics">-ing</hi> was added as a

								>-ene,</hi> in such expressions as <cit><quote><l>Put the liveries

						<p>The reader of Shakespeare should always be ready to recognize the

						<p>Here, in the second line, "tire," necessarily subjunctive, impresses upon

							take "fight," &amp;c. as indicative, and ruin the passage.</p>
						<p>This optative or imperative use of the subjunctive, though common in
							Elizabethan writers, had already begun to be supplanted by auxiliaries.
							Thus Wickliffe has (<hi rend="italics">Coloss.</hi> ii. 16) "No man <hi

							which of themselves are sometimes sufficient to indicate the person of
							the pronoun understood, as in Milton-- <quote rend="blockquote">Thou art
								my son beloved: in him <hi rend="italics">am</hi> pleased;</quote>

								rend="italics">is</hi> a book <hi rend="italics">worthy</hi> to
							read;" but, "this book <hi rend="italics">is</hi> to read and not to
							tear," means "this book <hi rend="italics">is intended</hi> or made for
							the purpose of reading." This distinction was not recognized by the
							Elizabethans. When we wish to express "worthy" elliptically, we insert
								<hi rend="italics">a:</hi> "He <hi rend="italics">is a</hi> man to
							respect," or we use the passive, and say, "He <hi rend="italics">is</hi>
							to be respected." Shakespeare could have written "He <hi rend="italics"

							in many cases where we should use the passive. Thus--

						<p>(1) In legal expressions in which French influence can be traced:

						<p>The "three" is emphatic, and the divorcing of <hi rend="italics"
								>some</hi> "souls and bodies" is taken as a matter of course, in
											<cit><quote><l><mentioned>Souls and bodies</mentioned>

								<bibl n="shak. tn 3.4.260"><title><abbr>T. N.</abbr></title> iii. 4.

						<p>(3) Hence participles (since they imply a relative), and any adjectives
							that from their terminations resemble participles, are peculiarly liable
							to be thus transposed.</p>
						<p>Similarly adjectives that end in <hi rend="italics">-ble, -ite,</hi> and
								<hi rend="italics">-t, -ive, -al,</hi> are often found after their
							nouns, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> "unspeakable," "unscaleable,"
							"impregnable;" "absolute," "devout," "remote," "infinite" (often),
							"past," "inveterate;" "compulsative," "invasive," "defective;"
							"capital," "tyrannical," "virginal," "angelical," "unnatural."</p>
						<p>(4) Though it may be generally said that when the noun is unemphatic, and
							the adjective is not a mere epithet but essential to the sense, the
							transposition may be expected, yet it is probable that the influence of
							the French idiom made this transposition especially common in the case
							of some words derived from French. Hence, perhaps, the transposition in

						<p>Transposition of adjectival phrases.</p>
						<p>It has been shown above (419), that when an adjective is not a mere
							epithet, but expresses something essential, and implies a relative, it
							is often placed after the noun. When, however, connected with the
							adjective, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> "whiter," there is some
							adverbial phrase, <hi rend="italics">e.g.</hi> "than snow," it was felt
							that to place the adjective after the noun might sometimes destroy the
							connection between the noun and adjective, since the adjective was, as
							it were, drawn forward to the modifying adverb. Hence the Elizabethans
							sometimes preferred to place the adjectival part of the adjective
							before, and the adverbial part after, the noun. The noun generally being
							unemphatic caused but slight separation between the two parts of the
							adjectival phrase. Thus "whiter than snow," being an adjectival phrase,
							"whiter" is inserted before, and "than snow" after, the noun.

							suppose that Shakespeare in his tragic metre introduces the trisyllabic

							are peculiarly adapted for monosyllabic and trisyllabic feet. It is part
							of the purpose of the following paragraphs to indicate the laws which
							regulate these licences. In many cases it is impossible to tell whether
							in a trisyllabic foot an unemphatic syllable is merely slurred or wholly
							suppressed, as for instance the first <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in

							two out of three have four, and one out of fifteen has three. But as
							different readers will emphasize differently, not much importance can be

						<p>The extra syllable is very rarely a monosyllable, still more rarely an

						<p>Naturally it is among pronouns and the auxiliary verbs that we must look

						<p>Accented Monosyllabic Prepositions. Walker (Crit. on Shakespeare, ii.
							173-5) proves conclusively that "of" in "out <hi rend="italic">of</hi>"
							frequently has the accent. Thus: <pb n="337"/><cit><quote>The fount out

						<p>Many other passages quoted by Walker are doubtful, but he brings forward
							a statement of Daniel, who, remarking that a trochee is inadmissible at
							the beginning of an iambic verse of four feet, instances: <quote
								rend="blockquote">Yearly out <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his wat'ry
								cell,</quote> which shows that he regarded "out &oacute;f" as an
							iambus. Walker conjectures "that the pronunciation (of monosyllabic
							prepositions) was in James the First's time beginning to fluctuate, and
							that Massinger was a partisan of the old mode." Hence, probably, the
							prepositions received the accent in <cit><quote>Such m&eacute;n | as

							foot, but the instances that have been pointed out are restricted to the
							first foot. <cit><quote><hi rend="italic">May,</hi> | with all thyn

						<p>Fear, dear, fire, hour, your, four, and other monosyllables ending in r
							or re, preceded by a long vowel or diphthong, are frequently pronounced
							as dissyllables. Thus "fire" was often spelt and is still vulgarly
							pronounced "fier." So "fare" seems to have been pronounced "fa-er;"

						<head>LENGTHENING OF WORDS. Monosyllables, when prolonged</head>
						<p>Monosyllables which are emphatic either (1) from their meaning, as in the

							or (3) which contain diphthongs, or (4) vowels preceding <hi
								rend="italic">r,</hi> often take the place of a whole foot. This is
							less frequent in dissyllabic words. In (1) and (2) as well as (3) the

							<pb n="374"/>it is possible to prolong the preceding monosyllable, "the

							cases may often be left to the taste of the reader (but for the accent
							of "into" see 457<hi rend="italic">a</hi>). All that can safely be said
							is, that when a very unemphatic monosyllable, as "at," "and," "a,"
							"the," &amp;c. has the accent, it is generally preceded or followed by a

						<head>LENGTHENING OF WORDS. Monosyllables, diphthongs and long vowels</head>
						<p>Monosyllables containing diphthongs and long vowels, since they naturally
							allow the voice to rest upon them, are often so emphasized as to
							dispense with an unaccented syllable. When the monosyllables are
							imperatives of verbs, as "speak," or nouns used imperatively, like

						<head>LENGTHENING OF WORDS. Words in which the accent is nearer the end than

						<p>Words in which the accent is nearer the end than with us.</p>
						<p>Many words, such as "edict," "outrage," "contract," &amp;c., are accented
							in a varying manner. The key to this inconsistency is, perhaps, to be
							found in Ben Jonson's remark that all dissyllabic nouns, <hi
								rend="italic">if they be simple,</hi> are accented on the first.
							Hence "edict" and "outrage" would generally be accented on the first,
							but, when they were regarded as <hi rend="italic">derived from
								verbs,</hi> they would be accented on the second. And so, perhaps,
							when "exile" is regarded as a person, and therefore a "simple" noun, the
							accent is on the first; but when as "the state of being exiled," it is
							on the last. But naturally, where the difference is so slight, much
							variety may be expected. Ben Jonson adds that "all verbs coming from the
							Latin, either of the supine or otherwise, hold the accent as it is found
							in the first person present of those Latin verbs; as from <hi
								rend="italic">c&eacute;lebro, c&eacute;lebrate.</hi>" Without
							entering into the details of this rule, it seems probable that
							"ed&iacute;ct," "prec&eacute;pt," betray Latin influence. The same
							fluctuation between the English and French accent is found in <hi
								rend="smallcap">CHAUCER</hi> (Prof. Child, quoted by Ellis, <hi
								rend="italic">E. E. Pronunc.</hi> i. 369), who uses

						<head>Verses with four accents assigned to witches, fairies, &amp;c.

						<p>The verse with four accents is rarely used by Shakespeare, except when

						<p>It would be, perhaps, more correct to say that both lines are trochaic,

						<p>It is of course possible that "kill-curt'sy" may have the accent on the

						<p>Rhyme. Rhyme was often used as an effective termination at the end of the

						<p>Similarity.--In order to describe an <hi rend="italic">object</hi> that
							has not been seen we use the description of some object or objects that
							have been seen. Thus, to describe a lion to a person who had never seen
							one, we should say that it had something like a horse's mane, the claws
							of a cat, &amp;c. We might say, "A lion is like a monstrous cat with a
							horse's mane." This sentence expresses a likeness of things, or a <hi
								rend="italic">similarity:</hi></p>

					<div3 id="par517" type="paragraph" n="517">
						<head/>
						<p>Simile.--In order to describe some <hi rend="italic">relation</hi> that
							cannot be seen, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> the relation between a ship
							and the water, as regards the action of the former upon the latter, to a
							landsman who had never seen the sea or a ship, we might say, "The ship
							acts upon the water as a plough turns up the land." In other words, "The
								<hi rend="italic">relation</hi> between the ship and the sea is <hi
								rend="italic">similar</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">relation</hi>
							between the plough and the land." This sentence expresses <hi
								rend="italic">a similarity of relations,</hi> and is called <hi
								rend="italic">a simile.</hi> It is frequently expressed thus:</p>
						<p>"As the plough turns up the land, so the ship acts on the sea."</p>
						<p>
							<hi rend="italic">Def.</hi>
							<hi rend="bold">A Simile is a sentence expressing a similarity of
								relations.</hi>
						</p>
						<p>Consequently a simile is a kind of rhetorical proportion, and must, when
							fully expressed, contain four terms:</p>
						<p>A : B :: C : D.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="par518" type="paragraph" n="518">
						<head/>
						<p>Compression of Simile into Metaphor.--A simile is cumbrous, and better
							suited for poetry than for prose. Moreover, when a simile has been long
							in use, there is a tendency to consider the assimilated relations not
							merely as <hi rend="italic">similar</hi> but as <hi rend="italic"
								>identical.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">simile</hi> modestly asserts
							that the relation <pb n="431"/>between the ship and the sea is <hi
								rend="italic">like</hi> ploughing. The <hi rend="italic">compressed
								simile</hi> goes further, and asserts that the relation between the
							ship and the sea <hi rend="italic">is</hi> ploughing. It is expressed
							thus: "The ship ploughs the sea."</p>
						<p>Thus the relation between the plough and the land is <hi rend="italic"
								>transferred</hi> to the ship and the sea. A simile thus compressed
							is called a <hi rend="italic">Metaphor,</hi> i.e. <hi rend="italic"
								>transference.</hi></p>
						<p>
							<hi rend="italic">Def.</hi>
							<hi rend="bold">A Metaphor is a transference of the relation between one

								explanation.</hi>
						</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="par519" type="paragraph" n="519">
						<head/>
						<p>Metaphor fully stated or implied.--A metaphor may be either fully stated,
							as "The ship <hi rend="italic">ploughs</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">is the
								plough of</hi>) <hi rend="italic">the sea,</hi>" or implied, as "The
							winds are the horses that draw <hi rend="italic">the plough of the
								sea.</hi>" In the former case it is distinctly stated, in the latter
							implied, that the "plough of the sea" represents a ship.</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="par520" type="paragraph" n="520">
						<head/>
						<p>Implied Metaphor the basis of language.--A great part of our ordinary
							language, all that relates to the relations of invisible things,
							necessarily consists of <hi rend="italic">implied metaphors;</hi> for we
							can only describe invisible relations by means of visible ones. We are
							in the habit of assuming the existence of a certain proportion or <hi
								rend="italic">analogy</hi> between the relations of the mind and
							those of the body. This <hi rend="italic">analogy</hi> is the foundation
							of all words that express mental and moral qualities. For example, we do
							not know how a thought suggests itself suddenly to the mind, but we <hi
								rend="italic">do</hi> know how an external object makes itself felt
							by the body. Experience teaches us that anything which <hi rend="italic"
								>strikes</hi> the body makes itself suddenly felt. Analogy suggests
							that whatever <hi rend="italic">is suddenly perceived comes in the same
								way</hi> into contact with the mind. Hence the simile--"As a stone
							strikes the body, so a thought makes itself perceptible to the mind."
							This simile may be compressed into the <hi rend="italic">full</hi>
							metaphor thus, "The thought struck my mind," or into the <hi
								rend="italic">implied</hi> metaphor thus, "This is a <pb n="432"
							/>striking thought." In many words that express immaterial objects the
							implied metaphor can easily be traced through the derivation, as in
							"excellence," "tribulation," "integrity," "spotlessness," &amp;c.</p>
						<p>N.B. The use of metaphor is well illustrated in words that describe the
							effects of sound. Since the sense of hearing (probably in all nations
							and certainly among the English) is less powerful and less suggestive of
							words than the senses of sight, taste, and touch, the poorer sense is
							compelled to borrow a part of its vocabulary from the richer senses.
							Thus we talk of "a <hi rend="italic">sweet</hi> voice," "a <hi
								rend="italic">soft</hi> whisper," "a <hi rend="italic">sharp</hi>
							scream," "a <hi rend="italic">piercing</hi> shriek," and the Romans used
							the expression "a <hi rend="italic">dark-coloured</hi> voice,"<note
								anchored="yes">"Vox <hi rend="italic">fusca.</hi>"</note> where we
							should say "a <hi rend="italic">rough</hi> voice."</p>

						<p>Metaphor expanded.--As every <hi rend="italic">simile</hi> can be <hi
								rend="italic">compressed</hi> into a <hi rend="italic"
								>metaphor,</hi> so, conversely, every <hi rend="italic"
								>metaphor</hi> can be <hi rend="italic">expanded</hi> into its <hi
								rend="italic">simile.</hi> The following is the rule for expansion.
							It has been seen above that the simile consists of four terms. In the
							third term of the simile stands the subject ("ship," for instance) whose
							unknown predicated relation ("action of ship on water") is to be
							explained. In the first term stands the corresponding subject ("plough")
							whose predicated relation ("action on land") is known. In the second
							term is the known relation. The fourth term is the unknown predicated
							relation which requires explanation. Thus-- <table>
								<row role="data"><cell role="data" cols="1" rows="1">the
										plough</cell>
									<cell role="data" cols="1" rows="1">turns up the land,</cell>
									<cell role="data" cols="1" rows="1">so</cell>

									<cell role="data" cols="1" rows="1">Subject whose predicate is
										unknown.</cell>
									<cell role="data" cols="1" rows="1">Unknown
									predicate.</cell></row>
							</table> Sometimes the fourth term or unknown predicate may represent
							something that has received no name in the language. Thus, if we take
							the words of Hamlet, "In my mind's eye," the metaphor when expanded
							would become-- <pb n="433"/>
							<table>
								<row role="data"><cell role="data" cols="1" rows="1">As</cell>
									<cell role="data" cols="1" rows="1">the body</cell>
									<cell role="data" cols="1" rows="1">is enlightened by the

									<cell role="data" cols="1" rows="1">Subject whose predicate is
										unknown.</cell>
									<cell role="data" cols="1" rows="1">Unknown
									predicate.</cell></row>
							</table> For several centuries there was no word in the Latin language
							to describe this "perceptive faculty of the mind." At last they coined
							the word "imaginatio," which appears in English as "imagination." This
							word is found as early as Chaucer; but it is quite conceivable that the
							English lan guage should, like the Latin, have passed through its best
							period without any single word to describe the "mind's eye."</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="par522" type="paragraph" n="522">
						<head/>
						<p> The details of the expansion will vary according to the point and
							purpose of the metaphor. Thus, when Macbeth (act iii. sc. 1) says that
							he has "given his eternal jewel to the common enemy of man," the point
							of the metaphor is apparently the pricelessness of a pure soul or good
							conscience, and the metaphor might be expanded thus--</p>
						<p>"As a jewel is precious to the man who wears it, so is a good conscience
							precious to the man who possesses it."</p>
						<p>But in <hi rend="italic">Rich. II.</hi> i. 1. 180, the same metaphor is
							expanded with reference to the necessity for its safe preservation :--
								<quote rend="blockquote">A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest Is a
								bold spirit in a loyal breast.</quote></p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="par523" type="paragraph" n="523">
						<head/>
						<p>Personal Metaphor.--There is a universal desire among men that visible
							nature, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> mountains, winds, trees, rivers and
							the like, should have a power of sympathising with men. This desire
							begets a kind of poetical belief that such a sympathy actually exists.
							Further, the vocabulary expressing the variable moods of man is so much
							richer than that which expresses the changes of nature that the latter
							borrows from the former. Hence the <hi rend="italic">morn</hi> is said
							to <hi rend="italic">laugh, mountains</hi> to <hi rend="italic">frown,
								winds</hi> to <hi rend="italic">whisper, rivulets</hi> to <hi
								rend="italic">prattle,</hi>
							<pb n="434"/><hi rend="italic">oaks</hi> to <hi rend="italic">sigh.</hi>
							Hence arises what may be called Personal Metaphor.</p>
						<p>
							<hi rend="italic">Def.</hi>
							<hi rend="bold">A Personal Metaphor is a transference of personal

								explanation.</hi>
						</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="par524" type="paragraph" n="524">
						<head/>
						<p>Personal Metaphors expanded.--The first term will always be "a person;"
							the second, the predicated relation properly belonging to the person and
							improperly transferred to the impersonal object; the third, the
							impersonal object. Thus--</p>
						<p>"As a person frowns, so an overhanging mountain (looks gloomy).</p>
						<p>"As a child prattles, so a brook (makes a ceaseless cheerful
							clatter)."</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="par525" type="paragraph" n="525">
						<head/>
						<p>Personifications.--Men are liable to certain feelings, such as shame,
							fear, repentance and the like, which seem <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to
							be originated by the <hi rend="italic">person,</hi> but to come upon him
							from without. For this reason such <hi rend="italic">impersonal</hi>
							feelings are in some languages represented by <hi rend="italic"
								>impersonal</hi> verbs. In Latin these verbs are numerous, "pudet,"
							"piget," "t&aelig;det," "p&oelig;nitet," "libet," &amp;c. In Early
							English they were still more numerous, and even now we retain not only
							"it snows," "it rains," but also (though more rarely) "methinks,"
							"meseems," "it shames me," "it repents me." Men are, however, not
							contented with <hi rend="italic">separating</hi> their feelings from
							their own <hi rend="italic">person;</hi> they also feel a desire to
							account for them. For this purpose they have often imagined as the
							causes of their feelings, Personal Beings, such as Hope, Fear, Faith,
							&amp;c. Hence arose what may be called <hi rend="italic"
								>Personification.</hi></p>
						<p>In later times men have ceased to believe in the personal existence of
							Hope and Fear, Graces and nymphs, Flora and Boreas; but poets still use
							Personification, for the purpose of setting before us with greater
							vividness the invisible operations of the human mind and the slow and
							imperceptible processes of inanimate nature. <pb n="435"/></p>

					<div3 id="par526" type="paragraph" n="526">
						<head/>
						<p>Personifications cannot be expanded.--The process of expansion into
							simile can be performed in the case of a Personal Metaphor, because
							there is implied a comparison between a Person and an impersonal object.
							But the process cannot be performed where (as in Personifications) the
							impersonal object has no material existence, but is the mere creation of
							the fancy, and presents no point of comparison. "A frowning mountain"
							can be expanded, because there is implied a comparison between a
							mountain and a person, a gloom and a frown. But "frowning Wrath" cannot
							be expanded, because there is no comparison.</p>
						<p>It is the essence of a metaphor that it should be literally false, as in
							"a frowning mountain." It is the essence of a personification that,
							though founded on imagination, it is conceived to be literally true, as
							in "pale fear," "dark dishonour." A painter would represent "death" as
							"pale," and "dishonour" as "dark," though he would not represent a
							"mountain" with a "frown," or a "ship" like a "plough."</p>
					</div3>
					<div3 id="par527" type="paragraph" n="527">
						<head/>
						<p>Apparent Exception.--The only case where a simile is involved and an
							expansion is possible is where a person, as for instance Mars, the God
							of War, is represented as doing something which he is not imagined to do
							literally. Thus the phrase "Mars mows down his foes" is not literally
							true. No painter would represent Mars (though he would Time) with a
							scythe. It is therefore a metaphor and, as such, capable of expansion
							thus :--</p>
						<p>"As easily as a haymaker mows down the grass, so easily does Mars cut
							down his foes with his sword."</p>
						<p>But the phrase "Mars slays his foes" is, from a poet's or painter's point
							of view, literally true. It is therefore no metaphor, and cannot be
							expanded. <pb n="436"/></p>

						<p>Personification analysed.--Though we cannot expand a Personification into

								>cause</hi> and <hi rend="italic">effect.</hi> This belief, which is
							embodied in the line-- <quote rend="blockquote">Who drives fat oxen
								should himself be fat,</quote> is the basis of all Personification.
							Since fear makes men look pale, and dishonour gives a dark and scowling
							expression to the face, it is inferred that Fear <hi rend="italic"
								>is</hi> "pale," and Dishonour "dark." And in the same way Famine is
							"gaunt;" Jealousy "green-eyed;" Faith "pure-eyed;" Hope
							"white-handed."</p>

						<head/>
						<p>Good and bad Metaphors.--There are certain laws regulating the formation
							and employment of metaphors which should be borne in mind.</p>
						<p>(1.) <hi rend="italic">A metaphor must not be used unless it is needed
								for explanation or vividness, or to throw light upon the thought of
								the speaker.</hi> Thus the speech of the Gardener, <hi rend="italic"
								>Rich. II.</hi> iii. 4. 33,-- <quote rend="blockquote">Go then, and
								like an executioner<lb/> Cut off the heads of our fast-growing
								sprays, &amp;c.</quote> is inappropriate to the character of the
							speaker, and conveys an allusion instead of an explanation. It
							illustrates what is familiar by what is unfamiliar, and can only be
							justified by the fact that the gardener is thinking of the disordered
							condition of the kingdom of England and the necessity of a powerful king
							to repress unruly subjects.</p>
						<p>(2.) <hi rend="italic">A metaphor must not enter too much into
								detail:</hi> for every additional detail increases the improbability
							that the correspondence of the whole comparison can be sustained. Thus,
							if King Richard (<hi rend="italic">Rich. II.</hi> v. 5. 50) had been
							content, while musing on the manner in which he could count time by his
							sighs, to say-- <quote rend="blockquote">For now hath Time made me his
								numbering clock,</quote>
							<pb n="437"/>there would have been little or no offence against taste.
							But when he continues-- <quote rend="blockquote">My thoughts are
								minutes, and with sighs they jar<lb/> Their watches on unto mine
								eyes, the outward watch,<lb/> Whereto my finger, like a dial's
								point,<lb/> Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.<lb/>
								Now, sir, the sound that tells what hour it is<lb/> Are clamorous
								groans which strike upon my heart,<lb/> Which is the bell,--</quote>
							we have an excess of detail which is only justified because it
							illustrates the character of one who is always "studying to
								compare,"<note anchored="yes">
								<cit><quote>I have been <hi rend="italic">studying how I may
											compare</hi><lb/> This prison where I live unto the
										world;<lb/> * * * * *<lb/> I cannot do it; yet I'll <hi
											rend="italic">hammer it out.</hi></quote>
									<bibl><hi rend="italic">Rich. II.</hi> v. 5.
								1.</bibl></cit></note> and "hammering out" unnatural
							comparisons.</p>
						<p>(3.) <hi rend="italic">A metaphor must not be far-fetched nor dwell upon
								the details of a disgusting picture:</hi>
							<cit><quote>Here lay Duncan,<lb/> His <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> skin
										<hi rend="italic">laced</hi> with his <hi rend="italic"
										>golden</hi> blood;<lb/> . . . . . there the murderers<lb/>
									Steep'd in the colours of their trade, <hi rend="italic">their
										daggers</hi><lb/>
									<hi rend="italic">Unmannerly breech'd with gore.</hi></quote>
								<bibl><hi rend="italic">Macbeth,</hi> ii. 3. 117.</bibl></cit> There
							is but little, and that far-fetched, similarity between <hi
								rend="italic">gold lace</hi> and <hi rend="italic">blood,</hi> or
							between <hi rend="italic">bloody daggers</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
								>breech'd</hi> legs. The slightness of the similarity, recalling the
							greatness of the dissimilarity, disgusts us with the attempted
							comparison. Language so forced is only appropriate in the mouth of a
							conscious murderer dissembling guilt.</p>
						<p>(4.) <hi rend="italic">Two metaphors must not be confused together,
								particularly if the action of the one is inconsistent with the
								action of the other.</hi></p>
						<p>It may be pardonable to <hi rend="italic">surround,</hi> as it were, one
							metaphor with another. Thus, fear may be compared to an aguefit, and an
							ague-fit passing away may be compared to the overblowing of a storm.
							Hence, "This ague-fit of fear is overblown" (<hi rend="italic">Rich.

						<p>"A king is the pilot of the state," is a good metaphor. "A careful
