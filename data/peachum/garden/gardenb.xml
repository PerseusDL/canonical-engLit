        <p>Schemates Rhetorical be those figures or forms of speaking, which do take away the
          wearisomnesse of our common speech, and do fashion a pleasant, sharpe, and evident kind of
          expressing our meaning: which by the artificiall forme doth give unto matters great
          strength, perspicuitie and grace, which figures be devided into three orders.</p>

        <div type="commentary" subtype="order" n="1"> <head>The first order</head>

          <p>The first order containeth those figures which do make the oration plaine, pleasant,
            and beautifull, pertaining rather to words then to sentences, and rather to harmonie and
            plesant proportion, then to gravitie and dignitie, and the figures of this first order I
            devide into fower kinds, according to their sundrie formes, of which the first are of
              <term>Repetition,</term> the second of <term>Omission</term>, the third of
              <term>conjunction</term>, the fourth of <term>separation</term>.</p>

                    vertue and counsell of this man delivered: A witnesse is Celicia, which being
                    environed on every side with many and great dangers, he set at libertie, not
                    with terror of warre, but quicknesse of counsel: A witnesse is Africa, which
                    being opprest with great armies of enemies, flowed with the blood of slaine men:
                    A witnesse is France, through which a way was made with great slaughter of
                    Frenchmen for our armies into Spaine: A witnesse is Spaine, which hath very

                <p>Although this figure be an exornation of great use, yet it may be too often used
                  in an oration. Secondly ye repetitions ought not to be many, I meane the word

                    <term>Tautalogie</term>. Thirdly heede ought to be taken, that the word which is
                  least worthie or most weake, be not taken to make the repetition, for that were
                  very absurd.</p>

              </div>

              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                <p>It appeareth by experience that this figure is not commonly used by eloquent
                  authors, but sparingly, and as it were thinly <note place="marg" anchored="false"
                    >2.Not to be often used.</note> sprinkled, as all exornations are, and therefore
                  it ought not to be too much in use, if we desire to follow the examples of the
                  most eloquent authors. </p>

            </div>

            <div type="commentary" subtype="figure" n="Symploce"><head><term>Symploce</term>.</head>
              

                <p><term>Symploce</term> is a forme of speech which maketh many members or clauses
                  following to have the same beginning &amp; the same ending which the first had
                  going before, comprising both the last ornaments in one. </p>

                <p>An example of Cicero: who were they that often brake their leagues? the
                  Carthaginians? Who were they that made cruell warre in Italie? the Carthaginians,
                  Who defaced all Italie? the Carthaginians. Who crave pardon now? the
                  Carthaginians. </p>
                <p>Another: Him would you pardon and acquite by your sentence, whom the Senate hath
                  condemned, whom the people of Rome have condemned, whom all men have condemned. </p>
                <p>By the increase of a word in the clause following, thus, Dido builded Carthage.
                  Dido builded renowned Carthage. </p>
                <p>By the increase of a word in diverse clauses: O cruell death, why hast thou taken
                  away my father, my deare father, my deare and most loving father , and hid him in
                  the darke, where I cannot find him? </p>

                <p><note place="marg" anchored="false">1.Meete for any affection.</note>This figure
                  may serve to any affection, and is a singular ornament, pleasant to the eare,
                  which of some is called the <term>Rhetoricall circle</term>, <note place="marg"
                    anchored="false">2.Pleasant to the eare.</note> and of others the <term>Musicall

                    Rhetoricall circle.</note> it is so much more pleasant as it is used more
                  sparingly. </p>
              </div>
              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                <p><note place="marg" anchored="false">1.Too many members do not well. </note>Too
                  many members of this figure do much blemish the beautie of it, and bewrayeth the
                  affectation, for this ornament is much deformed if it be stretched with the
                  tenters of foolish fancie, as oft it is, and likewise many others. </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div type="commentary" subtype="figure" n="Ploce"><head><term>Ploce</term>.</head>

              

                <p><term>Ploce</term> is a forme of speech by which a proper name being repeated,
                  signifieth another thing. </p>
                <p>An example: Yet at that day Memmius was Memmius, in the first place Memmius is
                  the proper name of a man, but in the second, it signifieth his manners, which were
                  well knowne. </p>
                <p>Another: In that great victorie Caesar was Caesar, that is, a mercifull
                  conquerer. </p>
                <p>Another: Cicero continued Cicero unto the day of his death, meaning, a lover of
                  his countrey, and a most faithfull patrone of the common wealth. </p>
              
              <div type="commentary"><head>The use of this figure.</head>

                <p>This exornation serveth aptly to signifie the constant nature or permanent
                  qualitie of a man well knowne, by the repetition of his name: it containeth in it
                  also a repetition pleasant for the brevitie, as when we say Memmius was Memmius,
                  Casear <note place="marg" anchored="false">1.Brevitie.</note> was Caesar, and
                  likewise for the <term>Emphaticall</term> signification in the repeated name.
                    <note place="marg" anchored="false">2.Emphatical singnification.</note>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                <p>It is good to foresee that the proper name which we purpose to repeate be ye name
                  of such a one, as is or hath bene wel known,<note place="marg" anchored="false"
                    >1.The man ought to be well knowne whose name is repeated.</note> and likewise
                  his maners and naturall inclination: otherwise it must needs be a sounding
                  repetition without sense. </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div type="commentary" subtype="figure" n="Diaphora"><head><term>Diaphora</term>.</head>

              

                <p><term>Diaphora</term> is much like to <term>Ploce</term>, but yet they differ,
                  onely in this, that <term>Ploce</term> repeateth a proper name, and this a common
                  word. An example: What man is there living but will pitie such a case: if he be a
                  man, in the repetition man signifieth humanity, or compassion proper to mans
                  nature. </p>
                <p>Another: If your cause be just, feare not the Judge, for he wil do right because
                  he is a Judge. In the former place Judge signifieth his person and authoritie, in
                  the later, the consideration and speciall end of possessing that authoritie. </p>
                <p>Another: Phisition heale thy selfe if thoug beest a Phisition, that is, if thou
                  hast the skill and science of Phisicke. </p>
              
              <div type="commentary"><head>The use of this figure.</head>

                <p>This figure like as <term>Ploce</term>, serveth both to the pleasure of the<note
                    place="marg" anchored="false">1.Pleasant to the eare.</note> and sense of the
                    mind.<note place="marg" anchored="false">2.Emphaticall.</note>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                  from dishonestie, either feare from perill, or reason from madnesse. Here the
                  verbe could call backe is the common word which is exprest in the first clause,
                  and understood in the rest following. </p>
                <p>Another: The people of Rome destroyed Numance, wan Carthage, cast downe Corinth,
                  overthrew Frigellas. In this example the people of Rome is the common word. </p>
                <p>Another: Povertie hath gotten conquest of thy riches, shame of thy pride, danger
                  of thy safetie, folly of thy wisedome, weakenesse of thy strength, and time of thy
                  imagined immortalitie. </p>
                <p>2 <term>Mezozeugma</term> the second kind, when the common word is put in the
                  middle clause. An example: What a shame is this, that neither hope of reward, nor
                  feare of reproch could any thing move him, neither the perswasion of his friends,
                  nor the love of his countrey. </p>
                <p>3 <term>Hypozeugma</term> the third kind, when the common word is put in the last
                  clause. An example: The foundation of freedome, the fountaine of equitie, the
                  safegard of wealth, and custodie of life, is preserved by lawes. </p>

                  clauses, put before the last clause wherein it is exprest, it doth hold the mind
                  of the hearer in too long dispense. It is good to avoyd this figure in writing of

                  clause, but not in the other: nowe that the same word is understood in the other
                  it is likely, but not proved: and therefore may breed a question. </p>

                    <term>Parison</term> is a figure or forme of speech which maketh the members of
                  an oration to be almost of a just number of sillables, yet the equalitie of those
                  members or parts, are not to be measured upon our fingers, as if they were verses,
                  but to bee tried by a secret sence of the eare: use &amp; exercise may do much in
                  this behalfe, which maketh it an easie matter to make the parts accourd in a fit
                  proportion. First, when the former parts of a sentence, or of an oration be
                  answered by the later, and that by proper words respecting the former. </p>

                <p>An example of Cicero: He left the citie garnished, that the same might be a
                  monument of victory, of clemencie, of continencie, that men might see, what he had
                  conquered, what he spared, what he had left: compare ye the parts of the later
                  clauses with the former, and you shall see how fitly they are matched. </p>
                <p>Examples of the holy scripture, as when the sentence consisteth of two members,
                  thus: <cit>
                    <quote>The Ox hath knowne his owner, and the Asse his maisters crib.</quote>

                      streame.</quote>

                </p>
                <p>Also it coopleth contraries, thus: An innocent although he be accused, he may be
                  acquited, but the guiltie except he be accused he cannot be condemned. </p>
                <p>Also by this figure effects may be made to answer their efficients, consequents
                  their antecedents, habite privation: also contrariwis, and that by a very pleasant

                <p>This is worthy by the way to be noted, that albeit singuler examples are here set
                  for the explication of singular affections or passions, yet notwithstanding many
                  and iverse affections may meete and joyne in causing of our exclamation, as may be
                  seene in the example of Paul to Timothie last expressed: O man of God flee such
                  things. </p>
                <p>The causes of this exlamation are more than one: There is love in Paul toward
                  Timothie, for because he loveth him he disswadeth him from danger. There is feare
                  in Paul, for that which he possesseth by love, he feareth lest it should be lsot
                  by negligence. </p>
                <p>There is also in Paul an hatred of the evil, from which he doth disswade
                  Timothie. There is in Paul a care of Gods glory lest it should be obscured in his
                  owne servant: all which affections joyning together caused the Apostle to say: O
                  thou man of God flee such thinges. </p>

                <p>Lsstly, that it be not put in the conclusion of an oration or publike speech, for
                  in so doing it might be the cause of merry effect. </p>

                <p><term>Euche</term>, in latine <term>Votum</term>, is a forme of speech by which
                  the Orator or speaker expresseth a solemne promise or vow; either made with
                  condition, or rising from some vehement affection. </p>
                <p>Examples of vowes made with condition. First of Jacob, Ge.28.21. Then Jacob vowed
                  a vow saying: If God wil be with me, and will keep me in this journey which I go,
                  and wil give me bread to eate, and cloth to put on, so that I come againe unto my
                  father in safetie. Then shall the Lord be my God, and this stone which I have set
                  up as a pillar, shall be Gods house, and of all that thou shalt give me, will I
                  give the tenth unto thee. </p>
                <p>Another of Jeptah: And Jeptah vowed a vow unto the Lord and sayd, I thou shalt
                  deliver the children of Ammon into my hands then that thing that commeth out of my
                  house to meet me when I come home in peace from the children of Ammon, shall be
                  the Lords, and I will offer it for a burnt offring. </p>
                <p>An example of a vow rising from affection, and without condition, is expressed in
                  the Psalme 132. </p>

                  hanged, or that the Evill will one day fetch them, it would be a very wofull world
                  if all such Prognostications should prove true: but for as much as they seldome
                  take effect, the malicious planet is generally contemned, and the false

                <p>Fiftly, it is wont to be abused by foolish observations of certaine accidences,

                    excusatio</term> is a forme of speech by which the speaker alledgeth a
                  premeditated excuse conteining reasons of such might as are able to vanquish all
                  objections. A most artificall example hereof is found in the answere of Aeneas to
                  Dido, in the 4. booke of Aeneidos, whereof I have gathered the summe both of the
                  objections of Dido, and of the answeres &amp; excuses of Aeneas, and have put them
                  into partes as they stand in the Author, and first of her objection then after of
                  his excuse and answere. </p>

                <p>First, she objecteth by her suspition gathered from probable tokens<note

                  wicked purpose to steale away from her, to whom she declareth her most fervant
                  love, charging him with his promise, faithfully plighted to her. </p>
                <p>Secondly, she telleth him that for his sake, she is hated of forraine<note
                    place="marg" anchored="false">2.</note> Princes, and despised of her owne
                  people, that for his sake her high and exalted fame were utterly lost. </p>
                <p>Thirdly, she declareth that for his sake the danger of conquest<note place="marg"
                    anchored="false">3.</note> both of Carthage and her kingdome were most like to
                  ensue, if he should wilfully persist, &amp; wickedly proceed in this his evil
                  purpose, which did most wofully and grievously appeare unto her. </p>

                <p>To whose objection Aeneas maketh an anwere consisting of many parts as followeth:
                  First he confesseth her kindnesse, goodnesse, and liberalitie. Secondly, he uterly
                  denieth that ever his entent was to depart by stealth. Thirdly, he telleth her
                  that wedlocke was never his meaning, nor his commng. Fourthly, he saith, that he
                  greatly desireth to restore his ancient citie of Troy. Fifthly, he alledgeth that
                  ye Oracle of Apollo calleth him from Carthage to Italy. Sixtly, he argueth from
                  equall comparison, that if she might take delight and pleasure to ddwell in
                  Carthage her native Citie and country, why might not the Troyans likewise repaire
                  to the land which they most longed after? Seventhly, he sheweth her that his
                  fathers ghost doth every night warn him away. Eightly, that he did wrong to his
                  sonne Ascamus, to withhold him so long from Italy, his promised enheritance.
                  Ninthly, he signifieth that by a message from God himselfe, both appearing to his
                  eyes and sounding in his eares, he is commanded to remove and depart from thence,
                  and therfore wisheth her to content her selfe, and cease her wailing for his love
                  which might not prevaile, and therefore in vaine. </p>

                  commeth before his family, as soone as he saw Esau, he shewed a signe of dutiful
                  submission he bowed himselfe seven times most humbly before he came neare to him,
                  calling him his Lord, and himselfe his servant, his family al children came

                  flaming wrath of Esau was turned into teares of compassion. </p>
                <p>The lyke example of submission there is in the third Chapter of Judith, where the
                  Embassadores of the Israelites, do deliver their humble submission of Olophernes,
                  in these words saying: Behold we are the servants of Navucodonozor the great King,

                  therefore refuse not thou the chastening of the almightie, for he maketh the wound
                  and bindeth it up, he smiteth and his hand maketh whole. AFter this he addeth many
                  branches of Gods mercy, loving kindnesse, and fatherly protection towards his
                  children, and thereupon concludeth that Job ought to apply all these
                  considerations to himselfe, as most precious medicines able to minister
                  consolation and strength to his fainting spirit. </p>
              
              <div type="commentary"><head>The use of this figure.</head>

                <p>The use of this figure is great, and most necessarily required in this vale of
                  misery, where mens harts are often fainting, and their mindes falling into
                  despaire, for so great are mens losses in this fraile life, and so little is their
                  fortitude to beare them, that they fall downe in their weaknesse lying still
                  opprest under their heavy burthen, never able to rise againe, without the strength
                  of comfort and consolation: for so great is the infirmitie and frailty of man
                  being left alone to himselfe in affliction and misery, that he is compared to the
                  waxe that melteth at the heate of the fire &amp; to the smok ye is driven away
                  with ye power of ye wind. Against this weaknesse, consolation ministreth strength
                  &amp; restoreth men to life and joy, that were dying in misery and sorrow. </p>

              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                <p>The first point of care and regard in the use of this figure is<note place="marg"
                    anchored="false">1. Consolation among scorners unmeete.</note> to take heede
                  that consolation be not applyed where correction and commination be more
                  needefully required, as thy do which apply the use of comfort to hypocrites and
                  scorners of Gods judgements. </p>
                <p>Secondly, that it be not minsistred out of season, as either too<note
                    place="marg" anchored="false">2. Oportunity necessary to be observed.</note>
                  soone, when the wound is new made, and the bloud running swiftly in the streame of
                  effusion, I meane the sorrow newly begun, and the affections confounded with the
                  beholding, and consideration of the wofull losse or miserie: or too late, as when
                  the sorrow is either forgotten, or wel asswaged, for then it may by a needlesse
                  remembrance rather renew and call against the sorrow nye at an end, then utterly
                  quench it. </p>
                <p>Thirdly, that it be not unproper and impertinent to the cause and necessitie to
                  which it is applyed. </p>
                <p>Fourthly, that it be not weake by reason of the foundations consisting only in
                  Philosophy and humane wisedome which do many times rather increase sorrow theen
                  diminish it: these and many mo such like faultes offending against the true forme
                  of consolation ought most carefully and diligently to be shunned, otherwise the
                  use of consolation shall take small effect. </p>

                <p><term>Eucharistia</term> in Latine <term>Gratiarum actio</term>, is a forme of
                  speech, bu which the speaker geveth thankes for benefites received. </p>
                <p>An example of Cicero: To thee O Caesar wee give most harty thankes, yea great
                  thankes wee yeeld to thee. </p>
                <p>Another of our saviour Christ: Father I thanke thee for that thou hast heard me. </p>
                <p>This forme of speech is used much with acknowledging the benefites received, and
                  the unworthinesse of the receiver, whereof we have an example in Jacob the
                  Patriarch, where he saith in these words: <cit>
                    <quote>I am not worhty of the least of all thy mercies, and all the truth which
                      thou hast shewwed unto thy servant, for with my staffe came I over this

                </p>
                <p>Sometime it is joyned with a confession of the unablenesse of the receiver to

                  accuse the receiver either of ingratitude, or of forgetfulnesse. </p>

                <p>An example of Job, who being acused &amp; rebuked of his frends of impaciency and

                </p>
                <p>In this forme of speech our Saviour Christ doth many times defend his doings
                  aginst the accusation of his enemies: as, for healing the man with the withered

                </p>
                <p>In like manner he defendeth his Disciples being accused for pulling the eares of
                  corne on the Sabboth day, by alledging the example of David eating the shew bread
                  in his great hunger. Secondly by shewing his authority being Lord of the Sabboth.
                  And thirdly by citing a sentence of Ose, which he thus applyeth: <cit>
                    <quote>If you knew (saith he) what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not

                <p>Another of the Apostle Paul: Shall we continue in sinne, that grace may abound?
                  God forbid. </p>
                <p>An example of the author to herennius. Our auncestors if thy condemned any woman
                  of one offence, they deemed her by plaine judgement to be convicted of many: by
                  what reason? for whom they judge unchast in life, they esteemed also guilty of
                  poysoning: why so? because it must needes be, that she which addicteth her body to
                  unlawful lust doth feare many: who be they? her husband, her parentes, and others
                  to whom she seeth the infamy of her dishonesty doth concerne: what then? it must
                  needes be that by any meanes shee may, shee will indevor their destruction, whom
                  she feareth so much: wherefore? because there is no honest means to hold her back
                  whom the greatnesse of the offence maketh fearfull, intemprancy bold, and womans
                  nature rash. What judged they of her which was condemned of poisoning? Also of
                  necessity unchast of body: wherefore? because nothing might sooner move her to
                  that wickednesse then dishonest love and intemperate lust. Forasmuch as they
                  thought that the body of that woman could not be chast whose mind was corrpt: what
                  did thy not observe the same in men? no: why so? because any desire doth thrust
                  men forward to any one mischief, one desire leadeth women to all mischiefes. </p>
                <p>Another example of the same Author: Our elders did wel provide this law, that it
                  should not be lawfull to put to death any king whom they should take in battaile:
                  why so? because it were against reason and equity to imploy that power which
                  fortune hath given to us, in the punishment of those whom the same fortune had a
                  little before placed in a most high and honorable estate: what for that he brought
                  his army as an enemy? I do forget it: why do you so? because it is the part of a
                  constant and valiant Captaine to esteeme them his enemies which do contend for the
                  victory, and to judge them men which are overcome, to this end, that fortitude may
                  diminish warre, and humanity encrease peace: but would he have done the like if he
                  had won the field? I am perswaded he would not have been so wie: why then dost
                  thou spare him? becuase I have alwaies used to contemne, and not to imitate such

                  those whom he feareth, or ought to reverence, &amp; having somewhat to say that
                  may either touch themselves, or those whom they favour, preventeth the displeasure
                  and offence that might be taken, as by craving pardon afore hand, and by shewing
                  the necessitie of free speech in that behalfe, or by some other like forme of
                  humble submission and modest insinuation. </p>

                <p>An example of Cicero: I speake with great peril, I feare judges after what sort
                  you may take my words, but for my continuall desire that I have to maintaine and
                  augment you dignitie, I pray and beseech you, that if my speech be either bitter
                  or incredible unto you at the first hearing, yet that you would accept it without
                  offence spoken of Marcus Cicero: Neither that you will reject it before I have
                  plainlie declared the whole unto you. </p>
                <p>By this example of Cicero, we may see how this figure ought to be used, by which
                  he made an apt enterance, and ready pathway to his purpose; which was boldly to
                  blame the Senate, &amp; sharply to rebuke their unconstancie, for that they were
                  now about to joyne in peace with Anthony, who a little before was adjudged and
                  taken for their utter and extreme enemy: and now having changed their minds, were
                  purposed to make him their friend. In the beginning he useth a defence or
                  mittigation, saying that hee speaketh with peril, &amp; feareth in what sort or
                  part his words may be taken, notwithstanding he prounuseth that, that which he
                  hath to say, shalbe for the maintenance &amp; honour of the Senate, by which wise
                  &amp; lowly preparation, he obtained their favour to heare him: then next he
                  praieth them not to reject his wordes before he hath declared the whole, how so
                  ever displeasant they may seeme at the first. And finally, that it might please
                  them to take in good part, whatsoever he should expresse and utter, promising that
                  al should be for their profit and advancement, and also protesting that it should
                  proceed from good will and entire affection. </p>

                  is when the speaker leadeth away the mind of his hearer, from the matter
                  propounded or question in hand, which maketh much against him. The way and cunning
                  to do this, is manifold &amp; almost infinite. Cicero when he should have answered
                  to an accusation, in which it was objected that Caelius poysoned Metellus, for as
                  much as it was proved that Caelius had poison prepared in his house: and
                  furthermore that the force of that poison was tried in a servant of his, he
                  digressed by and by to Metellus death, and maketh a suspition that he was poisoned
                  by the mischievous deede of Clodius: he sigheth, weepeth and bewaileth that death,
                  whereby he staieth and appeaseth his adversaries, and causeth them to mourne with
                  him, and to be striken (as it were) with the same wound, and so by his vehement
                  and forcible perswasion turneth the mindes of the Judges from the cogitation of
                  the fact, now and then touching it a little, and slipping from it again. </p>

              <term>Description</term>, <term>Comparison</term> and <term>Collection</term>: these
            be the fower generall partes, wherof the whole body of <term>Amplification</term>,
            consisteth, and are as it were the fower mighty and plentifull streams of copious
            eloquence which are continually fed and filled with ye perpetuall and pleasant springs
            of mans wit: I meane those figures and formes of speech which the reason of man, the
            principall part and power of his minde, hath by long and diligent search found out, to
            the admirable utterance of his knowledge, and glory of his wisedome. Now as the figures
            of the first order have their speciall regard to the placing of words, and their proper
            grace in a musicall proportion, wherein the mind and wit of man even by a naturall
            instinct taketh pleasaure and delight: And also as the figures of the second order do

            whatsoever the heart doth affect or suffer: even so the figures of this the third order

                not so little, or when a word is such and so applyed, as doth amplify the thing it

                those figures may conveniently be divided into fower orders, as aforesaid, that is

                or to be angry, to favour, to desire or to be satisfied, to feare or to hope, to
                envy, to abhorre, to pittie, to rejoyce, to be ashamed, to repent, and finally to be
                subject to the power of his speech whither soever it tendeth. </p>
              <p>The Orator by helpe hereof either renteth all in peeces like the thunder: or else
                by little and little, like the flowing water creepeth by gentle meanes into the

            <div type="commentary"><head>The matter of <term>Amplification</term>.</head>

              <p>Matters which fall into this kind of exornation, ought to be great, excellent good,
                or notorious evill, cruel, horrible, marvellous, pleasant, or pittifull: after which
                may follow and that worthily, desire, hatred, feare, admiration, hope, gladnesse,
                mirth, pittie, weeping, and such like affections. </p>
              <p>The places from whence Orators do fetch these causes be noble and famous
                enterprises, great and worthy vertues, wonderful &amp; strange accidents, wicked and
                horrible factes, as murders, parricides, destructions of Citties, tirannie &amp;
                slaughter, rapes &amp; woredome, perjuries, conspiracies, robberies and briefly what
                soever is commendable, and do merit high praise or abominable, and deserveth
                punishment: whatsoever is very pleasant or very lamentable, whatsoever is thought
                deare and precious, profitable, admirable, detestable, or dangerous, may minister
                matter to <term>Amplification</term>: and finally all such thinges as cannot be
                heard without a great motion of minde: Examples whereof are plentifull and almost
                everywhere to be found in the orations of Tully. He doth amplifie the theftes, the
                sacrileges, the robberies, the lecherous life of Verres, and also his new devised
                paines, and punishments: the drunkennesse, the bold presumptions, the prodigalitie,
                and other such like wicked offences of Antony, the crueltie of Chrysogomus, the
                impudencie of Erutius, the homicides of Capiton, he doth vehemently invey against
                Pilo, vehemently against Clodius, but most vehemently of all against Catiline.
                Contrariwise he doth highly praise and comend the vertues of his frends, as the
                knowledge, quicknesse and happinesse of Pompeius in warlike affaires and martiall
                enterprises: he extolleth to the Cloudes Caesars liberality towards his frends, his
                mercie towards his captives, and magnifieth most marvellously the number of his
                victories. The oration of this Orator are plentifully replenished with these
                exornations, and with many other like vertues of speaking, who excelled all others
                of his time, for by his eloquence he oft cast downe his adversaries from their
                estate and dignitie, oftentimes by his copious speech and vehemencie of pleading, he
                frayed most excellent Orators from their friends defence, by the force of his speech
                he compelled Caesar to pardon Legarius, whom he came most greedily to condemne, and
                made Catiline (a most audacious traitor) dumbe in the Senate, with great vehemency
                and copie, he disputeth much of religion, of duties, of the generall safetie of
                Citizens, of liberty given of the auncestors, of bondage odious to nature, of the
                intollerable evils of Antony, and other enemies of the countrey &amp; commonwealth,
                like to insue: from whence as from a most plentifull fountaine may be taken most

                <p><term>Enumeratio</term>, when the subject is divided into the accidents, the
                  matter into the antecedents, the effect into the causes, and into things annexed
                  and following after the effect. </p>
                <p>1 Of the subject into accidents. </p>
                <p>An example: what may we thinke of man, when we consider the heavy burthen of his
                  miserie, the weaknesse of his patience, the imperfection of his understanding, the
                  conflicts of his counsels, the insatietie of his mind, the brevitie of his life,
                  and the certaintie of his death? </p>
                <p>An example of Job: <cit>

                      distributed, as the time of peace, the time of warre, the tune of plentie, the
                      time of dearth and famine which are the accidentes of time.</quote>

                  </cit>
                </p>
                <p>2 A matter into the antecedents, and meanes by which it is brought to passe. That
                  Cicero repressed teh purposes of Catiline, thus it may be set foorth. The
                  mischievous enterprises of Catiline, who went about the utter destruction of Rome,
                  Marcus Tullius Cicero the Consull, by his prudent foresight did quickly smel out
                  by his singular vigilance sought out, by his high providence found out, and by his
                  marvellous love to the ocmmon wealth shewed out. And then by his incredible
                  eloquence he convicted them, by his grave authoritie repressed them, by his might
                  abolished them, and by his great happinesse quite overthrew them. </p>
                <p>3 The numbring up of the causes, is when we declare not the matter or effect
                  nakedly, but rehearse the occasions and efficients whereby it began, proceeded,
                  and continued, as if one should in making report of warre, shew also the occasion
                  of the first kindeling, what were the causes of debate, who were the motioners of
                  enterprising the same warre, what hope of ech side to get victorie, what boldnesse
                  on both parts in their meeting. </p>
                <p>Examples hereof are easily found in Poets and writers of histories: specially in
                  Livius. </p>
                <p>4 The numbring and rehearsing of effects and consequents, when we do not declare
                  a matter simply, but shew those things which go with it, or follow after it.
                  Anotny was the cause of civill<note place="marg" anchored="false">Cicero.</note>
                  warre, of three slaine armies of Romane people, of the death of many noble
                  Cittizens, of overthrowing the authorie of the Senate, and finally of all evils
                  whatsoever. </p>
                <p>5 Also by this figure, the Orator distributed to particular persons their
                  particular duties to Princes and subjects, maisters and servants, to persons

                  this removing one thing from another, endeth them both by shewing a reason. Cicero
                  for Ligarius. I demaund now, whether you will revenge your owne injuries, or the
                  injuries of the common wealth: if you do revenge the injurie of the common wealth:
                  if you do revenge the injurie of the common wealth: what answere will you make
                  concerning your constancie in that behalfe? If that you do revenge your owne,
                  beware you erre not, which think that Caesar will be angry and retaine displeasure
                  with your enemies, when he hath forgiven his own, not covetousnesse, for the maner
                  of his life doth shew that he was never covetous, neither povertie for he hath
                  great riches. </p>
                <p>Another: Why should I now saie any thing to thy charge, if thou beest good, thou
                  hast not deserved it, but if thou beest naught, thou carest not for it. </p>

                <p><term>Horysmos</term> is a forme of speech by which the Orator declareth the
                  proper pith of some thing, and it is chiefly used, when there is a difference
                  sought for between two words, which by defining, this findeth foorth. </p>
                <p>1 An example: This is not fortitude but temeritie, for fortitude is a contempt of
                  perils by honest reason: temeritie is a foolish enterprise of perils, without
                  respect of vertue. </p>
                <p>2 Cicero for Marcus Marcellus: for neither is this to be counted thy life, which
                  is contained in thy bodie and breath, but that is thy life (O Caesar I say) which
                  shall live and floorish in memorie unto the worldes end, which posteritie shal
                  nourish, which eternitie shall ever behold. </p>
                <p>3 Glorious victorie consisteth not in slaying of poore people, as women,
                  children, and impotent persons, which hunger and famine, wherein resteth neither
                  fortitude, prudence, nor pollicie, but in subduing of couragious Captaines,
                  overcomming of valiant souldiers, and winning of strong and mightie Cities. To
                  this distinction, a lyke answer is made, a glorious victorie consisteth not so
                  much in crueltie as in humanitie, not so much in shedding of blood, as in shewing
                  of mercy. Fire doth consume, &amp; the sword doth devour, but famine by litle and
                  litle maketh tame the most puissant nations and stoutest people of the world. </p>

                <p>By this exornation also a word or an action, is eloquently distinguished in
                  degrees by certaine generall wordes, thus: To powre forth thy curse against thy
                  adversary is malignity, against an innocent crueltie, against thy parent impietie,
                  against God blasphemie. </p>
                <p>Another example: To refute good counsell is folly, to contemne it is wickednesse,
                  to scorne it is madnesse. </p>

                  plaine by a kind of definition, or declaration. By definition, an example: </p>
                <p>There be three things which men do greedily covet, and earnestly follow, riches,
                  pleasures, and honors, riches are the nurces of sinne and iniquitie, pleasures are
                  the daughters of dishonesty, and guides which lead to misery: Honors are mothers
                  and nurces of worldly pompe, and vanitie. </p>
                <p>There are three sorts of men which do dispose of all that a man hath, the Lawyer,
                  the Phisition, and the Divine. The Lawyer disposeth of his goods, the Phisition of
                  his bodie, and the divine of his soule. </p>

              <p><term>Descriptio</term> is a generall name of many and sundry kindes of
                descriptions, and a description is when the Orator by a diligent gatherin together
                of circumstances, and by a fit and naturall application of them, doth expresse and
                set forth a thing so plainly and lively, that it seemeth rather painted in tables,
                then declared with words, and the mind of the hearer therby so drawen to an earnest
                and stedfast contemplation of the thing described, that he rather thinketh he seeth
                it then heareth it. By this exornation the Orator imitateth the cunning painter
                which doth not onely draw the true proportion of thines, but also bestoweth naturall
                colours in their proper places, whereby he compoundeth as it were complexion with
                substance and life with countenance: for hence it is, that by true proportion and
                due coloure, cunning and curious Images are made so like to the persons which they
                present, that they do not onely make a likely shew of life, but also by outward
                countenance of the inward spirite and affection. </p>
              <p>So great and singular is that science, that there is no creature under heaven, no
                action, no passion, no frame in art, nor countenance in man, whose true proportion
                and externall forme is not finely counterfaited, and wonderfully imitated. Trees and
                plaints in their colours, flowers in their bewty, beastes &amp; birdes in their
                natures, men in their countenances and habite, some grave, some smiling, some angry,
                some weeping, some yong, some old, some asleepe, some dead, also in their degrees,
                as Princes and subjects, magistrates and prisoners, riche men and beggers, men of
                artes and occupations, ladies, gentlewomen, maidens, old women, captains, souldiers,
                finally al kind of persons in their countenance, gesture and apparell: even so doth
                the Orator by his art and his speech describe and set forth to the contemplation of
                mans mind, any person, deede, thing, place or time, so truly by circumstance, that
                the hearer shall thinke that he doth plainly behold the matter described. Now under
                the generall name of <term>Description</term>, I do not only reckon speciall kindes
                of description, but also all other figures, which do chiefly respect circumstances

                <p><term>Prosographia</term> is a forme of speech by which as well the very person
                  of a man as of a fained, is by his form, stature, maners, studies, doings,
                  affections, and such other circumstances serving to the purpose so described, that
                  it may appeare a plaine and lively picture painted in tables, and set before the
                  eies of the hearer. The circumstances by which such descriptions be made are many,
                  ye tthe most principal and most usuall are these, parentage, nation, countrey,
                  kind, age, education, discipline, habite of body, fortune, condition, nature of
                  mind, studie, former deedes, apparell, &amp; c. By these and such like
                  circumstances the whole man is lively painted and portraited as wel his mind as
                  his body, and as aswel his qualities as his quantity: as for example, we may by
                  the circumstances of age describe an old man<note place="marg" anchored="false"

                    <quote>with crooked limmes, and trembling jointes, his head white, his eies
                      hollow, his sight dimmes, his hearing thicke, his handes shaking, his legges
                      bowing, his colour pale, his skin wrinkled, weake of memory childish yet
                      covetous, suspicious, testy, greedy of newes, credulous, misliking of the
                      present world, and praising the former times</quote>
                    <bibl>Eccles. 12.</bibl>
                  </cit>: also by this form great persons are described, as emperours, princes,
                  bishops, noble captains, holy patriarks, grave judges, &amp; great authors. By
                  this figure Cicero painteth out Ebucius, and against Verres, he describeth
                  Theomastus, in his oration for Roscius, Chrisogomus, and in his oration for<note
                    place="marg" anchored="false">Action.</note> Quintius he painteth out Nevius
                  with Quintius by an <term>Antithesis</term>. The desciption of fained persons doth
                  properly belong to poets, &amp; is seldom or never used of orators: by this figure
                  diverse historiographers do most lively describe noble captains, Kinges &amp;
                  Emperours to looke upon. </p>

                  person, and bring it in bitterly complaining how cruelly she is oppressed and how
                  litle esteemed, how often outfaced, and how much abhorred, how many be her
                  enemies, how few her frends, how she wandreth hither and thither without
                  intertainment, and remaineth without habitation, he may faine her complaing

                  also he may cause her to accuse flatterie and detraction, theft, violence, and
                  fraude, and to make a most true and long complaint, as well against persons that

                  to him, it is called <term>Sermocinatio</term> as in this example of Ose. </p>

                  maner of speech may become some manner of persons, which is unseemely for others:
                  the speech of children is not so well seasoned with reason as of ye elder sort, a

                  civil as citizens, Judges are grave in giving their opinions, &amp; definitive
                  sentences, ruffins contrariwise are rash, running headlong upon mischiefe, ye
                  poore man speaketh submissively, the rich man more audaciously, the victor (for ye
                  most part) speaketh much with insulting and much in deriding, ye vanquished person
                  fearfully &amp; pleasingly which is well observed of poets: Dauus speaketh after
                  one sort, and Simo after another. Thraso useth boasting &amp; bragging, Gnato
                  flattering, but Chremes faithful &amp; sober talke, poets &amp; orators have
                  alwaies been diligent in observing a comelinesse: Cicero in this behalfe was

                  person whom he fained to speake, whether he were his adversary or his friend: he
                  brought in Milo speaking valiently, Antony arrogantly, Nevius wickedly, Erutrius

                  (saith Fabius) comprehended all in a summe, but if thou wilt open and set abroad
                  all things, and everie particuler effect included within that summe, there shall

                  houses falling downe, a confused sound of many thinges, and wofull cries, some
                  flying with great perill, other imbracing their frends, and bidding them farewell
                  for ever, infants scriking, women most bitterly weeping, olde men reserved by most
                  unhappy destinie to see that day, the spoiling of temporall, and prophaning of
                  hallowed things, the running forth of them that carrie away the spoiles, and the
                  submission of them that entreat for their owne goods, every captive led chained
                  before his taker, the mother rastling to retaine her sucking babe, and wheresoever
                  great wealth is, there is also great fighting and contention among the spoilers
                  themselves: now albeit this word Destruction might well comprise all these

                  the same, for he doth not onely say, the cittie was taken, tmeples overthrowen,
                  houses burned, everie thing spoiled, but also how the cittie was taken, temples,
                  houses and buildings destroied, what perished else, what lamentation, what
                  weeping, how horrible the slaughter was, the ravishing of Virgins, the shedding of

            <div type="commentary" subtype="figure" n="Pathopeia"><head><term>Pathopeia</term>.</head>

              

                <p><term>Pathopeia</term>, is a forme of speech by which the Orator moveth the minds
                  of his hearers to some vehemency of affection, as of indignation, feare, envy,
                  hatred, hope, gladnesse or sorrow: of this there be two kindes. </p>
                <p>The first is when the Orator being moved himselfe with anie of these affections
                  (sorrow excepted) doth bend &amp; apply his speech to stir his hearers to the
                  same: and this kinde is called <term>Imagination</term>, to which diverse vehement
                  figures do belong, as <term>Exclamatio</term>, <term>Obteslatio</term>,
                    <term>Imprecatio</term>, <term>Optatio</term>, <term>Exuscitatio</term>,
                    <term>Interrogatio</term>, and such like. And to move mirth, formes of speech
                  serving to that purpose, as <term>Asteismus</term>, and others of that kinde. Now
                  as I sayd before, matters that fall into this figure ought to be great, cruell,
                  horrible, odious, pleasant, or marvellous, for the greater ye caue is, the sooner
                  the affections of the hearers are moved. Examples hereof are common in Tragedies,
                  but of mirth and laughter in Comodies. </p>
                <p>2 The other kind of <term>Pathopeia</term>, is when the Orator by declaring some
                  lamentable cause, moveth his hearers to pitie and compassion, to shew maerc, and
                  to pardon offences. To move compassion, lamentable histories are oftentimes used,
                  and likewise the lively descriptions of wofull sufferings, and pitiful miseries,
                  and how they may be artificially expressed. Poets complaints may give apt
                  examples. </p>
                <p>To pardon offences the perorations of Cicero are good presidents. A serious and
                  deepe affection in the Orator is a mightie furtherance and helpe to this figure,
                  as when he is zealous, and deeply touched himselfe with any of those vehement
                  affections, but specially if he be inwardly moved with a pitifull affection, he
                  moveth his hearers to the same compassion and pitie, by his passionate
                  pronunctiation. For true it is, that the apt bending of ye voice to the qualitie
                  and nature of the cause, is not only a necessary dutie in an Orator, but also an
                  excellent ornament. </p>
              
              <div type="commentary"><head>The use of this figure.</head>

                <p>This figure pertaineth properly to move affections, which is a principall and
                  singular vertue of eloquution. </p>
              </div>
              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                <p>In the use of this figure there are many and necessary points to be observed.
                  First that the causes themselves may be suficient to move the mindes of the
                  hearers to affections and passions, for it must be effectual matter, and not bare
                  words that may worke so great effects in prudent hearers. </p>
                <p>Secondly, that there be a discreet observation of necessarie circumstances, as in
                  what causes, what affections are to be moved, for in divine Orations, and Sermons,
                  to move laughter doth much diminish and oppose the modestie of so grave an action,
                  and so serious a cause. </p>
                <p>Secondly when and where, (that is) the time and place had need to be diligently
                  observed, lest through want of discretion such affections be moved as are most
                  unfit for the time, or unmeete for the place, as mourning at marriages and joyfull
                  meetings: and contrariwise mirth at funerals &amp; houses of mourning, are both
                  repugnant to nature and contrary to custome. </p>

                <p>Thirdly, it is verie needfull to shunne the untimely, and too hastie chaunge of
                  affections, for first to move pittie or weeping, and then presently to turne
                  weeping, into laughter or contrariwise, wheweth the follie to be great, and maketh
                  the action absurd. </p>
                <p>Fourthly it is the part of a prudent Orator to observe a measure in moving
                  affections, lest he kindle that which he is not able to quench. </p>
                <p>Fiftly, fained matter, fond gesture, and counterfait pronountiation ought to be
                  hated and avoyded. </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div type="commentary" subtype="figure" n="Icon"><head><term>Icon</term>.</head>

              

                <p><term>Icon</term>, is a forme of speech which painteth out the image of a person
                  or thing, by comparing forme with forme, qualitie with qualitie, and one likenesse
                  with another. </p>
                <p>I may by this figure paint out a favenous and venomous person in this forme and
                  manner: Even as a cressed Dragon which with burning eyes, sharpe teeth, crooked
                  clawes, gaping mouth, runneth hither and thither, and looketh everie where whom he
                  may finde to spit his poyson uppon, whom he may catch in his mouth, crash in
                  sunder with his teeth, venome with his tongue and rent in peeces with his pawes. </p>
                <p>Saint Barnard painteth the cart of covetousnesse in this maner:<note place="marg"
                    anchored="false">Barnard super Cantie.</note> The cart of covetousnesse (saith

                <p><note place="marg" anchored="false">1. To praise.</note>To praise thus: O
                  wonderfull clemencie, O most holy discipline. Hence it is, that we say: Gracious

                  substantive, &amp; that most elegantly, as in this example of Tertullian: We pray

                  their court safe, their armies strong, their counsellers trustie, their people
                  good, the whole world quiet, and whatsoever else that subject of Prince do desire

                <p>Many Epithets are often joyned to one Substantive, as for example: The judgements

                  Evil counsellers, unnatural parents, disobedient children, ignorant teachers,

                  that ye Epithets be not unproperly or perversely<note place="marg"
                    anchored="false">1. Unproperly or perversely applied.</note> applied, as to say:
                  A valiant Phisitian, a reverend labourer, a coragious Counseller, which is a forme
                  of speech very unproper and also very absurd. </p>

                <p><term>Periphrasis</term>, is a forme of speech wherby that which might be said
                  with one word, or at the least with verie few, is declared and expounded with
                  many, and that sundrie waies. </p>
                <p>First by explication of the name which the Grecians do call
                    <term>Etimologia</term>: As when for this word Philosopher, we say a man
                  studious of wisedome, for Parasite a flatter for gaines sake: for Christian a
                  worshipper of Christ. </p>
                <p>Secondly by Annotation: that is, when by certaine markes or tokens we describe
                  any thing, as understanding what anger is, we say it is a vehement heat of the
                  mind, which bringeth palenesse to the countenance, burning to the eyes, &amp;
                  trembling to the parts of the bodie. </p>

                <p>Thirdly by definition: For man, a living creature endued with reason, for a
                  tyrant, an oppresor of the lawes and liberties of the common wealth. </p>

                <p><note place="marg" anchored="false">1. Necessitie.</note>There be three causes to

                    Perscuitie.</note>proper word. The second is desire of copie and facilitie, by

                    <quote>he hath not eaten his meate along, that he hath not seene any man perish
                      for want of clothing, or any poore for lacke of covering.</quote>

                  is not the wisest man in the world, or he is none of the wisest, that is, he is
                  not wise at all: this and such like formes of speaking are used for modesties

                <p>Another example, Cicero for Milo: Now truely the fortune of the Romane people

                <p>Another: What diddest thou covet? What didest thou wish? what diddest thou
                  desire? The other wich declareth one thing with diverse members, divers causes,

                  many and great causes, such a wickednesse cannot bee committed, and contendeth
                  that it cannot fall but upon a mischievous and most lewd men: after this he
                  demaundeth of Erutius the cause why Roscius should slay his father, which place
                  because it was strongest in Roscius defence, he tarieth long in it, and very often
                  maketh his returne thither, he often demaundeth the causes of so great and
                  horrible wickednesse, of so shameful a deed, he often amplifieth the greatnesse of
                  the fact, and that which is great indeede, he maketh by his eloquence and

                <p><term>Digressio</term> is the handling of some matter going out from order, but
                  yet for profit of some pertinent cause, we may digresse for the cause of praising,
                  dispraising, delighting or preparing. <term>Digressons</term> are taken either
                  from the declaration of deeds, the descriptions of persons, places and times, the
                  reporting of Apollogies and similltudes, &amp; likewise from common places. </p>
              

              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                <p>There be diverse observations concerning <term>digression</term> neccessary to be
                  remembred. 1. The first is to see som cause why we should digresse, that is, that
                  the same <term>digression</term> may some maner of way profit comend, &amp;
                  garnish the cause that we have in hand, for the <term>digression</term> ought in
                  some respect to pertaine &amp; agree to those matters which we handle, and not to
                  be strange or far distant from ye purpose. 2. The second is to provide a forehand
                  a perfect &amp; readie way to goe forth aptly, and making no long stay out,
                  likewise to foresee a fit entrance for our returne. </p>

                <p>3 The third is, to take good heede that we do not darken our main cause and
                  principall matter: we darken it if we goe forth abruptly, tarie too long abroad,
                  tell thinges strange, distant, or disagreeing to the purpose, or returne into the
                  cause overthwartly. </p>

                <p>1. Comparison of like thinges, as Camillus by his vertue did drive away the
                  Barbarians and set up againe the Romane Empire, being sore opprest, and almost
                  brought to utter destructions: even so Laurentius Valla restored the Latine tongue
                  to the former puritie, which through the ignorance of the Barbarians was
                  corrupted, suppressed, and almost quite extinct: As James and Jambres withstood
                  Moses, so do these resist the truth, men of corrupt mindes reprobate concerning

                  Marcellus resstored to the Syracusans his enemies their ornaments: Verres tooke

                  the glorie and greatnesse of vertue. As in daungerous sayling the helme is not
                  committed to him that is richest or noblest in birth, but to him that hath the
                  best knowledge in guiding the ship: even so is it requisite and behovefull not to

                  that either in words that be contrarie, or in contrarie sentences. </p>
                <p>1 In contrary words: He is gone but yet by a gainfull remove, from painfull
                  labour to quiet rest, from unquiet desires to happie contentment, from sorrow to
                  joy, and from transitory time to immortalitie. </p>
                <p>2 An example of Cicero: And may you then preferre the unknowne before the knowne,
                  the wicked before the just, strangers before neighbours, the covetous before the
                  contented, hirelings before free helpers, the prophane before the religious, the

                <p>3 So well sighted were the eyes of his minde, that by them he saw life in death,

                <p>4 In contrary sentences: Art thou rich? then robbe not the poore: if thou beest
                  strong, tread not the weake under thy feete: if wise, beguile not the simple: if
                  publike by authoritie, oppresse not him that is private. </p>
                <p>Another: What is more odious then labour to the idle, fasting to the glutton,

                  c. </p>

                <p>1. Parentage: Thou ar of a noble blood, and hast thou made thy selfe a companion
                  of most lewd men. </p>
                <p>2. Nation: art not thou worthie of blame being an Englishman borne to despise the
                  practice of shooting, knowing that it hath been of long time the principall cause
                  of English glory? </p>
                <p>3. Countrey: To be borne in Crete and to hate the vice of lying is praise worthy.
                  To be borne in Asia among Turkes and to favoure and imbrace Christian religion,
                  amplifieth the vertue of that man. </p>

                  unseemely in women, and woman kind. </p>
                <p>5. Age: Lying, lightnesse and lust are three evils intollerable in youth, how
                  much more in gray heads and old age? </p>
                <p>6. Education: To be well brought up, and vertuously trained in youth, and after
                  to digresse and become wicked as did Nero, amplifieth the fault and increaseth the
                  shame. </p>

                  divinitie to teach errors and maintaine heresies, a Phisition to destroy life by
                  the abuse of Phisicke, a Captaine to forsake his Prince, and take part with the
                  enemie: all these are great offences in any sort of men, but yet far greater, when
                  the profession and the transgression be compared together. </p>
                <p>8. Habite of bodie: God hath indued thee with a bewtifull fairnesse, and why dost
                  thou live in so foule manner, and blemish that which he hath bewtified? </p>
                <p>Thou hast a lustie and strong bodie, art thou not ashamed to beg thy bread? </p>

                <p>9. Condition: Being a servant and to strike his maister, is he not worthy to be
                  punished? How dare you being a private person resist your magistrate? a rich man
                  to steale, a poore man to be proud, are offences much encreased when their
                  condition or estate is considered. </p>
                <p>10. The nature of the mind: God hath given you a valiant heart, and shall
                  carefull thoughts overcome you? you have had alwaies a constant mind, and shall
                  trifles quench your old frendship? </p>
                <p>11. Studie: You studie the law which is the maintenance of right, with what face
                  or conscience can you offer this wrong? </p>
                <p>12. Foredeedes: When a man hath in his youth and former part of his time been
                  vertuous, well geven, liberall and pittifull, valiant and hardie, and now to fall
                  from all vertue to all vice, to become hard, cruell, cowardly, slouthfull and
                  carelesse, amplifieth greatly these crimes by which those excellent vertues are
                  oppressed. </p>
                <p>13. You counselled them to take this ungracious enterprise in hand, and therefore

                <p>14. Name: Is thy name Salomon, and hast no more wisedome? doest thou feare to be

                  wanton behaviour is offensive to good men, and cursed before God. To abuse the
                  tune of peace with tumults and sedition, is an heinous offence. </p>

                  his brother, doth take away all excuse of ignorance and pretence of infirmitie. </p>

                <p><term>Paramologia</term>, of some called <term>Paralogia</term>, it is when the
                  speaker granteth many things to his adversary worthie of commendation, and at the
                  length bringeth in some notable crime, which oppresseth and quencheth all that was
                  granted before. Cicero for Flaccus: Notwithstanding this I say concerning the
                  whole nation of the Greekes, I grant unto them learning, I grant unto them the
                  knowledge of many Artes, I take not from them the comely grace of speech, fine
                  wittes, singular eloquence. And futhermore, if they challenge unto themselves any
                  other thing, I will not deny it them, yet religion and faith that nation never
                  favoured, what vertue, what authoritie, what waight there is of all this matter,
                  they know not. </p>
                <p>Also it is by this gifure when the speaker in his conclusion bringeth in that
                  whcih was not looked for, or that which is contrary, or at least farre distant
                  from the premises. As for example, Salomon rehearseth the partes of his felicitie,
                  he mentioneth his riches, possessions, sumptuous buildings &amp; pleasures: but
                  suddenly he concludeth that all this is but vanitie and vexation of spirit. This
                  conclusion commeth unlooked for, and verie unlike to have ensued such premises,
                  the expectation tendeth rather to heare what felicitie followed all this wealth
                  and great possession: and not what vanitie or vexation of sprit. </p>

                <p>The like example of this manner of speaking is in the 21. of Job, where he first
                  describeth the prosperitie of the wicked, and then concludeth that suddenly they
                  go downe to the grave. </p>

                  of the law, I will now passe to the sweet promises of the Gospell. </p>

                  withstanding he did extenuate the fault with gentle words, and as much as he could
                  pacified the judges, who were vehemently kindled against him, he said that those
                  things were partly the vices of times rather then of the man, he contended that
                  soem thing ought to be yelded to age, he opposeth against the offence a hope of
                  future regard and diligence. And also as a remedie against new sprung envy, by the
                  acts and enterprises which now Caelius tooke upon him, he applieth his own

                  far distant: the sensible hearing and understanding wherof requireth a diligent
                  listning and attention, which a carlesse mind doth not esteeme, nor a dul sense
                  able to comprehend. Secondly, it is necessary to provide that this forme of speech
                  fall not into the fault of deep obscuritie, by too dark a shadow, as by the
                  strangenesse of the word, or unlikenesse of the thing, or unaptnesse of the

                  speech to amplifie any great or excellent matter. For by this figure the Orator

                  so primly that the hearer must be faine to seeke out the meaning, either by
                  sharpnesse of wit, or long consideration. Hortentius said, that he was never made
                  friends with his mother and his sister: meaning that there was never any debate or
                  contention between them. </p>
                <p>Quintilian in his 8 booke and 5. chapter bringeth in an example of a certaine

                  Cicero rebounded the same accusation againe to Antony, saing: Thou Marcus Antony,

                  against thy countrey. </p>

                  told with no more words then those that be necessaarie: or when the Orator by
                  brevitie cutteth off the expectation of the hearers. </p>
                <p>An example: Pompeius prepared for war in winter, began it in the spring, and
                  furnished it in sommer. </p>
                <p>Another: As he passed by, he tooke Lemnum: then he left a garison at Tharsus:
                  after that he got a cittie in Bithinia, driven from thence into Hespontus,
                  straight way wan Abidus. Cicero for Manlius: How speedilie Pompeius being Captain
                  failed with vehemencie of war, who entred into Cilicia, spied out Africa from
                  thence came with his Navie into Sardinia. The like brevitie Simo useth in Terence:
                  The corps (saith he) goeth before, we follow after, we come to the grave, it is
                  put into the fire, a lamentation is made. </p>
              
              <div type="commentary"><head>The use of this figure.</head>

                <p>Brevitie comprehended in few words maketh a quick dispatch of many thinges,
                  wherefore it is to be used either when matters need no long speech, or when time
                  requireth speed, or the hearers such as few wordes may instruct. </p>

                <p>In coveting brevitie, it is necessarie to avoide extremitie, for too much hast
                  leaveth the Oration manie times obscure and unperfect, as may be seene in their
                  workes which did too much affect this forme whereby they fell into obscuritie.

                <p><term>Procatalepsis</term> is a forme of speech by which the Orator perceiving
                  aforehand what might be objected against him, and hurt him, doth confute it before
                  it be spoken, or thus: when the Orator putteth forth the same objection against
                  himselfe, which he doth thinke his adversarie would, and then refelleth it by a
                  reason, whereby he doth providently prevent him. Cicero: as if some Judge or
                  commiissioner might say unto me, thou mightest have contended with a lighter
                  action, thou mightest have come to thy right by a more easie and profitable way:
                  wherefore either change thine action, or resist me not as Judge: or if he do
                  prescribe after what sort I ought to sue for my right, to which objection he
                  maketh this answere. Notwithstanding he seemeth either more fearfull then is
                  reason a Judge should be: or else he dareth not judge that which is committed to
                  him. Likewise against Verres, Cicero saith, that he knoweth some men will marvell,
                  seeing so many yeares he defended many, and hurt none, he doth now come to accuse
                  Verres, then he doth shew them that this accusation against Verres is a defence of
                  their fellowes. </p>

                  familiar evill, doth not onely appeare, but also opresse, before thou shalt be
                  able to foresee and espie it. Cicero for Archia: Looke what wit or eloquence I

                  be doen or not done, one reason is left which the Orator standeth unto &amp;
                  concludeth upon, and the other are taken away, thus: Seeing this ground was mine,
                  thou must needes shew, that either thou diddest possesse it being void, or made it
                  thine by use, or bought it, or else that it came to thee by heritage: Thou
                  couldest not possesse it voide when I was in possession: also thou canst not make
                  it thine by use: Thou hast not to shew that thou diddest buy it, it could not come
                  to thee by inheritance, and I alive: it followeth then that thou wouldest put me
                  from mine owne ground, before I be dead. </p>

                <p>Another example: Knowing that almightie God hath in his hand all thinges that we

                  most strong and mightie: nor get any thing from him by fraud, for he is most wise
                  and provident: if we challenge any thing of him by law, he will prove that he
                  oweth us nothing, wherefore it followeth that either he must give them, or else we

                <p><term>Paradigma</term> is the same which the Latines called
                  <term>Exemplum</term>, and we in English an example, and in Rhetoricke it is
                  called the rehearsall of a deede or saying past and applying of it to our purpose,
                  whereof there be two kindes, the one true which is taken from Chronicles &amp;
                  Histories of credit, and it is of great force to moove, perswade, and enflame men
                  with the love of vertue, and also most mightie to deterre and disswade them from
                  vice: It is also used not onely to confirme matters, but even to augment, enrich,
                  bewtifie, and garnish them with much comelinesse. </p>

                <p>Examples which are usually applied in these respects, be either like, unlike, or
                  contrarie, and therefore they are used commonly in a comparative forme, and being
                  aptly compared, and fitly applied, they present to the view and contemplation of
                  our minde, the true of lively Image of time past, for by them it is that we know
                  and see what was done long before our birth, not onely at home, but also in
                  countries far distant from us, for by histories and memorials of deedes done and
                  saying uttered, which are the fountaines from whence we take our examples: we
                  behold ancient deedes and sayings of antiquitie, not as past but as present,
                  Princes, Patriarchs, Prophets, tirants wise men and fooles, holie and wicked, not
                  as dead, but as living, ruling, teaching, doing or speaking, everie one following
                  the inclination of his will, either directed by godly wisedome, or seduced by
                  ignorance, and malice. </p>
                <p>These are they whom wee diligently looke uppon with the eies of our mindes, and
                  also deepely considering both what they were, what they did, what they received,
                  and what they suffered: if they were Kinges how they ruled and governed, if
                  Patriarches how they lived, if wisemen what they said, if fooles, what they
                  committed, if godly what they reaped, and also if wicked, how and in what manner
                  they were punished, whereby wee do plainly appeareth, that there is a most just
                  justice in GOD, by whose wisedome, love, favour and mercie good men are protected,
                  advanced, and made happie: and contrariwise, the evill and wicked by his judgement
                  and power are justly punished. </p>
                <p>These and other such like frutes we reape by the benefit of examples, and
                  therefore their use in doctrine is to be greatly commended, so be it, that they be
                  aptly applyed and truely expressed, for they instruct plainly, move mightily,
                  &amp; perswade effectually. Finallie, their use is generall, for they are in their
                  natures and severall properties apt to enrich, garnish, confirme and amplifie any
                  matter or cause be it never so great, so grave, or so excellent. Thus much for the
                  use and commendation of examples. </p>
              

              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                <p>In the use of examples there are diverse and necessarie observations to be
                  diligently regarded. </p>
                <p>First, that a good example be not ill applied, as to a false purpose and wrong
                  end. </p>
                <p>Secondly, that we make not publicke examples of private actions. </p>
                <p>Thirdly, that we alledge not an ill example of a good man to confirm sin, as to
                  alledge the bigamie of Jacob, the adulterie of David, and the crimes of other holy
                  men to confirme the like sinnes. </p>
                <p>Fourthly, that we confirme not holy Scriptures by prophane examples. </p>
                <p>Fiftly, that we use not reverend examples unreverently, nor such as be grave in
                  light matters, nor contrariwise light and wanton examples in reverend, and grave
                  causes. </p>
                <p>Sixtly, the extraordinary examples of extraordinarie persons are not to commended
                  to imitation. </p>
                <p>The other kind of example is fained by Poets and inventors of fables for
                  delecations sake, &amp; those fained examples are taken from Poets inventions, and
                  from the devises of Apollogies, and fables attributed to brute creatures, as to
                  beastes, birds, fishes, bees, antes, and creeping wormes, also to trees, hearbs,
                  fountains, meadowes, mountaines and vallies, in like maner to the Sunne, Moone,
                  and Starres. </p>

                <p>This kinde bringeth a marvellous delectation to the hearers, but especially to
                  the simpler sort, yet being wittilie invented, and aptly applied, they are not
                  onely allowed of wise men, but also are much commended: the use whereof ought to
                  be verie rare, namely in great and grave causes. </p>
              </div>
              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                <p>Fained examples and Apologies, ought to be used verie seldome, and then not
                  without some fit occasion. </p>
                <p>Secondly, regard ought to be had, that they be not alledged in the forme and
                  countenance of true histories, whereby the truth is violated, and the simple and
                  silly hearer seduced. </p>
                <p>Thirdly, that they be not applied in the stead and place of true examples, to
                  confirme grave and serious causes. </p>
                <p>Fourthly, it is necessarie that discretion be used in their choice, that they be
                  not unfit, foolish, unchast, or any way undecent, all which are in wisedome and
                  vertue to be avoided. </p>

                <p><term>Gnome</term>, otherwise called <term>Sententia</term>, is a saying
                  pertaining to the maners and common practises of men, which declareth by an apt
                  brevitie, what in this our life ought to be done, or left undone. First it is to
                  to observed, that everie sentence is not a figure, but that onely which is
                  notable, worthie of memory, and approved by the judgement and consent of all men,
                  which being such a one, maketh by the excellency therof the Oration not onely
                  beautifull and comely, but also grave, puissant, and full of majestie, whereof
                  there be sundry kindes. </p>
                <p>The first a Sentence universall, which conteineth no certaine person or thing: As
                  evill gotten goods are evill spent: evill will never said well: envy is a
                  punishment in it selfe. </p>
                <p>The second is a single sentence, as, a Citie in sedition cannot be safe, the
                  contented man is verie rich, neccessitie hath no law. </p>
                <p>The third is a double sentence: Flattery getteth friendship, and truth hatred:
                  And old sore is soone hurt, and a testie man soone angrie. </p>
                <p>In all worldly matter something ever lacketh, and nothing long endureth. </p>
                <p>The beginning of everie action is easilie seene, but the sequele is uncertaine. </p>
                <p>The fourth is a sentence without shewing a reason: Yoong men ought to reverence
                  their elders: Silence doth well beseeme women kinde. The hastie man never wanteth
                  wo. </p>
                <p>The fifth, a sentence rendering a reason: He that doth evill, hateth the light,
                  lest his deeds should be repoved. </p>
                <p>It is good to live so, that the rehearsall of our lives may not make us ashamed. </p>
                <p>Cast not too much away with thy hands, lest thou be forced to seeke it with thy
                  feets. </p>
                <p>The first, is a sentence consisting of contraries: By concord small thinges
                  encrease, by discord great riches are soone consumed. </p>
                <p>A guiltie conscience is alwaies afraid but he that hath done no evil liveth in
                  quiet. Better is a messe of pottage with love, then a fat oxe with evill will.
                  Salomon is much delighted with this kinde of sentence: for many of his proverbes
                  be compounded of contrary sentences </p>
                <p>The seventh, is a sentence of diverse things, as: Death is not to be feared, but
                  the way and passage to death. </p>
                <p>Error and repentance, are the companions of rashnesse. </p>
                <p>The eighth, a sentence shewing what doth happen in life, as: Pride goeth before,
                  and shame commeth after. Prodigalitie is the mother of povertie. To day a king, to
                  morrow dead: Life and death are in the hands of the toong, mans nature is covetous
                  of newes, we court after things forbidden, and loath those which are commanded. </p>
                <p>The ninth is a pure sentence, not mixt with any figure, as: It is good to be
                  merry and wise. He is happie which taketh warning by other mens harmes. </p>
                <p>The covetous man wanteth as well that which he had, as that which he hath not. </p>
                <p>The tenth, is a sentence of equitie: Do as thou wouldst be done to. He that is
                  mercilesse shall of mercy misse. </p>
                <p>The eleventh is a figured sentence, whereof there be as many kindes, as there by
                  figures: If it be figured, it beareth the name of the figure wherewith it is
                  joyned. </p>
              
              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                <p>Now in a sentence heede must be taken, that it be not false, strange, too long,
                  or light, without pith or importance. Secondly, that they be not too oft used, and
                  too thin sprinkeled in our speech, for that which is lawfull for Philosophers, is
                  not granted to Orators, because Orators are the handlers of matters, and
                  Philosophers the instructers of life. </p>
              </div>
              <div type="commentary"><head>The use of this figure.</head>

                <p>The use of sentences is marvellous great in morall Philosophie, and also verie
                  profitable, and pleasant in the Art of Rhetoricke: yet are sentences verie
                  sparingly sprinkeled in the Orations of the most eloquent Orators, and that onely
                  in consideration of their singular beautie and brightnesse: for excellent
                  sentences ought to be esteemed as precious pearles and costly jewels in princely
                  vestures, and as the most glorious lightes in the firmament: all which as they are
                  most excellent in beautie and glorie, so are they most rare by creation and
                  nature. </p>

                <p><term>Epexegesis</term>, is an added interpretation: that is, when the Orator
                  doth interprete a word or sentence going before by another word or sentence
                  comming after in this manner: <cit>
                    <quote>When shall be opened the rightuous judgement of God, which will reward

              <div type="commentary"><head>The use of this figure.</head>

                <p>This figure is evermore used when the speaker is desirous to make his meaning
                  most plaine &amp; manifest, supposing it needful for the better explanation
                  therof, to adde a lightsom enterpretation, whereby darke senses are well declared,
                  and the hearer well instructed. </p>
              </div>

              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                <p>There be two most needfull observations herein to be regarded, the one, that the
                  interpretation be a true declaration of the sense, and in no part false, the
                  other, that it may give light, and manifest the word or sentence which it
                  expoundeth, and not obscure it, as some enterpreters now and then do, who through
                  ignorance and want of art, make their interpretations darker then the text,
                  whereby it commeth to passe, that there is called a most darke eclips of bright
                  doctrine, through the interposition of ignorance, which is well resembled in a
                  sore eye, which being tormented and darkened with a pin and a webbe, causeth the
                  other also to become dimme and halfe blinde. </p>

                  your accuser. Cicero against Catiline: And because the decree of the Senate is not
                  yet written, I will shew you as much thereof as I can call to remembrance. Also,
                  before I begin to speake of the common wealth, I will complaine a litle of the
                  injuries yesterday done by Anthony. </p>
              
              <div type="commentary"><head>The use of this figure.</head>

                <p>This figure doth much beautifie the Oration, so that it it be apt and well
                  applied. Now in a proposition there are three things to be considered. </p>
                <p>First that it absolutely containeth whatsoever pertaineth to the cause. </p>
                <p>Secondly that it be well divided. </p>
                <p>Lastly, that it be disposed in an order, most meete for the same cause: for by
                  this meanes the Oration shall not be confounded, with too great an heape of
                  matters, while the hearer hath some certaine thing whereupon he may occupie his
                  minde, both what to remember and what to expect. And likewise the speaker shall
                  not need to doubt which way to go, when the matter is plaine before his face. </p>

                <p><term>Expolitio</term>, when we abide still in one place, and yet seeme to speake
                  divese things, many times repeating one sentence but yet with other words,
                  sentences, exornations, and figures: it differeth saith Malancton, from
                    <term>Smonunia</term>, forasmuch as that repeateth a sentence or thing onely
                  with changed words: but this both with like wordes, lik esentences, and like
                  things, having also many exornations to the garnishing thereof. Cornificius
                  teacheth that of this figure, there be two kindes, the one when we rehearse againe
                  the verie same thing, but not after the same manner, for there is nothing more
                  wearisome, and that may sooner bring satietie and irksomenesse to the hearer, then
                    <term>Tautologia</term>, which is a wearisome repetition of all<note
                    place="marg" anchored="false">Tautolgoia, what it is.</note> one word. But
                  tarrying still in one place, we do varie one thing or sentence diverse maner of
                  waies, and entreat of it with sundry fashions of speech. This first kind is three
                  maner of waies waried. </p>
                <p>The first by shift and chaunge of words, which is called <term>Sinonimia</term>,
                  whereof hath bene said. </p>
                <p>Secondly by altering of pronounciation, that is to say, when the Orator doth
                  occupie or repeat the same wordes and sentences with a certaine alteration and
                  chaunge of his voice and gesture. Sextus Roscius is convicted that he slew his
                  father. Now this is said with a plaine pronunciation: Did Sextus Roscius slay his
                  father? with an interrogation, which is full of marvelling: and likewise that
                  which the Orator hath uttered in hot and vehement speech, he may repeat again with
                  coole and quiet words. </p>
                <p>Thirdly by alteration of the handling or entreating, as when the Orator conveyeth
                  his speech either to <term>Prosopopeia</term>, <term>Sermocinatio</term>,
                    <term>Exusciatio</term>, or to any other such like figure. Cicero when he had
                  reckened up many mischievous deedes of Catiline, and many of his wicked doinges
                  practiced against the commen wealth, and had accused him most greevously in the
                  Senate, he commanded him to get out of the Citie, he changeth the handling of his
                  sentence, and translateth his speech to <term>Prosopopeia</term>: whereby he
                  faineth the country chiding with Catiline, and rehearseth in order all his
                  ungracious, mischeevous, and unluckie deeds, enerprised against it, accusing him
                  sore, and willing him to depart out of it. There hath saith he, no abhominable or
                  wicked deede bene heard or seene these many yeares but through thee: no naughtie
                  factes without thee: thou onely hast slaine many Citizens, and never yet punished:
                  thou hast vexed and robbed thy fellowes, and nothing said unto thee: thou hast not
                  only bene able to neglect lawes and statutes, but also to overthrow them and
                  breake them in peeces, with much more following. </p>
              
              <div type="commentary" subtype="subsubpart" n="2"><head>The second kinde of expolition.</head>

                <p>The second kinde of expolition is, when we speake one thing with many changes,
                  which as some Authours do teach, consisteth of seven parts: and what these parts
                  be, this example now following doth shewe. Whereby the Authour to Herenius
                  teacheth verie plainly the whole reason of publishing, thus: A wise man will
                  shunne no perill for the common wealth. Therefore as oft times it commeth to
                  passe, that when he which will not die for the common wealth, doth of necessitie
                  die with it. And because all commodities are received of the country, no
                  discommoditie ought to be esteemed great or greevous for the country, wherefore
                  they do unwisely which shun ye perill which must needs be bidden for the country:
                  for neither can they avoyd the discommodities, and against their own Cittie they
                  are found unthankfull. But they which with their own perill do willingly resist
                  the perils of their country, are judged wise men, for that they both render that
                  honour to the common wealth which they owe unto it, and had also rather die for
                  many, than with many. </p>
                <p>For it is a verie unreasonable thing to restore life received of nature, to
                  nature when she compelleth, and not to give it to thy country when she craveth it:
                  forasmuch as thou hast by thy countrey preserved it, and when thou maist with
                  great vertue and honour die for thy ocuntry, to choose rather to live by dishonour
                  and cowardnesse, and where as thou canst be content to put thy selfe in daunger
                  for thy friends parents, and the rest of thy kinsfolk, to be unwilling to enter
                  into danger for the common wealth, in which both this and that most reverende name
                  of countrey is contained. Therefore as he is worthie to be contemned, which in
                  failing had rather save himselfe then the shippe, so is he worthie to be balmed,
                  which in jeopardie of the common wealth provideth more for his private safetie
                  then for the common preservation. From a broken ship many have escaped from the
                  shipwrack of the ocuntry no man can well escape: which me thinke Decius did well
                  perceive, who as it is reported, bending himselfe to die for the safetie of his
                  souldiers, ranne into the middest of his enemies, whereby he let his life go, but
                  lost it not: for with a thing of smal value, he redeeme a thing of great price: he
                  gave his life, he gained his countrey: he parted with his life, he obtained glory:
                  which published with high praise, the elder it waxeth, the more &amp; more it
                  shall shine. </p>

                <p>Now forasmuch as it is shewed by reason, and proved by example, that we ought to
                  venture our lives for the common wealth, those men are to judged wise, which shun
                  no perill for the safetie of their country. </p>
                <p>Now albeit the Author hath given this example, yet an Orator is not alwaies so
                  straitly bound, as to observe everie point hereof: but hath a larger libertie to
                  use it, as it may seeme best unto him. </p>
              </div>
              <div type="commentary"><head>The use of this figure.</head>

                <p>The vertue of this figure is great and well worthie to bee reckoned and esteemed
                  among the most principall ornaments of eloquence, both in respect of the great
                  copie of words, and matter, and also of the diversitie of proofes and pleasant
                  varietie: the use of it is verie generall and fit for any great and weightie
                  cause. </p>
              </div>
              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                <p>In using exposition it is verie necessarie to avoid <term>Tautologies</term>, to
                  which the use of this exornation is much subject which may be easily prevented by
                  preparation, and the furniture of other figure. </p>
                <p>And also it behoveth him that shall use this figure to provide aforehand both the
                  platforme and the matter, lest his reasons and proofes be to seeke, or his
                  examples unreadie, or his similitudes unprepared, or his conclusion in the
                  wildernesse God knoweth where. </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div type="commentary" subtype="figure" n="Scemaismus"><head><term>Scemaismus</term>.</head>

              

                <p><term>Scemaismus</term>, when the Orator propoundeth his meaning by a circuite of
                  speech, wherin he would have ye understoode by a certaine suspicion which he doth
                  not speake, and that for 3. special causes. </p>
                <p>1. For safetie sake: As when it is undecent to be speake directly and openly. </p>
                <p>2. For modestie and good manners sake: As when it is undecent to be spoken
                  plainly. </p>
                <p>3. For delectation sake and grace of the hearer, as when it may bring greater
                  delight under the figurative shadow, then by the plaine report and open shew. </p>
                <p>1. If some good man for the love of justice and pittie of his countrey should
                  take upon him to reprehend a tirant, and to remove him from his crueltie, to an
                  equitie and mildnesse of government, he should venture upon a verie dangerous
                  enterprise, more likelie to loose his life, then obtaine his purpose, as often
                  experience hath prooved: Except the manner and forme of his handling the cause be
                  with the greater wisedome premeditated, and the more circumspectly delivered. For
                  Kinges and tirants which are mightie, are not wont, or can hardly heare their
                  faultes and wickednesse, which they commit with patient mindes, but rather kindled
                  with displeasure: goe not so soon in hand, to amend their errors, as to revenge
                  his advertisement: And therfore he that shoudl take this dangerous enterprise in
                  hand must doo it with a<note place="marg" anchored="false">This was wel observed
                    of Nathan.</note> cunning shadow of speech, and not in the sight of the Sunne, I
                  meane not openly and plainlie: for the naked truth doth often offend in a naked
                    tale.<note place="marg" anchored="false">2. Samuel. 12.</note>
                </p>
                <p>The Orators speech may be shadowed two manner of waies, either by reproving
                  another person, in whom the same evils are, or were in, while he lived: or by
                  commending such persons in whom the contraries are. If a man should in the respect
                  of reprehension speake to Dionysius the king of Sicilia, hee might reprove the
                  crueltie of Phalaris, and by an artificiall description and reprehension of that
                  creltie and tirannie in Phalaris, he may make a most bright and resplendent glasse
                  wherein Dionysius must needes behold himselfe and his deformed tirannie. </p>
                <p>Or if a man shall commend and highly praise those Princes and Kinges which have
                  done the contrarie, I meane, which have goverened by wisedome, equitie, moderation
                  and mercie. An evill man hearing the praises, and glorious fame of others, is
                  moved in mind, and begins to covet commendation and praise, and seeing it cannot
                  be obtained onely by desire, hee enclineth to the meanes by which he may deserve
                  it. </p>
                <p>For modesties sake, thus: whose mother is delighted with daily mariages,
                  signifying hereby her unchast life. </p>
                <p>The holy Scripture in this respect hath many examples, and chast Phrases, which
                  ought to be presidents to us as oft as we have occasion to expresse or signifie
                  matters which are bashfull &amp; undecent to be plainly told. </p>

                <p>Adam knew Eve his wife which conceived and bare Cain. </p>
                <p>Thou shalt not be excellent because thou wenteth up to thy fathers bed. Salomon
                  observeth most seemly the chastitie of speech, where he saith. Let her breastes
                  alwaies satisfie thee, and hold ever content with her love. And in the next verse:
                  Why shouldest thou unbrace the bosome of a stranger? </p>
                <p>Herein nature it selfe also seemeth to prescribe this dutie, that those thinges,
                  which she hideth, mans owne reverence ought to keepe secret. </p>
                <p>3. To delight the hearer by the grace of shadowed speech is very usuall among
                  pleasant wittes and apt conceites: and therefore I judge it needlesse to
                  exemplifie this part. Concerning the use and caution of this figure there is
                  alreadie sufficiently said. </p>
              
            </div>
            <div type="commentary" subtype="figure" n="Parenthesis"><head><term>Parenthesis</term>.</head>

              

                <p><term>Parenthesis</term> is a form of speec which setteth a sentence a sunder by
                  the interposition of another, or thus: When a sentence is cast betweene the speech
                  before it be all ended, which although it giveth some strength, yet being taken
                  away, it leaveth the same speech perfect enough. </p>
                <p>An example of Esay: At that time all vineyardes, (though there were a thousand
                  vines in one, &amp; sold for a thousand silverlings) shalbe turned into briers and
                  thornes. </p>

                <p>Another of the Apostle Paul: They are the ministers of Christ (I speake as a
                  foole) I am more, &amp; c. </p>
              

              <div type="commentary"><head>The use of this figure.</head>

                <p>A <term>Parenthesis</term> is often put in, when the speaker supposing that the
                  hearer may demaund a reason, or make an objection to that which he saith,
                  preventeth him by an interposition expressed before the sentence be all ended, so
                  that hereby it may appeare that a <term>Parenthesis</term> serveth to confirme the
                  saying by the interposition of a reason, and to confute the objection by the
                  timely prevention of an answere: Also where the sentence may seeme darke or
                  doubtfull, it putteth in a short annotation or exposition to give light and to
                  resolve the doubt. </p>
              </div>
              <div type="commentary"><head>The Caution.</head>

                <p><term>Parentheses</term> if they be verie long they cause obscuritie of the
                  sense, and sometime confusion of former and matter, in so much that the speaker
                  forgetting the former part of ye sentence knoweth not what the latter should be
                  Also a needlesse interposition is like unprofitable houshold stuffe that filleth
                  roome but doth no service: or like to the Missletoe, which albeit it standeth in
                  the tree, and liveth by his juice, yet is neither of the like nature, nor beareth
                  the like frute. </p>
