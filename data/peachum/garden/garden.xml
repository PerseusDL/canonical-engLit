                <ab type="opener">TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR JOHN Puckering Knight, Lord keeper of
                    the great seale of England.</ab>

                <p>Albeit (Right Honorable) it may seeme to some men at the first sight, a matter
                    importunate to interrupt your Lordships grave, deep, and weightie
                    considerations, sitting as you do at the sterne of the commonwelth in these
                    daies of danger, yet seeing the infimitie of our mortall estate cannot possiblie
                    indure to stand continually bent, no, not in the contemplation of the most
                    excellent subject, or matter of greatest importance, May it therefore please
                    your good Lordship (if for no other cause yet) partly for your owne ease,
                    release, and recreation, and partly for patronage to poore and painfull
                    studentes, to lend your honorable view to those my simple labours, hoping that
                    as you are not wont either to close your eies, or stop your eares to the meanest
                    or the poorest, so your Lordship wil not refuse to spare some time (when your
                    leasure may best permit) to cast your eie uppon these meane and simple frutes of
                    my studies: The argument whereof albeit I confesse it subject to the exceptions
                    of many, and peradventure to the reprehensions of some, which seeme to make a
                    divorce betweene nature and art, and a seperation betweene pollicie and
                    humanitie: yet Cicero being both a most excellent Orator and prudent politick,
                    doth mightily support, and defend it against all objections, as we may plainly
                    see in one short sentence of his (among many other tending to this purpose)
                    where he saith: Ut hominis decus est ingenium, sic ingenii lumen, est
                    eloquentia: <note place="marg" anchored="false">De claris oratoribum.</note>
                    that is, as wit is mans worship, or wisedome man honor, so eloquence is the
                    light and brightnesse of wisedome, in which sentence, he both expresseth the
                    singular praises of two most worthie vertues, and also enforceth the necessitie,
                    and commendeth the utilitie of their excellent conjunction. And true it is that
                    if we joine with this prudent Orator in a diligent inquisition and contemplation
                    of wisedome, and in a deliberate consideration of art, we shal see that verified
                    which he hath here affirmed. For if we enquire what wisedome is, we shall find
                    that it is the knowledge of divine and humane thinges, if whose gift it is, we
                    shall find that it is the knowledge of divine and humane thinges, if whose gift
                    it is, we shalbe certified, that it is the gift of God, if we consider the
                    inventions thereof they are woonderfull, if the works they are infinit, if the
                    frutes, they are in use sweete, in nature necessarie, both for the search of
                    truth and for the direction of humane life. Brieflie this vertue is the loving
                    &amp; provident mother of mankind, whom shee nourisheth with the sweete milke of
                    prosperitie, defendeth against manifolde dangers, instructeth with her counsell,
                    and prefereth to the imperiall dominion over all earthly creatures: and lest
                    dissenting with himselfe, he should by his owne contention worke his owne
                    confusion: she deviseth lawes to support equitie, and appointeth punishments to
                    represse injurie, she inventeth the art and skill of warre, to resist violence
                    offending against peace, she maintaineth the one, and directeth the other, and
                    is the mightie Empresse of them both.</p>

                <p>Finallie, by her the true felicitie of man is found out and held up, without her
                    it falleth by a sudden, and wofull ruine: by her it falleth by a sudden, and
                    wofull ruine: by her his honor is highly advaunced, without her it sinketh into
                    shame and reproach, and is utterlie confounded: by her hee is indued with a
                    blessed state of life, without her he perisheth in miserie and death. Now lest
                    so excellent a gift of the divine goodnesse (as wisedome here appeareth to be,
                    and is) should lye supprest by silence, and so remaine hid in darkenesse,
                    almightie God the deep sea of wisedome, and bright sunne of majestie, hath
                    opened the mouth of man, as the mouth of a plentifull fountaine, both to powre
                    forth the inward pasions of his heart, and also as a heavenly planet to shew
                    foorth, by the shining beames of speech) the privie thoughts and secret
                    conceites of his mind. By the benefit of this excellent gift, (I meane of apt
                    speech given by nature, and guided by Art) wisedome appeareth in her beautie,
                    sheweth her majestie, and exerciseth her power, working in the minde of the
                    hearer, partly by a pleasant proportion, &amp; as it were by a sweet &amp;
                    musicall harmonie, and partly by the secret and mightie power of perswasion
                    after a most wonderfull manner. This then is the vertue which the Orator in his
                    praise before mentioned calleth eloquence, &amp; the brightnesse of wisedome,
                    for that by the mean hereof, as well the rare inventions &amp; pleasant devises,
                    as the deepe understanding, the secret counselles, &amp; politick considerations
                    of wisedome, are most effectually expressed, and most comely beautified, for
                    even as by the power of the Sun beames, the nature of the roote is shewed in the
                    blossome, &amp; the goodnesse of the sap tasted in the sweetnesse of the frute,
                    even so the precious nature, and wonderfull power of wisedome, is by the
                    commendable ARt and use of eloquence, produced and brought into open light. So
                    that hereby plainlie appeareth, both the great necessitie &amp; singular
                    utilitie of their conjunction before commended, for the one without the other,
                    do finde both great want, and shew great imperfection, for to possesse great
                    knowledge without apt utterance, is, as to possesse great treasure without use:
                    contrariwise to affect eloquence without the discretion of wisdom, is, as to
                    handle a sweete instrument of musicke without skill. But the man which is well
                    furnished with both: I meane with ample knowledge and excellent speech, hath
                    bene judged able, and esteemed fit to rule the world with counsell, provinces
                    with lawes, cities with pollicy, &amp; multitudes with persuasion: such were
                    those men in times past, who by their singular wisdom and eloquence, made savage
                    nations civil, wild people tame, and cruell tyrants not only to become meeke,
                    but likewise mercifull. Hence it was, that in ancient time men did attribute so
                    great opinion of wisedome to the eloquent Orators of those daies, that they
                    called them sacred, holy, divine, &amp; the interpreters of the goddes, for so
                    doth Horace commending Orpheus, his words be these.</p>

                <quote rend="block">
                    <lg xml:lang="la">
                        <l>Agrestes homines sacer interpresque Deorum.</l>
                        <l>Caecibus, &amp; faedo victu deterruit Orpheus.</l>
                        <l>Dictus ob id, lenire tigres rigidosque leones.</l>
                    </lg></quote>

                <p>The Poet here under the name of tigres and lions, meant not beasts but men, &amp;
                    such men as by their savage nature &amp; cruell manners, might well be compared
                    to fierce tigres and devouring lions, which notwithstanding by the mightie power
                    of wisdome, and prudent art of perswasion were converted from that most brutish
                    condition of life, to the love of humanitie, &amp; polliticke government, so
                    might is the power of this happie union. (I meane of wisdom &amp; eloquence)
                    that by the one the Orator forceth, and by the other he allureth, and by both so
                    worketh, that what he commendeth is beloved, what he dispraiseth is abhorred,
                    what he perswadeth is obeied, &amp; what he disswadeth is avoided: so that he is
                    in a maner the emperour of mens minds &amp; affections, and next to the
                    omnipotent God in the power of perswasion, by grace, &amp; divine assistance.
                    The principal instruments of mans help in this wonderfull effect, are those
                    figures and formes of speech conteined in this booke, which are the frutefull
                    branches of eloquution, and the mightie streames of eloquence: whose utilitie,
                    power, and vertue, I cannot sufficiently commend, but speaking by similitude, I
                    say they are as stars to give light, as cordials to comfort, as harmony to
                    delight, as pitiful spectacles to move sorrow full passions, and as orient
                    colours to beautifie reason. Finally they are as martiall instruments both of
                    defence &amp; invasion, and being so, what may be either more necessary, or more
                    profitable for us, then to hold those weapons alwaies readie in our handes,
                    wherewith we may defend our selves, invade our enemies, revenge our wrongs, ayd
                    the weake, deliver the simple from danges, conserve true religion, &amp; confute
                    idolatry? for looke what the sword may do in war, for that with violence, this
                    with perswasion, that with shedding of blood, this with pearcing the sffections,
                    that with desire of death, this with speciall regard of life.</p>

                <p>Now, lest this part should seeme an emptie art of wordes, without wisedome or
                    substance of matter, I have gathered out of the most excellent Orators, &amp;
                    best approved authors, varietie of fit examples for everie figure by it selfe:
                    which figures or formes of speech, I have disposed into orders, described by
                    their properties, distinguished by their differences, noted their singular uses,
                    &amp; added certain Cautions to compasse them for feare of abuse. And now Right
                    Honourable, having finished this little booke (alhtough with no little labor) I
                    hope to the good of many, and hurt of none, with sincere affection, &amp; with
                    most humble dutie, I present it to your good Lordship, as to a lover &amp;
                    favourer of learning, in hope of your favourable acceptation, being mooved
                    hereunto by long experience of your lordships excellent wisdome, &amp; constant
                    goodnes, ready at al time to lend your helping hand (in good causes) to them
                    which by necessitie &amp; distresse, stood in need therof, among which, I am one
                    that have tasted of your goodnes &amp; comfort: the remembrance wherof, hath bin
                    one principall motive, of taking this labor in hand, to the end that I among the
                    rest which love and honour your Lordship, might have somewhat to signifie my
                    gratitude and bound dutie: beseeching your Honor, albeit this worke be such as
                    your Lordship shall litle need, being so richly furnished by nature, yet for
                    their sakes who may take benefit by it, you will please to shadow and protect it
                    under the wings of your honourable favour. That I may not trouble your Lordship
                    any further, I commend your Honour with my hartie praiers, to the mercifull
                    protection of the Almightie, beseeching him, that by his grace and mercy you may
                    long continue, to her most excellent Majestie a most faithfull and prudent
                    Counsellour, to the oppressed a reliefe, to innocents a sure protection, to your
                    country a treasure, to your friends a sure protection, to your country a
                    treasure, to your friends a comfort, to godlie and painfull students a gracious
                    Mecaenas, and to the posteritie of many ages, a renowmed president of
                    equitie.</p>

                        <p>The causes of <term>Tropes</term> are three, neccessitie will and arte,
                            &amp; of these three necessity was the first, for where there wanted
                            words <note place="marg" anchored="false">1. Necessity.</note> to
                            expresse the nature and propertie of diverse things, men were urged and
                            constrained to seeke remedie for the supply of so great a want,
                            whereupon wise men calling to remembrance that many things were verie
                            like one to another in some respect of nature though it good to borow ye
                            name of one thing, to signifie another, which did in some part or
                            property of nature resemble it, &amp; thus began they to use translated
                            speech: declaring their meaning by similitudes and compared
                            significations. Ant then, seeing that by this meanes matter were well
                            expressed, their meanings more largely uttered, and their invention well
                            commended, men in their private speech, and Orators <note place="marg"
                                anchored="false">2. Will</note> in their publike orations, refused
                            such words as were proper, and had litle sweetnesse, or could not
                            declare the nature of the thing so well, and used other wordes borrowed
                            from like things, both for the grace sake of the similitude, and also
                            for the cause of perspicuitie of the thing expressed.</p>

                        <p>Since upon good liking, and confirmed judgement, the wisdome of man hath
                            invented and found out an Art, not onely teaching where apt translations
                            may be found, but also giving excellent rules and certaine directions,
                            how they should be most aptly and properly applyed.</p>

                        <p>The places from whence translations may be taken, are infinite, not
                            withstanding there be certaine that be verie usuall, readie, apt and
                            pleasant, which I purpose hereafter to observe and note, as the most
                            plentifull fields, yeeldinrg such proffitable and pleasant flowers.</p>

                        <p>This excellent Art of translating, among other profitable rules
                            commendeth to us this necessarie observation to begin with, that is to
                            say, that those things ought to be equal in proportion, which we purpose
                            to compare by translation, that is, of foure things two ought always to
                            be compared to two, as for example, we say the flower of age, here in
                            this translation the herbe and the flower is compared to man and his
                            youth, for the same that the flower is in the herbe, the same is youth
                            in man. By the same proportion the Poet saith, unhappy Dido enflamed is,
                            in this example Dido and her love is compared to the wood and the
                            fire.</p>

                        <p>This rule is alwayes most diligently observed of wise and learned men,
                            whose words and works are by this singular forme of speech both
                            pleasantly beautified, and brightly adorned. The special commendation of
                            translated speech I will referre it to the proper use of everie singular

                            <p>It is apparant that memorie is the principall efficient of a
                                    <term>Metaphore</term>, for being the retentive power of the
                                mind, it is the treasure house of mans knowledge, which as it
                                possesseth the formes of knowen things, so is it readie at all times
                                to present them to mans use, as often as occasion, and cuase doth
                                necessarily require. As for example, he that hath seene a
                                caterpiller eating and devouring the tender buds and blossomes of
                                trees and plants, and ater this shall see an idle person living by
                                the spoyle of other mens labours, is put in mind to call him a
                                caterpiller: he that hath seene a gulph or gaping sinke, swallowing
                                a continuall streame or mightie quantitie of water and afterward
                                shall see a man consuming his substance and patrimonie in
                                prodigalitie and riot, is put in mind to call him a gulph of
                                patrimonie or a fluke of wealth.</p>


                            <p>It is to be confessed notwithstanding, that memorie worketh not all
                                alone in the framing of translations but hath erant judgements
                                alwayes to helpe her, for memorie presenteth the former part of the
                                comparison, and judgement applieth the later, for a man may castly
                                remember what he hath soene, but yet if he want discreete judgement,
                                he cannot aptly compare to it the thing that he now seeth although
                                there be some fit similitude betweene them, and also some
                                neccessarie occasion to use it: and therefore ample knowledge,
                                perfect memorie, and exact judgement joyning together in one mind,
                                are the principall and especiall causes of all apt and excellent
                                translations.</p>

                            <p>The places from whence translations may be taken are infinite, yet of
                                the infinite, yet of that infinite number certaine are chosen out,
                                as most apt, most usual, &amp; most commendable, which are these

                                    <head>1. From the sight.</head>

                                    <p>As the sight among the rest of the senses is most sharpe, and
                                        pierceth furthest, so is it proved most sure, and least
                                        deceived, and therefore is very nigh to the mind in the
                                        affinitie of nature, so farre foorth as an externall sense
                                        of the bodie may be compared to an internall vertue of the
                                        mind. The consideration hereof causeth men to use the words
                                        which are proper to this sense and that very often, as fit
                                        to signifie many vertues of the mind, as the understanding,
                                        knowledge, providence, carfulnesse, hope, opinion, judgement
                                        and such like. Hence it is that a man may say, I see your
                                        meaning, I see your malice, here the translation is from the
                                        sight to the mind: for to speakes properly we can not say,
                                        we see mens meanings, or mens malice, which are invisible in
                                        respect of our bodily sight. But yet in respect of our minds
                                        we may perciue, and understand them, as by some probable
                                        conjectures, or likely tokens collected by reason and
                                        judgement. An example of the holy Scripture, <cit>

                                        Being wise &amp; provident, by his singular foresight did
                                        timely smell out the ungratious practices, and private

                                        and pleasant odors, and therfore the use of this sense in
                                        translation is commonly used to signifie the pleasure of the
                                        mind, as the contraries are used to expresse the hatred and
                                        offence of mans heart, as when it is said, that abominations

                                        Job afterwards useth the same word, saying, the hand of God

                                    dumbe beasts: by this place, a tyrant is called a lyon, an
                                    extortioner a wolfe, a man without mercie a tigre, he that is
                                    deceitfull and subtle a foxe, and shamelesse rayler a barking
                                    dogge. In praise, the innocent is called a dove, the meeke and
                                    patient man a lambe, the faithfull in love and wedlocke a
                                    turtle. The particular properties of the dumbe creatures are
                                    very significent, especially in their Verbes and Verbals, for by
                                    whining we signifie murmuration &amp; grudging, by stinging
                                    secret mischief, by crowing proud and arrogant insulting, by
                                    swimming possession of abundance, or fruition of great
                                    felicitie, by roaring impatient miserie, by hissing terrible
                                    threatening, or bitter cursing, by hovering attending
                                    oportunitie, by devouring consumption, and by fawning
                                    flatterie.</p>

                                    By the same forme of speech we may call the emmet provident, the
                                    cat circumspect, the spider diligent, the toade mistrustfull,
                                    the raven wise, the serpent subtle. These particular
                                    translations serve to shew how neare these creatures do come to

                                    rage, the frost to bite, the ground to thirst, field and flowers
                                    to rejoyce. Also we say, that waters do roare. Also in maner, as
                                    if I should say, Doest thou not know that fortune is fleeting?
                                    that avarice is insatiable, that love is blind, that envie

                                    to private speech. this place for the most part is the fountaine
                                    of the figure called <term>Prosopocia</term> hence it is that
                                    Poets and Orators do attribute to things which are without life,
                                    not only life, but also reason and affection, and sometime
                                    speech. An example of Poetrie, The firmament bewailed his
                                    funerall, the sunne mourned and would not be seene, and the
                                    clouds shed great plentie of sorowfull teares. This kind of
                                    fained description, is framed only by attributing life, sense,
                                    reason, and affection to things which are voyd of them all. </p>

                                    maner we say, a stonie heart, a greene heard, a leaden wit, raw

                            or voyce of that it signifieth, or else whereby he affecteth a word
                            derived from the name of a person, or from the originall of ye thing
                            which it doth expresse. And this form of fayning, &amp; framing names is
                            used diverse wayes. First, by imitation of sounds, as to <note
                                place="marg" anchored="false">1. By imitation of sound.</note> say,
                            a hurliburly, signifying a tumult or uprore: likewise, rushing,
                            lumbring, ratling, blustring, creking, and may such like. <note
                                place="marg" anchored="false">2. By imitation of voyces.</note>
                            Secondly, by imitation of voyces, as the roaring of Lyons, the bellowing
                            of buls, the blating of sheepe, the grunting of swine, the croking of
                            frogs, the chattering of Pies, the chirping of sparrows, the howling of
                            dogs, the neighing of horses, ye hissing of serpents. Thirdly, by the
                            derivation from the original, as the citie Troy was so called by
                            derivation from king Troc, &amp; before that it was <note place="marg"
                                anchored="false">3. By derivation from the originall.</note> called
                            Teucria, from Teucrus and first of all Dardania from Dardanus, so
                            Ninivie of Ninus, so Luds-towne of Lud, and now London. Fourthly, by
                            composition, as when we put two words together <note place="marg"
                                anchored="false">4. By composition of two words.</note> and make of
                            them but one, as to say, Oratorlike, scholerlike: also to call a churle
                            thickskin, a niggard a pinchpeny, a flattere a pickthanke, a glutton a
                            bellygod. Fifthly, by reviving antiquity. <note place="marg"
                                anchored="false">5. Imitating antiquitie.</note> Touching this part
                            I will refer the Reader to Chaucer &amp; Gower, and to the new Shepherds
                            Calendar, a most singular imitation of ancient speech. The sixt maner of
                            speaking or writing by this figure is, when we signifie the imitation of
                            another mans property or fashion: this forme of speaking is very usual
                            in the Greeke tongue, and somewaht it is used in the Latine, as when
                            they say, Patrissare, matrissare, Platonissare, that is to say, to
                            imitate his father, to imitate his mother, to imitate Plato, which forme
                            our tongue can hardly imitate, except we should say, he doth fatherize,
                            Platonize, temporize, which is not much in use. Yet the English tongue
                            endevoreth what it can so speake by this part, as where it saith, I can
                            not court it, I can not Italian it, that is, I can not performe the
                            dutie or manners of a courtier, I can not imitate the fashion of an
                            Italian. </p>

                                observations ought to be regarded. First, concerning the imitation
                                of sound, that it be somwhat like to the thing it signifieth, and
                                not unlike, as if one should call the sound of a Cannon, a ratling
                                or cracking, it were farre from the fimilitude, or if he should call
                                the roaring of a Lion, a blating or a grunting, it were absurd if
                                the voyce should be extended to the uttermost in the word of
                                imitation, for that were most ridiculous. Thirdly, as is said in the
                                    <term>Metaphore</term>, unchast and vile imitation ought to be

                        <p><term>Synecdoche</term> in Latine called <term>Intellectio</term>, that
                            is, an understanding, and it is a forme of speech by which the Orator
                            signifieth more or lesse by a word, which the proper signification doth
                            not expresse: and it is by putting the whole for the part or the part
                            for the whole. </p>
                        <p>By the whole is meant, the whole of a quantitie, the generall kind, the
                            plurall number, the matter of which things are made. </p>
                        <p>1. The whole put for a part. An example: An host so great as dranke
                            rivers drie, meaning a great part of rivers. An example of ye holy
                            Scriptures: <cit>
                                <quote>All the world came to heare the wisdome of Salomon,</quote>
                                <bibl>1.Reg.10.</bibl>

                            it is expressed. </p>
                        <p>2. The generall kind for the speciall kind. An example of the holy
                            Scripture: Preach the Gospell to all cratures, signifying to all men,
                            and not to any other Creature. </p>
                        <p>3. The Plurall number put for the singular Cicero to Brutus: We deceived
                            the people, and seemed Orators, understanding but himselfe. </p>
                        <p>4. The matter for the things made of that matter: They eate the finest
                            wheate, and drinke the sweetest grapes, by wheate is understood bread,
                            and by grapes wine. </p>
                        <p>5. Things following put for things going before: Thou shalt eat thy bread
                            in the sweat of thy face. Here by sweat following labor, is signified
                            labor going before sweate. Hitherto the more is signified, and the lesse
                            is understood. </p>
                        <p>Now contrariwise the part is expressed and the whole is understood. An
                            example of Scripture: I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my
                            roofe. Here by the roofe is signified the whole house. Another example: <cit>
                                <quote>Blessed in the wormbe that bore thee and the pappes which
                                    gave thee lucke.</quote>
                                <bibl>Luc.11.</bibl>
                            </cit> There wombe &amp; the pappes do signifie the mother, and in the
                            holy Scripture the soule is often put alone, and signifieth the whole
                            man. </p>

                        <p>2 The speciall kind put for the general: it is not my sword that shall
                            helpe me, by sword is understood all kind of weapons, and maner of
                            defence. Another: <cit>
                                <quote>Man that not live by bread only,</quote>
                                <bibl>Mat.4.</bibl>
                            </cit> by bread is signfified all kind of food an nourishment. </p>
                        <p>3 The singular number for the plural: A man borne of a woman hath but a
                            short time to live, meaning all men. The Romane was victor in battle,
                            understanding the Romane host. </p>
                        <p>4 By things going before, things following are signified: He put the
                            people to the sword and the citie to the fire. Here by these words sword
                            and fire is signified the generall slaughter of the people, and utter
                            destruction of the citie, which presently folowed. Another example of
                            the holy Scripture: Say to the sonnes of Amon the sword is drawne, here
                            by the drawne sword is signfified the slaughter ensuing. </p>

                        <p><term>Metonimia</term>, called of the Latines
                            <term>Transnominatio</term>, and of some <term>Hypallage</term>, it is a
                            forme of speech, wherby the Orator putteth one thing for another, which
                            by nature are nigh knit together. This change of name is used foure
                            wayes. 1. The cause for the effect. 2. The effect for the cause. 3. The
                            subject for he Adjunct. 4. The Adjunct for the subject. </p>
                        <p>Under the name of the cause are contained the efficient, the inventer,
                            the commander, the instrument. </p>
                        <p>1 The efficient: <cit>

                                <bibl>Ezec.7.</bibl>
                            </cit> By pestilence and famine is signified death the effect of those
                            causes. Another: <cit>
                                <quote>I have called for a drought upon the earth.</quote>
                                <bibl>Agge.1.</bibl>
                            </cit> By drought is understood hunger and famine caused by drought. </p>
                        <p>2. The inventer for the thing invented: as Mars for warre, Ceres for
                            fruit, Bacchus for wine, Vulcane for fire, Mercurie for eloquence, ye
                            author for his work thus, He learned his argumented of Aristotle, &amp;
                            his eloquence of Tullie, he esseemed much of Livius, and tooke great
                            delight in Plato; signifying by these Authors their <note place="marg"
                                anchored="false">Luc.16.</note> workes. An example of the holy
                            Scripture: <cit>
                                <quote>They have Moses and the Prophets</quote>
                                <bibl>Luc.16.</bibl>
                            </cit>: that is, their bookes and volumes. </p>
                        <p>3 The commander or governour for those which are under his governement:
                            Hannibal was slaine by Scipio. Here Hannibal is put for his army which
                            he led against the Romans, and Scipio for the Romans who obtained the
                            victorie. </p>
                        <p>4 The instruments for their effects. Examples: <cit>
                                <quote>The scepter shall not depart from Juda.</quote>
                                <bibl>Gen.49.</bibl>
                            </cit> Another: The unlikely have worne the crowne. Here scepter and
                            crowne being instruments of royal dignitie do signifie a kingdom. <cit>
                                <quote>He beareth not ye sword for nought.</quote>
                                <bibl>Rom.13.</bibl>
                            </cit> Also: There shall no sword go through your land. In the former
                            example is understood by sword, the authoritie of a Magistrate, in the
                            later warre and conquest. </p>
                        <p>An example of Job: <cit>
                                <quote>Let me be weighed in an even ballance.</quote>
                                <bibl>Job.31.</bibl>
                            </cit> Here ballance, and instrument of equitie, is put for equity it
                            self. </p>
                        <p>In like maner we use to put the chaine for bondage, the key for office,
                            the rod for correction, and the crosse for persecution. </p>
                        <p>Secondly, the effect is put for the cause: by this we say, Death is pale,
                            feare sad, anger hastie, wine bold. Here is signified, that death maketh
                            pale, and feare maketh sad, and likewise of the rest. An example of holy
                            scripture: I am the resurrection, Christ meaneth that he is the cause of
                            the resurrection. Another: <cit>
                                <quote>There are two nations in thy wombe.</quote>
                                <bibl>Gen.25.</bibl>
                            </cit> Almightie God speaking this to Rebecca, signifieth by two
                            nations, the authors or fathers of two nations, that is, Esau the father
                            or author of the Idumeans, and Jacob the father or author of the
                            Israelites or Jewes. Another: <cit>
                                <quote>Death is in the pot O man of God,</quote>
                                <bibl>2.Reg.4.</bibl>
                            </cit> that is, a deadly thing, or a thing which is the cause of death. </p>
                        <p>Another example of Job: Be not thou too extreme upon my sin. Here Job by
                            sinne signifieth him selfe, the efficient of his sinne. </p>
                        <p>By this place also, an instrument in respect of his regent may stand as
                            an effect, and signifie his agent. An example: <cit>
                                <quote>As thy sword hath made many women childlesse, so shall thy
                                    mother be deprived of thee.</quote>
                                <bibl>1.Sam.15.</bibl>
                            </cit> Here Samuel putteth the sword for Agag the regent or agent of the
                            sword. </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the subject put for the Adjunct, the subject is that which
                            containeth, the Adjunct is that which is contained, and this containing
                            is sayd of diverse things diversly. </p>
                        <p>1 The possessor for the thing possessed. An example: <cit>
                                <quote>Juda shall be inhabited for evermore.</quote>
                                <bibl>Amos.1.</bibl>
                            </cit> Here Juda the sonne of Jacob is put for the land of Jewrie which
                            was promised to his posteritie, and by them possessed. Another: I pray
                            thee depart not from thy servant. Here Abraham understandeth his tent
                            under the naming of him selfe. By this place cities, lands, houses and
                            ships are often called by the names of their owners. </p>
                        <p>2 Time put for the things done in time. An example: I have considered the
                            dayes of old, and the yeares that are past. By dayes and yeares, the
                            Prophet signifieth the peace and prosperity which sometime he enjoyed.
                            By this place it is said, that the dayes thought is the nights dreame,
                            that the mornings view correcteth the evenings worke. In these two
                            examples the day and the night, the morning and evening do signifie the
                            actions and accidents in them. Hence it is, that times being put for the
                            accidents in them, are either commended or dispraised, as when we say, O
                            blessed time, O happy age, or as the Poet saith, My happie dayes be
                            past, my joyfull yeares be gone. In dispraise thus, O wicked world, O
                            malicious age. </p>
                        <p>3 Place put for the things it containeth. An example: <cit>
                                <quote>I call heaven and earth to record.</quote>
                                <bibl>Deu.30.</bibl>
                            </cit> Here Moses by heaven and earth <note place="marg"
                                anchored="false">1. The world.</note> understandeth the creatures of
                            heaven and earth, which he caleth to witnesse with him. </p>
                        <p>Another, Italie can not be overcome by warre, nor Greece by <note
                                place="marg" anchored="false">2. Countreys.</note> learning, meaning
                            the people in those countreys. </p>
                        <p>They invade the citie opprest with sleepe. By the city is meant<note
                                place="marg" anchored="false">3. Cities.</note> the Troyans being in
                            their dead sleepe and midnight. </p>
                        <p>An example of the holy Scripture, O Jerulalem, Jerusalem, thou which
                            killest the Prophets. By Jerusalem Christ signifieth the Rulers and the
                            people of that citie. </p>
                        <p>Another: <cit>
                                <quote>He made him ruler of his house,</quote>
                                <bibl>Gen.39.4.</bibl>
                            </cit> that is, of all his servants treasures, and goods within his
                            house. </p>
                        <p>4 The container for the thing contained: Is not the cup of<note
                                place="marg" anchored="false">4. Houses.</note> blessing, which we
                            blesse the communion of the blood of Christ? In this example ye Apostle
                            putteth the cup for the contents of the cup. Another: <cit>
                                <quote>There shall be one fold, and one shepherd,</quote>
                                <bibl>Joh.70.</bibl>
                            </cit> that is, one company or flocke. </p>
                        <p>Sometime the <term>Metonimia</term> of place signifieth the actions in
                            lace. An example: <cit>
                                <quote>For thy temples sake which is at Jerusalem, kings shall bring
                                    presents to thee.</quote>
                                <bibl>Psal.68</bibl>
                            </cit> Here by the Temple is understood the holy exercises and divine
                            worship used in the Temple. </p>
                        <p>In the same sense men use to say, The hall is done, meaning the actions
                            in the Courts of judgement. </p>
                        <p>4 The Adjunct for the subject. An example: Righteousnesse hath looked
                            downe from heaven, meaning God in whom righteousnesse resteth. Another: <cit>
                                <quote>There is no truth, no mercie, no knowledge of God in this
                                    land.</quote>
                                <bibl>Ose.4.1.</bibl>
                            </cit> By these Adjuncts the prophet signifieth that there are none, or
                            at least very fewe, in whome these vertues may be found. </p>
                        <p>Another: Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifteen yeares.
                            Here the flood being an Adjunk, signifieth time the subject. </p>

                                <term>Allegorie</term> is called a continued <term>Metaphore</term>. </p>
                        <p>An example: Rubbe not the scarre, lest you open againe the wound that is

                            Renue not by rehearsall the sorrow which time hath made forgot. </p>
                        <p>Another: Shall we suffer the monstrous Crocodile to come out of Nilus and

                            with his griping pawes, to crash our carkasses with his veimous teeth,

                            sucke our blood, to devour our birds, and to sleepe among our feathers?

                        <p>Examples of Poetical <term>Allegories</term>: O ship shal new flouds

                            feare of stormes </p>
                        <p>In the former verse Horace by Ship understandeth Sextus Popeius making
                            incursions, and troubling the sea with navall war, whom he exhorteth to
                            make peace with Augustus. By flouds he signifieth civill battell, and by
                            Port peace and concord. In the later he much commendeth mediocritie.
                            Horace was much delighted in this kind of speech, as may appeare by many
                            of his verses which he wrote Allegorically. </p>

                            their proper and usuall signification, whereof this may be an example:
                            Why doest thou covet the frute, and not consider the height of the tree
                            whereon it groweth? thou doest not forethinke of the difficultie in
                            climbing, nor danger in reaching, wherby it cometh to passe that while
                            thou endevorest to climbe to the top, thou fallest with the bough which
                            thou doest embrace. This <term>Allegorie</term> describeth although
                            somewhat obscurely, yet verie aptly, the danger, vanitie, and common
                            reward of ambition. The words which retaine their proper sense are
                            these, covet, consider, and forethinke, which words do make it a mixt

                            dreames were <term>AEnigmatical</term>, whose signification Joseph

                        <p>Also the vision of Nabuchodonozor was <term>AEnigmatical</term>, &amp;
                            most aptly proportioned in the similitudes, for under the forme of a

                            most excellently described. By the place where it was planted, were
                            described his seate and kingdome: by the height, his dignitie: by the
                            ample aspect, his great glory, and dread of nations toward him: by the
                            strength of that tree, his great power: by the beautifull leaves, his
                            gorgeous apparell and glorious pompe: by the frute, his wonderfull
                            rents, tributes, and revenues: by the meate of that tree, the wealth and
                            prosperitie of his people: by the shadow, the safe protection of his
                            subjects: by the birds among the branches, his prudent counsellers, and
                            mightie princes: and by that, that it is said, that all flesh did eate

                        <p>And now in like manner, the overthrow and confusion of all this is
                            proclaimed by the Angel, saying as followeth, Hew down the tree, breake
                            off his brances, and scatter his frute abrode, that the beasts may get
                            them away from udner his, &amp; the birds from his brancees,

                        <p><term>Hyperbole</term> of Cicero called <term>Superlatio</term>, of
                            Quintilian <term>Superiectio</term>, and it is a sentence or saying
                            surimounting the truth onely for the cause of increasing or diminishing,
                            not with purpose to deceive by speaking untruly, but with desire to
                            amplifie the greatnesse or smalnesse of things by the exceeding
                            similitude. </p>
                        <p>This figure Cicero useth much in the praises of Pompey, He hath made
                            saith he (meaning Pompey) moe battels then others have read, and
                            conquered moe provinces then others have desired. Now in this excesse of
                            his praise, Cicero meant not so much as he spake, but by making an
                            incredible report, he doth signifie that the noble actes of Pompey were
                            so worthy, and his victories so many, that they were almost incredible. </p>
                        <p>This figure is either simple or compared. Simple, as to call the belly of
                            a great glutton bottomlesse him that is most hastie in his furie
                            braineless, a notable coward hearlesse: who knoweth not that the meaning
                            of thse sayings is otherwise than the words do properly expresse? For by
                            this kinde of large speech the excesse of those vices are aptly
                            signfified. </p>
                        <p>Another example: Streames of teares gushed out of her eyes, and the
                            greatnesse of her griefe rent her heart in sunder. Here by these
                            incredible reports, her incredible lamentation and sorrow is signified. </p>
                        <p>This forme of speech is found in the sacred Scriptures, and that in many
                            places. Examples: <cit>

                            of comparison, as, to call a beautifull virgine an Angell, a good man a

                        <p>Secondly by the comparative degree, &amp; that from many places. </p>

                        <p>1 First from like things, as sweeter then hony, whiter then snow, lighter
                            then smoke, heavier then lead. </p>
                        <p>2 Secondly from living creatures, as swifter then the swallow, slower

                            toade. </p>
                        <p>3 Thirdly from fained and false gods, as, mightier then Mars, fairer then
                            Venus, wiser then Pallas, more eloquent then Mercurie. </p>
                        <p>4 Fourthly from persons fained in fables, as wearier then Sisiphus,
                            thirstier then Tantalus, more chast then Penelope, more foolish then
                            Grillus. </p>
                        <p>5 Fiftly from persons in Comedies, as, more glorious then Thraso, more

                        <p>7 Seventhly from Nations, as more cruell then a Scithian, more false then

                        <p>8 Eightly from dignities, offices, and conditions of life, as, more
                            stately then an Emperour, more vigilant then the watchman, more base

                            the speaker, as in this example: To one demanding of Diogenes what he

                            not what defence. To one that said, he knew not if he should be put out
                            of his house where to hid his head: another made him answer, that he

                            thanke you with all my heart. Here both the saying of Gnato, and the

                                following. An example of Cicero: For neither art thou he Catiline,

                                feare from perill, or reason from madnesse. Here the verbe could

                            <p>Another: The people of Rome destroyed Numance, wan Carthage, cast

                            <p>Another: Povertie hath gotten conquest of thy riches, shame of thy

                                unlike to the other. An example: Care for those things which may
                                discharge you of all care. Care in the first place signifieth to
                                provide, in the last the solicitude and dread of the minde. Another:

                                living without craft. In this example craft in the first place

                            <p><term>Articulus</term> is a figure which setteth one word from

                            <p>Another example: My friends and faithful souldiers, now is the time

                                tried by a secret sence of the eare: use &amp; exercise may do much

                                proper words respecting the former. </p>

                            <p>An example of Cicero: He left the citie garnished, that the same

                            <p>This is worthy by the way to be noted, that albeit singuler examples
                                are here set for the explication of singular affections or passions,
                                yet notwithstanding many and iverse affections may meete and joyne
                                in causing of our exclamation, as may be seene in the example of
                                Paul to Timothie last expressed: O man of God flee such things. </p>
                            <p>The causes of this exlamation are more than one: There is love in
                                Paul toward Timothie, for because he loveth him he disswadeth him
                                from danger. There is feare in Paul, for that which he possesseth by
                                love, he feareth lest it should be lsot by negligence. </p>
                            <p>There is also in Paul an hatred of the evil, from which he doth
                                disswade Timothie. There is in Paul a care of Gods glory lest it
                                should be obscured in his owne servant: all which affections joyning
                                together caused the Apostle to say: O thou man of God flee such
                                thinges. </p>

                                <p>There are diverse and necessarie observations to be considered

                                <p>First that it be not used without some great cause that may
                                    instly move to so vehement a forme of speech, for it is a

                                <p>Secondly, that it be not too often used lest it become

                            <p>To this place do belong many Proverbs and common sayings which are

                                Trust not a horses heele, nor a dogs tooth. And likewise this: Fire
                                and water have no mercy. Briefly the greatest part of all notable
                                sayings and common Proverbs were first framed uppon experience, and
                                are still supported by it: among which there are diverse in meeter
                                as this here following and many such like: I have heard my father

                            <p>There is no fishing to the sea, nor service to the king. Which saying

                                <p>This forme of speech is abused diverse wayes: first when it
                                    riseth from anger and malice without any likely conjectures<note

                                    such as men do commonly utter in thier rage, making malicious
                                    prognostications against the parties with whom they be angry, as
                                    that they wil be hanged, or that the Evill will one day fetch
                                    them, it would be a very wofull world if all such
                                    Prognostications should prove true: but for as much as they
                                    seldome take effect, the malicious planet is generally
                                    contemned, and the false Prognosticator is commonly derided. </p>
                                <p>Secondly, this figure is abused by prognosticating the

                                <p>Fiftly, it is wont to be abused by foolish observations of

                                mention of someting that it may be a fit occasion or introduction to
                                declare his further meaning, or principall purpose, which is a
                                speciall and artificiall forme of insinuation. A verie apt example
                                we have in the 17. of the Acts, of Paul who tooke an occasion by the
                                Aultar which he saw in Athens as he passed by, both to reprove the
                                idolatry of the Athenians, and also to teach them the true worship
                                of the living God. The Evangelist Luke doththus record it: Then Paul
                                stood in the midst of Mars street, &amp; said: Ye men of Athens, I
                                perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious, for as I
                                passed by, I found an aultar wherein is written unto the unknowne
                                GOD, whom ye then ignorantly worship, him shew I unto you, God that
                                made the worlde, and all things that are therin, seeing he is Lord
                                of heaven &amp; earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands,
                                neither is worshipped with mens hands, as though he needed any
                                thing, seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things, and
                                so consequently, he proceedeth to the full declaration of his
                                purpose. </p>

                                the speaker alledgeth a premeditated excuse conteining reasons of
                                such might as are able to vanquish all objections. A most artificall
                                example hereof is found in the answere of Aeneas to Dido, in the 4.
                                booke of Aeneidos, whereof I have gathered the summe both of the
                                objections of Dido, and of the answeres &amp; excuses of Aeneas, and
                                have put them into partes as they stand in the Author, and first of
                                her objection then after of his excuse and answere. </p>

                            <p>First, she objecteth by her suspition gathered from probable
                                    tokens<note place="marg" anchored="false">1.</note> and very
                                likely signes, his unkinde and wicked purpose to steale away from

                                his promise, faithfully plighted to her. </p>
                            <p>Secondly, she telleth him that for his sake, she is hated of
                                    forraine<note place="marg" anchored="false">2.</note> Princes,
                                and despised of her owne people, that for his sake her high and
                                exalted fame were utterly lost. </p>
                            <p>Thirdly, she declareth that for his sake the danger of conquest<note
                                    place="marg" anchored="false">3.</note> both of Carthage and her
                                kingdome were most like to ensue, if he should wilfully persist,
                                &amp; wickedly proceed in this his evil purpose, which did most
                                wofully and grievously appeare unto her. </p>

                            <p>To whose objection Aeneas maketh an anwere consisting of many parts
                                as followeth: First he confesseth her kindnesse, goodnesse, and
                                liberalitie. Secondly, he uterly denieth that ever his entent was to
                                depart by stealth. Thirdly, he telleth her that wedlocke was never
                                his meaning, nor his commng. Fourthly, he saith, that he greatly
                                desireth to restore his ancient citie of Troy. Fifthly, he alledgeth
                                that ye Oracle of Apollo calleth him from Carthage to Italy. Sixtly,
                                he argueth from equall comparison, that if she might take delight
                                and pleasure to ddwell in Carthage her native Citie and country, why
                                might not the Troyans likewise repaire to the land which they most
                                longed after? Seventhly, he sheweth her that his fathers ghost doth
                                every night warn him away. Eightly, that he did wrong to his sonne
                                Ascamus, to withhold him so long from Italy, his promised
                                enheritance. Ninthly, he signifieth that by a message from God
                                himselfe, both appearing to his eyes and sounding in his eares, he
                                is commanded to remove and depart from thence, and therfore wisheth
                                her to content her selfe, and cease her wailing for his love which
                                might not prevaile, and therefore in vaine. </p>

                                strong against him, useth gentle speech, faire promises, and humble
                                submission, to mitigate the rygor and crueltie of his adversary: we
                                have a notable example hereof in Jacob: who fearing the malice and
                                might of his brother Esau, used this meanes to appease his reage and
                                crueltie. He commeth before his family, as soone as he saw Esau, he
                                shewed a signe of dutiful submission he bowed himselfe seven times
                                most humbly before he came neare to him, calling him his Lord, and
                                himselfe his servant, his family al children came likewise in seemly
                                and suppliant order, and humbled themselves at his presence,

                            <p>The lyke example of submission there is in the third Chapter of

                                seemeth good to thee. So the men came to Olophernes and declared
                                them unto him after the same maner. </p>

                            <p><term>Eucharistia</term> in Latine <term>Gratiarum actio</term>, is a
                                forme of speech, bu which the speaker geveth thankes for benefites
                                received. </p>
                            <p>An example of Cicero: To thee O Caesar wee give most harty thankes,
                                yea great thankes wee yeeld to thee. </p>
                            <p>Another of our saviour Christ: Father I thanke thee for that thou
                                hast heard me. </p>
                            <p>This forme of speech is used much with acknowledging the benefites
                                received, and the unworthinesse of the receiver, whereof we have an
                                example in Jacob the Patriarch, where he saith in these words: <cit>

                                    flattery: To repeat thanks openly without some fit occasion
                                    inducing to it, is a point of folly. So in giving thaneks to
                                    name the benefites, namely if thy be very small and scarece
                                    worth thanks, in an absurdity in the speaker, and a disgrace to
                                    the giver: to give scornful thanks for frendly gifts is a most
                                    vicked and impudent ingratitude: To give compelled thankes doth
                                    accuse the receiver either of ingratitude, or of forgetfulnesse.

                                    <quote>Is it lawful to do good or to evil on the Sabboth? to

                            <p>In like manner he defendeth his Disciples being accused for pulling
                                the eares of corne on the Sabboth day, by alledging the example of
                                David eating the shew bread in his great hunger. Secondly by shewing
                                his authority being Lord of the Sabboth. And thirdly by citing a
                                sentence of Ose, which he thus applyeth: <cit>

                                with Publicans and sinners, he answereth saying: <cit>

                            praise or dispraise, to accuse or defend, and briefly they are most fit
                            formes for a most earnest and vehement oration. </p>

                                <p>An example of the author to herennius. Our auncestors if thy
                                    condemned any woman of one offence, they deemed her by plaine
                                    judgement to be convicted of many: by what reason? for whom they
                                    judge unchast in life, they esteemed also guilty of poysoning:
                                    why so? because it must needes be, that she which addicteth her
                                    body to unlawful lust doth feare many: who be they? her husband,
                                    her parentes, and others to whom she seeth the infamy of her
                                    dishonesty doth concerne: what then? it must needes be that by
                                    any meanes shee may, shee will indevor their destruction, whom
                                    she feareth so much: wherefore? because there is no honest means
                                    to hold her back whom the greatnesse of the offence maketh
                                    fearfull, intemprancy bold, and womans nature rash. What judged
                                    they of her which was condemned of poisoning? Also of necessity
                                    unchast of body: wherefore? because nothing might sooner move
                                    her to that wickednesse then dishonest love and intemperate
                                    lust. Forasmuch as they thought that the body of that woman
                                    could not be chast whose mind was corrpt: what did thy not
                                    observe the same in men? no: why so? because any desire doth
                                    thrust men forward to any one mischief, one desire leadeth women
                                    to all mischiefes. </p>
                                <p>Another example of the same Author: Our elders did wel provide
                                    this law, that it should not be lawfull to put to death any king
                                    whom they should take in battaile: why so? because it were
                                    against reason and equity to imploy that power which fortune
                                    hath given to us, in the punishment of those whom the same
                                    fortune had a little before placed in a most high and honorable
                                    estate: what for that he brought his army as an enemy? I do
                                    forget it: why do you so? because it is the part of a constant
                                    and valiant Captaine to esteeme them his enemies which do
                                    contend for the victory, and to judge them men which are
                                    overcome, to this end, that fortitude may diminish warre, and
                                    humanity encrease peace: but would he have done the like if he
                                    had won the field? I am perswaded he would not have been so wie:
                                    why then dost thou spare him? becuase I have alwaies used to
                                    contemne, and not to imitate such folly. </p>

                            <p><term>Synchoresis</term>, is a forme of speech by which the Orator
                                trusting strongly to his cause, giveth leave to the Judges or his
                                adversaries, to consider of it with indifference, &amp; so to judge
                                of it, if it be found just and good, to allow it, if evil, to
                                condemne and punish it. </p>

                            <p>An example of Cicero: But now Judges I leave the whole, and the most

                                that if my speech be either bitter or incredible unto you at the
                                first hearing, yet that you would accept it without offence spoken
                                of Marcus Cicero: Neither that you will reject it before I have
                                plainlie declared the whole unto you. </p>
                            <p>By this example of Cicero, we may see how this figure ought to be
                                used, by which he made an apt enterance, and ready pathway to his
                                purpose; which was boldly to blame the Senate, &amp; sharply to
                                rebuke their unconstancie, for that they were now about to joyne in
                                peace with Anthony, who a little before was adjudged and taken for
                                their utter and extreme enemy: and now having changed their minds,
                                were purposed to make him their friend. In the beginning he useth a
                                defence or mittigation, saying that hee speaketh with peril, &amp;
                                feareth in what sort or part his words may be taken, notwithstanding
                                he prounuseth that, that which he hath to say, shalbe for the
                                maintenance &amp; honour of the Senate, by which wise &amp; lowly
                                preparation, he obtained their favour to heare him: then next he
                                praieth them not to reject his wordes before he hath declared the
                                whole, how so ever displeasant they may seeme at the first. And
                                finally, that it might please them to take in good part, whatsoever
                                he should expresse and utter, promising that al should be for their
                                profit and advancement, and also protesting that it should proceed
                                from good will and entire affection. </p>

                                that is, when he hath long spoken of some person or thing, he

                                thing than a sudden removing from the third person to the second. </p>

                            <p><term>Apoplansis</term> is also another kind of aversion or turning
                                away, and it is when the speaker leadeth away the mind of his
                                hearer, from the matter propounded or question in hand, which maketh
                                much against him. The way and cunning to do this, is manifold &amp;
                                almost infinite. Cicero when he should have answered to an
                                accusation, in which it was objected that Caelius poysoned Metellus,
                                for as much as it was proved that Caelius had poison prepared in his
                                house: and furthermore that the force of that poison was tried in a
                                servant of his, he digressed by and by to Metellus death, and maketh
                                a suspition that he was poisoned by the mischievous deede of
                                Clodius: he sigheth, weepeth and bewaileth that death, whereby he
                                staieth and appeaseth his adversaries, and causeth them to mourne
                                with him, and to be striken (as it were) with the same wound, and so
                                by his vehement and forcible perswasion turneth the mindes of the
                                Judges from the cogitation of the fact, now and then touching it a
                                little, and slipping from it again. </p>

                                Tully. He doth amplifie the theftes, the sacrileges, the robberies,
                                the lecherous life of Verres, and also his new devised paines, and

                                crueltie of Chrysogomus, the impudencie of Erutius, the homicides of
                                Capiton, he doth vehemently invey against Pilo, vehemently against
                                Clodius, but most vehemently of all against Catiline. Contrariwise
                                he doth highly praise and comend the vertues of his frends, as the
                                knowledge, quicknesse and happinesse of Pompeius in warlike affaires
                                and martiall enterprises: he extolleth to the Cloudes Caesars
                                liberality towards his frends, his mercie towards his captives, and
                                magnifieth most marvellously the number of his victories. The

                                excelled all others of his time, for by his eloquence he oft cast

                                his copious speech and vehemencie of pleading, he frayed most

                                greedily to condemne, and made Catiline (a most audacious traitor)
                                dumbe in the Senate, with great vehemency and copie, he disputeth
                                much of religion, of duties, of the generall safetie of Citizens, of

                                passe. That Cicero repressed teh purposes of Catiline, thus it may
                                be set foorth. The mischievous enterprises of Catiline, who went
                                about the utter destruction of Rome, Marcus Tullius Cicero the
                                Consull, by his prudent foresight did quickly smel out by his
                                singular vigilance sought out, by his high providence found out, and
                                by his marvellous love to the ocmmon wealth shewed out. And then by
                                his incredible eloquence he convicted them, by his grave authoritie
                                repressed them, by his might abolished them, and by his great
                                happinesse quite overthrew them. </p>
                            <p>3 The numbring up of the causes, is when we declare not the matter or
                                effect nakedly, but rehearse the occasions and efficients whereby it
                                began, proceeded, and continued, as if one should in making report
                                of warre, shew also the occasion of the first kindeling, what were
                                the causes of debate, who were the motioners of enterprising the

                                both parts in their meeting. </p>
                            <p>Examples hereof are easily found in Poets and writers of histories:

                                from another, endeth them both by shewing a reason. Cicero for
                                Ligarius. I demaund now, whether you will revenge your owne
                                injuries, or the injuries of the common wealth: if you do revenge
                                the injurie of the common wealth: if you do revenge the injurie of
                                the common wealth: what answere will you make concerning your
                                constancie in that behalfe? If that you do revenge your owne, beware
                                you erre not, which think that Caesar will be angry and retaine
                                displeasure with your enemies, when he hath forgiven his own, not
                                covetousnesse, for the maner of his life doth shew that he was never
                                covetous, neither povertie for he hath great riches. </p>
                            <p>Another: Why should I now saie any thing to thy charge, if thou beest

                                declareth the proper pith of some thing, and it is chiefly used,
                                when there is a difference sought for between two words, which by
                                defining, this findeth foorth. </p>
                            <p>1 An example: This is not fortitude but temeritie, for fortitude is a
                                contempt of perils by honest reason: temeritie is a foolish
                                enterprise of perils, without respect of vertue. </p>
                            <p>2 Cicero for Marcus Marcellus: for neither is this to be counted thy
                                life, which is contained in thy bodie and breath, but that is thy
                                life (O Caesar I say) which shall live and floorish in memorie unto
                                the worldes end, which posteritie shal nourish, which eternitie
                                shall ever behold. </p>
                            <p>3 Glorious victorie consisteth not in slaying of poore people, as
                                women, children, and impotent persons, which hunger and famine,
                                wherein resteth neither fortitude, prudence, nor pollicie, but in
                                subduing of couragious Captaines, overcomming of valiant souldiers,
                                and winning of strong and mightie Cities. To this distinction, a
                                lyke answer is made, a glorious victorie consisteth not so much in
                                crueltie as in humanitie, not so much in shedding of blood, as in
                                shewing of mercy. Fire doth consume, &amp; the sword doth devour,
                                but famine by litle and litle maketh tame the most puissant nations
                                and stoutest people of the world. </p>

                            <p>By this exornation also a word or an action, is eloquently
                                distinguished in degrees by certaine generall wordes, thus: To powre
                                forth thy curse against thy adversary is malignity, against an
                                innocent crueltie, against thy parent impietie, against God
                                blasphemie. </p>
                            <p>Another example: To refute good counsell is folly, to contemne it is
                                wickednesse, to scorne it is madnesse. </p>

                                those partes, and maketh them plaine by a kind of definition, or

                                sinne and iniquitie, pleasures are the daughters of dishonesty, and
                                guides which lead to misery: Honors are mothers and nurces of
                                worldly pompe, and vanitie. </p>
                            <p>There are three sorts of men which do dispose of all that a man hath,
                                the Lawyer, the Phisition, and the Divine. The Lawyer disposeth of

                        <p><term>Descriptio</term> is a generall name of many and sundry kindes of
                            descriptions, and a description is when the Orator by a diligent
                            gatherin together of circumstances, and by a fit and naturall
                            application of them, doth expresse and set forth a thing so plainly and
                            lively, that it seemeth rather painted in tables, then declared with
                            words, and the mind of the hearer therby so drawen to an earnest and
                            stedfast contemplation of the thing described, that he rather thinketh
                            he seeth it then heareth it. By this exornation the Orator imitateth the
                            cunning painter which doth not onely draw the true proportion of thines,
                            but also bestoweth naturall colours in their proper places, whereby he
                            compoundeth as it were complexion with substance and life with
                            countenance: for hence it is, that by true proportion and due coloure,
                            cunning and curious Images are made so like to the persons which they
                            present, that they do not onely make a likely shew of life, but also by
                            outward countenance of the inward spirite and affection. </p>
                        <p>So great and singular is that science, that there is no creature under
                            heaven, no action, no passion, no frame in art, nor countenance in man,
                            whose true proportion and externall forme is not finely counterfaited,
                            and wonderfully imitated. Trees and plaints in their colours, flowers in
                            their bewty, beastes &amp; birdes in their natures, men in their
                            countenances and habite, some grave, some smiling, some angry, some
                            weeping, some yong, some old, some asleepe, some dead, also in their
                            degrees, as Princes and subjects, magistrates and prisoners, riche men
                            and beggers, men of artes and occupations, ladies, gentlewomen, maidens,
                            old women, captains, souldiers, finally al kind of persons in their
                            countenance, gesture and apparell: even so doth the Orator by his art
                            and his speech describe and set forth to the contemplation of mans mind,
                            any person, deede, thing, place or time, so truly by circumstance, that
                            the hearer shall thinke that he doth plainly behold the matter
                            described. Now under the generall name of <term>Description</term>, I do
                            not only reckon speciall kindes of description, but also all other
                            figures, which do chiefly respect circumstances and adjuncts without
                            form of comparison serving onely to make matters evident and lightsome. </p>

                                speake, to commend, to dispraise, to aske, to complaine, also life

                            <head><term>Pathopeia</term>.</head>



                            <p><term>Pathopeia</term>, is a forme of speech by which the Orator
                                moveth the minds of his hearers to some vehemency of affection, as
                                of indignation, feare, envy, hatred, hope, gladnesse or sorrow: of
                                this there be two kindes. </p>
                            <p>The first is when the Orator being moved himselfe with anie of these
                                affections (sorrow excepted) doth bend &amp; apply his speech to
                                stir his hearers to the same: and this kinde is called
                                    <term>Imagination</term>, to which diverse vehement figures do
                                belong, as <term>Exclamatio</term>, <term>Obteslatio</term>,
                                    <term>Imprecatio</term>, <term>Optatio</term>,
                                    <term>Exuscitatio</term>, <term>Interrogatio</term>, and such
                                like. And to move mirth, formes of speech serving to that purpose,
                                as <term>Asteismus</term>, and others of that kinde. Now as I sayd
                                before, matters that fall into this figure ought to be great,
                                cruell, horrible, odious, pleasant, or marvellous, for the greater
                                ye caue is, the sooner the affections of the hearers are moved.
                                Examples hereof are common in Tragedies, but of mirth and laughter
                                in Comodies. </p>
                            <p>2 The other kind of <term>Pathopeia</term>, is when the Orator by
                                declaring some lamentable cause, moveth his hearers to pitie and
                                compassion, to shew maerc, and to pardon offences. To move
                                compassion, lamentable histories are oftentimes used, and likewise
                                the lively descriptions of wofull sufferings, and pitiful miseries,
                                and how they may be artificially expressed. Poets complaints may
                                give apt examples. </p>
                            <p>To pardon offences the perorations of Cicero are good presidents. A
                                serious and deepe affection in the Orator is a mightie furtherance
                                and helpe to this figure, as when he is zealous, and deeply touched
                                himselfe with any of those vehement affections, but specially if he
                                be inwardly moved with a pitifull affection, he moveth his hearers
                                to the same compassion and pitie, by his passionate pronunctiation.
                                For true it is, that the apt bending of ye voice to the qualitie and
                                nature of the cause, is not only a necessary dutie in an Orator, but
                                also an excellent ornament. </p>

                                <p>This figure pertaineth properly to move affections, which is a
                                    principall and singular vertue of eloquution. </p>

                                <head>The Caution.</head>

                                <p>In the use of this figure there are many and necessary points to
                                    be observed. First that the causes themselves may be suficient
                                    to move the mindes of the hearers to affections and passions,
                                    for it must be effectual matter, and not bare words that may
                                    worke so great effects in prudent hearers. </p>
                                <p>Secondly, that there be a discreet observation of necessarie
                                    circumstances, as in what causes, what affections are to be
                                    moved, for in divine Orations, and Sermons, to move laughter
                                    doth much diminish and oppose the modestie of so grave an
                                    action, and so serious a cause. </p>
                                <p>Secondly when and where, (that is) the time and place had need to
                                    be diligently observed, lest through want of discretion such
                                    affections be moved as are most unfit for the time, or unmeete
                                    for the place, as mourning at marriages and joyfull meetings:
                                    and contrariwise mirth at funerals &amp; houses of mourning, are
                                    both repugnant to nature and contrary to custome. </p>

                                <p>Thirdly, it is verie needfull to shunne the untimely, and too
                                    hastie chaunge of affections, for first to move pittie or
                                    weeping, and then presently to turne weeping, into laughter or
                                    contrariwise, wheweth the follie to be great, and maketh the
                                    action absurd. </p>
                                <p>Fourthly it is the part of a prudent Orator to observe a measure
                                    in moving affections, lest he kindle that which he is not able
                                    to quench. </p>
                                <p>Fiftly, fained matter, fond gesture, and counterfait
                                    pronountiation ought to be hated and avoyded. </p>

                                sharpe teeth, crooked clawes, gaping mouth, runneth hither and
                                thither, and looketh everie where whom he may finde to spit his
                                poyson uppon, whom he may catch in his mouth, crash in sunder with
                                his teeth, venome with his tongue and rent in peeces with his pawes. </p>
                            <p>Saint Barnard painteth the cart of covetousnesse in this maner:<note

                                two sharpe whippes: Greedinesse of getting, and Feare of loosing.
                                This vice as you see, hath but one servant, because he is loth to

                                properly belong, and that either to praise or dispraise, to amplifie

                                Pastors, godly Ministers, faithfull friends, just Stewards, painfull

                                Sometime the Epithet is put after his substantive, &amp; that most

                                he is not wise at all: this and such like formes of speaking are
                                used for modesties sake, for it were not so seemly to say that he
                                lacketh wit or that he is a foole: or thus it is no smal account
                                that he maketh of his owne wit, he setteth not a little by himselfe:

                                any means do it in more modest manner then by this figure, as if he
                                should say: I was not the last in the field to fight against the
                                enemies of my countrey, neither have I been least esteemed or worst
                                accounted of in the love &amp; favour of noble men, here if he
                                should have said, I was first or one of the formost in the field, I
                                have been best esteemed or equal with the best, it would have
                                favoured of arrogancie and boasting, although he had said never so
                                truely, yet is there enough said to get praise. </p>

                                        <term>digression</term> may some maner of way profit comend,

                                contrarie: like things are compared among themselves, unlike from

                                lesse in diminishing, and contaries by opposing one against another. </p>
                            <p>1. Comparison of like thinges, as Camillus by his vertue did drive

                                things must needs be darkened, drowned, and destroyed by the glorie

                                that hath the best knowledge in guiding the ship: even so is it

                            <p>As if maketh no matter whether you laie a sicke man in a bed<note

                            <p>2. Nation: art not thou worthie of blame being an Englishman borne to

                                worthy to be punished? How dare you being a private person resist
                                your magistrate? a rich man to steale, a poore man to be proud, are

                            <p>10. The nature of the mind: God hath given you a valiant heart, and
                                shall carefull thoughts overcome you? you have had alwaies a
                                constant mind, and shall trifles quench your old frendship? </p>
                            <p>11. Studie: You studie the law which is the maintenance of right,
                                with what face or conscience can you offer this wrong? </p>
                            <p>12. Foredeedes: When a man hath in his youth and former part of his
                                time been vertuous, well geven, liberall and pittifull, valiant and
                                hardie, and now to fall from all vertue to all vice, to become hard,
                                cruell, cowardly, slouthfull and carelesse, amplifieth greatly these
                                crimes by which those excellent vertues are oppressed. </p>
                            <p>13. You counselled them to take this ungracious enterprise in hand,
                                and therefore your punishment is like to be thereafter. </p>
                            <p>By his counsell the armie was directed, the Cittie beseiged, won and
                                conquered, the greater is therefore the fame of his wisedome. </p>
                            <p>14. Name: Is thy name Salomon, and hast no more wisedome? doest thou
                                feare to be a souldier, and thy name Alexander? </p>

                            <p><term>Anthypophora</term>, when we grant to an objection, bringing in
                                another thing which maketh the same objection tollerable, Cicero: I
                                confesse i tooke that thing upon me, peradventure a matter of great
                                importance, and also dangerous unto me: yet notwithstanding a cause
                                worthie, for which I was bound to straine the strength of my age
                                &amp; diligence. </p>

                                by painful travel and valiant adventures therein shal ensue immortal
                                glorie. </p>
                            <p>I cannot denie but the way to learning and wisedome is long and
                                painful, the ascent steapie and slipperie, the season darke and
                                mistie, false turnings many, beside stops, and many other kindes of
                                discouragements: yet by labour and constancie o nce attained, it
                                bringeth with it a plentiful harvest, I meane both of profit and

                            <p><term>Paramologia</term>, of some called <term>Paralogia</term>, it
                                is when the speaker granteth many things to his adversary worthie of
                                commendation, and at the length bringeth in some notable crime,
                                which oppresseth and quencheth all that was granted before. Cicero
                                for Flaccus: Notwithstanding this I say concerning the whole nation
                                of the Greekes, I grant unto them learning, I grant unto them the
                                knowledge of many Artes, I take not from them the comely grace of
                                speech, fine wittes, singular eloquence. And futhermore, if they
                                challenge unto themselves any other thing, I will not deny it them,
                                yet religion and faith that nation never favoured, what vertue, what
                                authoritie, what waight there is of all this matter, they know not. </p>
                            <p>Also it is by this gifure when the speaker in his conclusion bringeth
                                in that whcih was not looked for, or that which is contrary, or at
                                least farre distant from the premises. As for example, Salomon
                                rehearseth the partes of his felicitie, he mentioneth his riches,
                                possessions, sumptuous buildings &amp; pleasures: but suddenly he
                                concludeth that all this is but vanitie and vexation of spirit. This
                                conclusion commeth unlooked for, and verie unlike to have ensued
                                such premises, the expectation tendeth rather to heare what
                                felicitie followed all this wealth and great possession: and not
                                what vanitie or vexation of sprit. </p>

                            <p>The like example of this manner of speaking is in the 21. of Job,
                                where he first describeth the prosperitie of the wicked, and then
                                concludeth that suddenly they go downe to the grave. </p>

                                    which the Orator confuteth by a conclusion suddenly inferred,
                                    for which respect it may be compared to the practice of

                            <p>4 From the contrary thus: As I have spoken of his great adversitie
                                and miserie, so will I now speake of his happy prosperitie, which at
                                length ensued, as the bright day doth the darke night, and warme

                            <p>An example: Pompeius prepared for war in winter, began it in the

                                thinke his adversarie would, and then refelleth it by a reason,
                                whereby he doth providently prevent him. Cicero: as if some Judge or
                                commiissioner might say unto me, thou mightest have contended with a
                                lighter action, thou mightest have come to thy right by a more easie
                                and profitable way: wherefore either change thine action, or resist
                                me not as Judge: or if he do prescribe after what sort I ought to
                                sue for my right, to which objection he maketh this answere.
                                Notwithstanding he seemeth either more fearfull then is reason a
                                Judge should be: or else he dareth not judge that which is committed
                                to him. Likewise against Verres, Cicero saith, that he knoweth some
                                men will marvell, seeing so many yeares he defended many, and hurt
                                none, he doth now come to accuse Verres, then he doth shew them that

                            <p><term>Expeditio</term>, when many reasons being reckoned by which som
                                thing may be doen or not done, one reason is left which the Orator
                                standeth unto &amp; concludeth upon, and the other are taken away,
                                thus: Seeing this ground was mine, thou must needes shew, that
                                either thou diddest possesse it being void, or made it thine by use,
                                or bought it, or else that it came to thee by heritage: Thou
                                couldest not possesse it voide when I was in possession: also thou
                                canst not make it thine by use: Thou hast not to shew that thou
                                diddest buy it, it could not come to thee by inheritance, and I
                                alive: it followeth then that thou wouldest put me from mine owne
                                ground, before I be dead. </p>

                            <p>Another example: Knowing that almightie God hath in his hand all
                                thinges that we neede, how shall we come by them? we can take
                                nothing from him by force, for he is most strong and mightie: nor
                                get any thing from him by fraud, for he is most wise and provident:
                                if we challenge any thing of him by law, he will prove that he oweth
                                us nothing, wherefore it followeth that either he must give them, or
                                else we must go without them. </p>

                                applying of it to our purpose, whereof there be two kindes, the one
                                true which is taken from Chronicles &amp; Histories of credit, and
                                it is of great force to moove, perswade, and enflame men with the
                                love of vertue, and also most mightie to deterre and disswade them
                                from vice: It is also used not onely to confirme matters, but even
                                to augment, enrich, bewtifie, and garnish them with much
                                comelinesse. </p>

                            <p>Examples which are usually applied in these respects, be either like,
                                unlike, or contrarie, and therefore they are used commonly in a
                                comparative forme, and being aptly compared, and fitly applied, they
                                present to the view and contemplation of our minde, the true of
                                lively Image of time past, for by them it is that we know and see
                                what was done long before our birth, not onely at home, but also in
                                countries far distant from us, for by histories and memorials of
                                deedes done and saying uttered, which are the fountaines from whence
                                we take our examples: we behold ancient deedes and sayings of
                                antiquitie, not as past but as present, Princes, Patriarchs,
                                Prophets, tirants wise men and fooles, holie and wicked, not as
                                dead, but as living, ruling, teaching, doing or speaking, everie one
                                following the inclination of his will, either directed by godly
                                wisedome, or seduced by ignorance, and malice. </p>
                            <p>These are they whom wee diligently looke uppon with the eies of our
                                mindes, and also deepely considering both what they were, what they
                                did, what they received, and what they suffered: if they were Kinges
                                how they ruled and governed, if Patriarches how they lived, if
                                wisemen what they said, if fooles, what they committed, if godly
                                what they reaped, and also if wicked, how and in what manner they
                                were punished, whereby wee do plainly appeareth, that there is a
                                most just justice in GOD, by whose wisedome, love, favour and mercie
                                good men are protected, advanced, and made happie: and contrariwise,
                                the evill and wicked by his judgement and power are justly punished. </p>
                            <p>These and other such like frutes we reape by the benefit of examples,
                                and therefore their use in doctrine is to be greatly commended, so
                                be it, that they be aptly applyed and truely expressed, for they
                                instruct plainly, move mightily, &amp; perswade effectually.
                                Finallie, their use is generall, for they are in their natures and
                                severall properties apt to enrich, garnish, confirme and amplifie
                                any matter or cause be it never so great, so grave, or so excellent.
                                Thus much for the use and commendation of examples. </p>

                                <p>In the use of examples there are diverse and necessarie
                                    observations to be diligently regarded. </p>
                                <p>First, that a good example be not ill applied, as to a false
                                    purpose and wrong end. </p>
                                <p>Secondly, that we make not publicke examples of private actions. </p>
                                <p>Thirdly, that we alledge not an ill example of a good man to
                                    confirm sin, as to alledge the bigamie of Jacob, the adulterie
                                    of David, and the crimes of other holy men to confirme the like
                                    sinnes. </p>
                                <p>Fourthly, that we confirme not holy Scriptures by prophane
                                    examples. </p>
                                <p>Fiftly, that we use not reverend examples unreverently, nor such
                                    as be grave in light matters, nor contrariwise light and wanton
                                    examples in reverend, and grave causes. </p>
                                <p>Sixtly, the extraordinary examples of extraordinarie persons are
                                    not to commended to imitation. </p>

                                    fables for delecations sake, &amp; those fained examples are
                                    taken from Poets inventions, and from the devises of Apollogies,
                                    and fables attributed to brute creatures, as to beastes, birds,
                                    fishes, bees, antes, and creeping wormes, also to trees, hearbs,

                                    especially to the simpler sort, yet being wittilie invented, and
                                    aptly applied, they are not onely allowed of wise men, but also

                            <p><term>Gnome</term>, otherwise called <term>Sententia</term>, is a
                                saying pertaining to the maners and common practises of men, which
                                declareth by an apt brevitie, what in this our life ought to be
                                done, or left undone. First it is to to observed, that everie
                                sentence is not a figure, but that onely which is notable, worthie
                                of memory, and approved by the judgement and consent of all men,
                                which being such a one, maketh by the excellency therof the Oration
                                not onely beautifull and comely, but also grave, puissant, and full
                                of majestie, whereof there be sundry kindes. </p>
                            <p>The first a Sentence universall, which conteineth no certaine person
                                or thing: As evill gotten goods are evill spent: evill will never
                                said well: envy is a punishment in it selfe. </p>
                            <p>The second is a single sentence, as, a Citie in sedition cannot be
                                safe, the contented man is verie rich, neccessitie hath no law. </p>
                            <p>The third is a double sentence: Flattery getteth friendship, and
                                truth hatred: And old sore is soone hurt, and a testie man soone
                                angrie. </p>
                            <p>In all worldly matter something ever lacketh, and nothing long
                                endureth. </p>
                            <p>The beginning of everie action is easilie seene, but the sequele is
                                uncertaine. </p>
                            <p>The fourth is a sentence without shewing a reason: Yoong men ought to
                                reverence their elders: Silence doth well beseeme women kinde. The
                                hastie man never wanteth wo. </p>
                            <p>The fifth, a sentence rendering a reason: He that doth evill, hateth
                                the light, lest his deeds should be repoved. </p>
                            <p>It is good to live so, that the rehearsall of our lives may not make
                                us ashamed. </p>
                            <p>Cast not too much away with thy hands, lest thou be forced to seeke
                                it with thy feets. </p>
                            <p>The first, is a sentence consisting of contraries: By concord small
                                thinges encrease, by discord great riches are soone consumed. </p>
                            <p>A guiltie conscience is alwaies afraid but he that hath done no evil
                                liveth in quiet. Better is a messe of pottage with love, then a fat
                                oxe with evill will. Salomon is much delighted with this kinde of
                                sentence: for many of his proverbes be compounded of contrary
                                sentences </p>
                            <p>The seventh, is a sentence of diverse things, as: Death is not to be
                                feared, but the way and passage to death. </p>
                            <p>Error and repentance, are the companions of rashnesse. </p>
                            <p>The eighth, a sentence shewing what doth happen in life, as: Pride
                                goeth before, and shame commeth after. Prodigalitie is the mother of
                                povertie. To day a king, to morrow dead: Life and death are in the
                                hands of the toong, mans nature is covetous of newes, we court after
                                things forbidden, and loath those which are commanded. </p>
                            <p>The ninth is a pure sentence, not mixt with any figure, as: It is
                                good to be merry and wise. He is happie which taketh warning by
                                other mens harmes. </p>
                            <p>The covetous man wanteth as well that which he had, as that which he
                                hath not. </p>
                            <p>The tenth, is a sentence of equitie: Do as thou wouldst be done to.
                                He that is mercilesse shall of mercy misse. </p>
                            <p>The eleventh is a figured sentence, whereof there be as many kindes,
                                as there by figures: If it be figured, it beareth the name of the
                                figure wherewith it is joyned. </p>

                                <p>Now in a sentence heede must be taken, that it be not false,
                                    strange, too long, or light, without pith or importance.
                                    Secondly, that they be not too oft used, and too thin sprinkeled
                                    in our speech, for that which is lawfull for Philosophers, is
                                    not granted to Orators, because Orators are the handlers of
                                    matters, and Philosophers the instructers of life. </p>

                                <p>The use of sentences is marvellous great in morall Philosophie,
                                    and also verie profitable, and pleasant in the Art of
                                    Rhetoricke: yet are sentences verie sparingly sprinkeled in the
                                    Orations of the most eloquent Orators, and that onely in
                                    consideration of their singular beautie and brightnesse: for
                                    excellent sentences ought to be esteemed as precious pearles and
                                    costly jewels in princely vestures, and as the most glorious
                                    lightes in the firmament: all which as they are most excellent
                                    in beautie and glorie, so are they most rare by creation and

                                    the one, that the interpretation be a true declaration of the

                                    obscure it, as some enterpreters now and then do, who through

                            <p>Cicero: I have now to speake of the excellent and singular vertues of
                                Pompeius. There was no cause why Nevius should demand of the Pretor,
                                that he might possesse the goods of Quintius by an injunction.
                                Cicero against Verres. It is necessary to speake concerning our
                                contention, that you may have what to follow in defending your
                                accuser. Cicero against Catiline: And because the decree of the
                                Senate is not yet written, I will shew you as much thereof as I can
                                call to remembrance. Also, before I begin to speake of the common
                                wealth, I will complaine a litle of the injuries yesterday done by
                                Anthony. </p>

                                    be considered. </p>

                            <p>Secondly by altering of pronounciation, that is to say, when the
                                Orator doth occupie or repeat the same wordes and sentences with a
                                certaine alteration and chaunge of his voice and gesture. Sextus
                                Roscius is convicted that he slew his father. Now this is said with
                                a plaine pronunciation: Did Sextus Roscius slay his father? with an
                                interrogation, which is full of marvelling: and likewise that which
                                the Orator hath uttered in hot and vehement speech, he may repeat
                                again with coole and quiet words. </p>
                            <p>Thirdly by alteration of the handling or entreating, as when the
                                Orator conveyeth his speech either to <term>Prosopopeia</term>,
                                    <term>Sermocinatio</term>, <term>Exusciatio</term>, or to any
                                other such like figure. Cicero when he had reckened up many
                                mischievous deedes of Catiline, and many of his wicked doinges
                                practiced against the commen wealth, and had accused him most
                                greevously in the Senate, he commanded him to get out of the Citie,
                                he changeth the handling of his sentence, and translateth his speech
                                to <term>Prosopopeia</term>: whereby he faineth the country chiding
                                with Catiline, and rehearseth in order all his ungracious,
                                mischeevous, and unluckie deeds, enerprised against it, accusing him
                                sore, and willing him to depart out of it. There hath saith he, no
                                abhominable or wicked deede bene heard or seene these many yeares
                                but through thee: no naughtie factes without thee: thou onely hast
                                slaine many Citizens, and never yet punished: thou hast vexed and
                                robbed thy fellowes, and nothing said unto thee: thou hast not only
                                bene able to neglect lawes and statutes, but also to overthrow them
                                and breake them in peeces, with much more following. </p>

                                <p>The second kinde of expolition is, when we speake one thing with
                                    many changes, which as some Authours do teach, consisteth of
                                    seven parts: and what these parts be, this example now following
                                    doth shewe. Whereby the Authour to Herenius teacheth verie
                                    plainly the whole reason of publishing, thus: A wise man will
                                    shunne no perill for the common wealth. Therefore as oft times
                                    it commeth to passe, that when he which will not die for the
                                    common wealth, doth of necessitie die with it. And because all
                                    commodities are received of the country, no discommoditie ought
                                    to be esteemed great or greevous for the country, wherefore they
                                    do unwisely which shun ye perill which must needs be bidden for
                                    the country: for neither can they avoyd the discommodities, and
                                    against their own Cittie they are found unthankfull. But they
                                    which with their own perill do willingly resist the perils of
                                    their country, are judged wise men, for that they both render
                                    that honour to the common wealth which they owe unto it, and had
                                    also rather die for many, than with many. </p>
                                <p>For it is a verie unreasonable thing to restore life received of
                                    nature, to nature when she compelleth, and not to give it to thy
                                    country when she craveth it: forasmuch as thou hast by thy
                                    countrey preserved it, and when thou maist with great vertue and
                                    honour die for thy ocuntry, to choose rather to live by
                                    dishonour and cowardnesse, and where as thou canst be content to
                                    put thy selfe in daunger for thy friends parents, and the rest
                                    of thy kinsfolk, to be unwilling to enter into danger for the
                                    common wealth, in which both this and that most reverende name
                                    of countrey is contained. Therefore as he is worthie to be
                                    contemned, which in failing had rather save himselfe then the
                                    shippe, so is he worthie to be balmed, which in jeopardie of the
                                    common wealth provideth more for his private safetie then for
                                    the common preservation. From a broken ship many have escaped
                                    from the shipwrack of the ocuntry no man can well escape: which
                                    me thinke Decius did well perceive, who as it is reported,
                                    bending himselfe to die for the safetie of his souldiers, ranne
                                    into the middest of his enemies, whereby he let his life go, but
                                    lost it not: for with a thing of smal value, he redeeme a thing
                                    of great price: he gave his life, he gained his countrey: he
                                    parted with his life, he obtained glory: which published with
                                    high praise, the elder it waxeth, the more &amp; more it shall
                                    shine. </p>

                                <p>Now forasmuch as it is shewed by reason, and proved by example,
                                    that we ought to venture our lives for the common wealth, those
                                    men are to judged wise, which shun no perill for the safetie of
                                    their country. </p>
                                <p>Now albeit the Author hath given this example, yet an Orator is
                                    not alwaies so straitly bound, as to observe everie point
                                    hereof: but hath a larger libertie to use it, as it may seeme

                            <p>1. If some good man for the love of justice and pittie of his
                                countrey should take upon him to reprehend a tirant, and to remove
                                him from his crueltie, to an equitie and mildnesse of government, he
                                should venture upon a verie dangerous enterprise, more likelie to
                                loose his life, then obtaine his purpose, as often experience hath

                                delivered. For Kinges and tirants which are mightie, are not wont,
                                or can hardly heare their faultes and wickednesse, which they commit

                                enterprise in hand must doo it with a<note place="marg"
                                    anchored="false">This was wel observed of Nathan.</note> cunning
                                shadow of speech, and not in the sight of the Sunne, I meane not
                                openly and plainlie: for the naked truth doth often offend in a
                                naked tale.<note place="marg" anchored="false">2. Samuel. 12.</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>The Orators speech may be shadowed two manner of waies, either by
                                reproving another person, in whom the same evils are, or were in,
                                while he lived: or by commending such persons in whom the contraries
                                are. If a man should in the respect of reprehension speake to
                                Dionysius the king of Sicilia, hee might reprove the crueltie of
                                Phalaris, and by an artificiall description and reprehension of that
                                creltie and tirannie in Phalaris, he may make a most bright and
                                resplendent glasse wherein Dionysius must needes behold himselfe and
                                his deformed tirannie. </p>
                            <p>Or if a man shall commend and highly praise those Princes and Kinges
                                which have done the contrarie, I meane, which have goverened by
                                wisedome, equitie, moderation and mercie. An evill man hearing the
                                praises, and glorious fame of others, is moved in mind, and begins
                                to covet commendation and praise, and seeing it cannot be obtained
                                onely by desire, hee enclineth to the meanes by which he may deserve
                                it. </p>
                            <p>For modesties sake, thus: whose mother is delighted with daily
                                mariages, signifying hereby her unchast life. </p>
                            <p>The holy Scripture in this respect hath many examples, and chast
                                Phrases, which ought to be presidents to us as oft as we have
                                occasion to expresse or signifie matters which are bashfull &amp;
                                undecent to be plainly told. </p>

                            <p>Adam knew Eve his wife which conceived and bare Cain. </p>
                            <p>Thou shalt not be excellent because thou wenteth up to thy fathers
                                bed. Salomon observeth most seemly the chastitie of speech, where he
                                saith. Let her breastes alwaies satisfie thee, and hold ever content
                                with her love. And in the next verse: Why shouldest thou unbrace the
                                bosome of a stranger? </p>
                            <p>Herein nature it selfe also seemeth to prescribe this dutie, that
                                those thinges, which she hideth, mans owne reverence ought to keepe
                                secret. </p>
                            <p>3. To delight the hearer by the grace of shadowed speech is very
                                usuall among pleasant wittes and apt conceites: and therefore I
                                judge it needlesse to exemplifie this part. Concerning the use and
                                caution of this figure there is alreadie sufficiently said. </p>

                                a sunder by the interposition of another, or thus: When a sentence
                                is cast betweene the speech before it be all ended, which although
                                it giveth some strength, yet being taken away, it leaveth the same
                                speech perfect enough. </p>
                            <p>An example of Esay: At that time all vineyardes, (though there were a
                                thousand vines in one, &amp; sold for a thousand silverlings) shalbe
                                turned into briers and thornes. </p>

                            <p>Another of the Apostle Paul: They are the ministers of Christ (I
                                speake as a foole) I am more, &amp; c. </p>

                                <p>A <term>Parenthesis</term> is often put in, when the speaker
                                    supposing that the hearer may demaund a reason, or make an
                                    objection to that which he saith, preventeth him by an
                                    interposition expressed before the sentence be all ended, so
                                    that hereby it may appeare that a <term>Parenthesis</term>
                                    serveth to confirme the saying by the interposition of a reason,
                                    and to confute the objection by the timely prevention of an
                                    answere: Also where the sentence may seeme darke or doubtfull,
                                    it putteth in a short annotation or exposition to give light and
                                    to resolve the doubt. </p>

                                <p><term>Parentheses</term> if they be verie long they cause
                                    obscuritie of the sense, and sometime confusion of former and
                                    matter, in so much that the speaker forgetting the former part
                                    of ye sentence knoweth not what the latter should be Also a
                                    needlesse interposition is like unprofitable houshold stuffe
                                    that filleth roome but doth no service: or like to the
                                    Missletoe, which albeit it standeth in the tree, and liveth by
                                    his juice, yet is neither of the like nature, nor beareth the
                                    like frute. </p>
