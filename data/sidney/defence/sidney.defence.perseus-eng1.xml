<p>When the right vertuous <name rend="italic">E. W.</name> and I were
at the Emperours Court togither, wee gaue our selues to learne
horsemanship of <name rend="italic">Ion Pietro Pugliano, </name> one
that with great commendation had the place of an Esquire in his
stable: and hee according to the fertilnes of the Italian wit, did not
onely affoord vs the demonstration of his practise, but sought to
enrich our mindes with the contemplations therein, which he thought
most precious. But with none I remember mine eares were at any time
more loaden, then when (either angred with slow paiment, or mooued
with our learnerlike admiration) hee exercised his speech in the
praise of his facultie. He said souldiers were the noblest estate of
mankind, and horsemen the noblest of souldiers. He said they were the
maisters of warre, and ornaments of peace, speedie goers, and strong
abiders, triumphers both in Camps and Courts:  nay to so vnbleeued a
point he proceeded, as that no earthly thing bred such wonder to a
Prince, as to be a good horseman.  Skill of gouernment was but a
<foreign xml:lang="lat">Pedanteria, </foreign> in comparison, then would he
adde certaine praises by telling what a peerlesse beast the horse was,
the onely seruiceable Courtier without flattery, the beast of most
bewtie, faithfulnesse, courage, and such more, that if I had not bene
a peece of a <name rend="italic">Logician</name> before I came to him,
I thinke he would haue perswaded me to haue wished my selfe a horse.
But thus much at least, with his no few words he draue into me, that
selfeloue is better then any guilding, to make that seem gorgious
wherin our selues be parties.
</p>


<p>Wherin if <name rend="italic">Pulianos</name> strong affection and weake arguments
will not satisfie you, I wil giue you a nearer example
of my selfe, who I know not by what mischance in
these my not old yeares and idlest times, hauing slipt
into the title of a Poet, am prouoked to say somthing
vnto you in the defence of that my vnelected vocation, which if I handle with more good will, then
good reasons beare with me, since the scholler is to
be pardoned that followeth the steps of his maister.
And yet I must say, that as I haue more iust cause to
make a pittifull defence of poore <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>, which
from almost the highest estimation of learning, is
falne to be the laughing stocke of children, so haue
I need to bring some more auaileable proofes, since
the former is by no man bard of his deserued credit,
the silly later, hath had euen the names of <name rend="italic">Philosophers, </name> vsed to the defacing of it, with great daunger
of ciuill warre among the Muses.
</p>

<p>And first truly to
all them that professing learning enuey against Poetrie, may iustly be obiected, that they go very neare
to vngratefulnesse, to seeke to deface that which in
the noblest nations and languages that are knowne,
hath bene the first light giuer to ignorance, and first
nurse whose milke litle by litle enabled them to feed
afterwards of tougher knowledges. And will you
play the Hedge-hogge, that being receiued into the
den, draue out his host?  Or rather the Vipers, that
with their birth kill their parents?  Let learned <name rend="italic">Greece</name>
in any of his manifold Sciences, be able to shew me
one booke before <name rend="italic">Musæus</name>, <name rend="italic">Homer</name>, &amp; <name rend="italic">Hesiod</name>, all three
nothing else but Poets. Nay let any Historie bee
brought, that can say any writers were there before
them, if they were not men of the same skill, as <name rend="italic">Orpheus</name>, <name rend="italic">Linus</name>,
and some other are named, who hauing
bene the first of that country that made pennes deliuerers of their knowledge to the postertie,
nay iustly challenge to bee called their Fathers in learning.
For not onely in time they had this prioritie, (although in it selfe antiquitie be venerable) but went
before them, as causes to draw with their charming
sweetnesse the wild vntamed wits to an admiration
of knowledge. So as <name rend="italic">Amphion</name>, was said to mooue
stones with his Poetry, to build <name rend="italic">Thebes</name>, and <name rend="italic">Orpheus</name>
to be listned to by beasts, indeed stonie and beastly
people.
</p>

<p>So among the <name rend="italic"> Romans</name>, were <name rend="italic">Liuius Andronicus</name>,
and <name rend="italic">Ennius</name>, so in the Italian language, the first
that made it aspire to be a treasure-house of Science,
were the Poets <name rend="italic">Dante</name>, <name rend="italic">Bocace</name>, and <name rend="italic">Petrach. </name>  So in our
English, were <name rend="italic">Gower</name>, and <name rend="italic">Chawcer</name>, after whom,
encoraged &amp; delighted with their excellent foregoing,
others haue folowed to bewtify our mother toong,
aswel in the same kind as other arts.
</p>

<p>This did so notably shew it self, thatt the <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name>
of <name rend="italic">Greece</name> durst not a
long time apear to ye world, but vnder ye mask of poets. So <name rend="italic">Thales</name>,
<name rend="italic">Empedocles</name>, and <name rend="italic">Parmenides</name>, sang their naturall
Philosophie in verses. So did <name rend="italic">Pithagoras</name> and
<name rend="italic">Phocillides</name>, their morall Councels.  So did <name rend="italic">Tirteus</name> in
warre matters, and <name rend="italic">Solon</name> in matters of pollicie, or rather
they being Poets, did exercise their delightfull
vaine in those points of highest knowledge, which
before them laie hidden to the world.  For, that wise
<name rend="italic">Solon</name> was directly a Poet, it is manifest, hauing writ-
ten in verse the notable Fable of the <name rend="italic">Atlantick</name> Iland,
which was continued by <name rend="italic">Plato</name>.  And truely euen <name rend="italic">Plato</name>
who so euer well considereth, shall finde that in
the body of his worke though the inside &amp; strength
were Philosophie, the skin as it were and beautie,
depended most of Poetrie. For all stands vpon Dialogues, wherein hee faines many honest Burgesses
of <name rend="italic">Athens</name> speak of such matters, that if they had bene
set on the Racke, they would neuer haue confessed
them:  besides his Poeticall describing the circumstances of their meetings, as the well ordering of a
banquet, the delicacie of a walke, with enterlacing
meere Tales, as <title>Gyges Ring</title> and others, which, who
knowes not to bee flowers of Poetrie, did neuer
walke into <name rend="italic">Appollos</name> Garden.
</p>

<p>And euen <name rend="italic">Historiographers</name>, although their lippes sound of things done,
and veritie be written in their forehead, haue bene
glad to borrow both fashion and perchance weight
of the Poets. So <name rend="italic">Herodotus</name> entituled his Historie, by
the name of the nine Muses, and both he and all the
rest that followed him, either stale, or vsurped of
Poetrie, their passionate describing of passions, the
many particularities of battels which no man could
affirme, or if that be denied me, long Orations put
in the mouthes of great Kings and Captains, which
it is certaine they neuer pronounced. So that truly
neither <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name>, nor <name rend="italic">Historiographer</name>, could at the
first haue entered into the gates of populer iudgements, if they had not taken a great pasport
of Poetrie, which in all nations at this day where learning
flourisheth not, is plaine to be seene:  in all which,
they haue some feeling of Poetry.
</p>

<p>In <name rend="italic">Turkey</name>, besides
their lawgiuing Diuines, they haue no other writers but Poets. In our neighbour Countrey <name rend="italic">Ireland</name>,
where truly learning goes verie bare, yet are their
Poets held in a deuout reuerence. Euen among the
most barbarous and simple <name rend="italic">Indians</name>, where no writing is, yet haue they their Poets who make &amp; sing
songs which they call <name rend="italic">Arentos</name>, both of their Auncestors deeds, and praises of their Gods. A sufficient
probability, that if euer learning come among them,
it must be by hauing their hard dull wittes softened
and sharpened with the sweete delights of Poetrie,
for vntill they finde a pleasure in the exercise of the
minde, great promises of much knowledge, wil little persuade them that know not the
frutes of knowledge. In <name rend="italic">Wales</name>, the true remnant of the auncient
<name rend="italic">Brittons</name>, as there are good authorities to shew, the
long time they had Poets which they called <name rend="italic">Bardes: </name>
so thorow all the conquests of <name rend="italic">Romans</name>, <name rend="italic">Saxons</name>, <name rend="italic">Danes</name>,
and <name rend="italic">Normans</name>, some of whom, did seeke to ruine all
memory of learning from among them, yet do their
Poets euen to this day last:  so as it is not more notable in the soone beginning, then in long continuing.
</p>

<p>But since the Authors of most of our Sciences,
were the <name rend="italic">Romanes</name>, and before them the <name rend="italic">Greekes</name>, let vs
a litle stand vpon their authorities, but euen so farre
as to see what names they haue giuen vnto this now
scorned skill.  Among the <name rend="italic">Romanes</name> a Poet was called
<foreign xml:lang="lat">Vates</foreign>, which is as much as a diuiner, foreseer, or
Prophet, as by his conioyned words <foreign xml:lang="lat">Vaticinium</foreign>,
and <foreign xml:lang="lat">Vaticinari</foreign>, is manifest, so heauenly a title did
that excellent people bestowe vppon this hart-rauishing knowledge, and so farre were they
carried into the admiration thereof, that they thought
in the chanceable hitting vppon any of such verses, great foretokens of their following fortunes,
were placed. Whereupon grew the world of <foreign xml:lang="lat">Sortes Vergilianae</foreign>,
when by suddaine opening <name rend="italic">Virgils</name>
booke, they lighted vppon some verse of his, as it
is reported by many, whereof the Histories of the
<name rend="italic">Emperours</name> liues are full. As of <name rend="italic">Albinus</name> the Gouernour
of our Iland, who in his childhood met
with this verse <foreign xml:lang="lat">Arma amens capio, nec sat rationis in armis: </foreign> and in his age performed it, although
it were a verie vaine and godlesse superstition, as
also it was, to thinke spirits were commaunded by
such verses, whereupon this word <name rend="italic">Charmes</name> deriued
of <foreign xml:lang="lat">Carmina, </foreign> commeth:  so yet serueth it to shew
the great reuerence those wittes were held in, and
altogither not without ground, since both by the
Oracles of <name rend="italic">Delphos</name> and <name rend="italic">Sybillas</name> prophesies, were
wholly deliuered in verses, for that same exquisite
obseruing of number and measure in the words,
and that high flying libertie of conceit propper to
the Poet, did seeme to haue some diuine force in it.
</p>

<p>And may not I presume a little farther, to shewe the
reasonablenesse of this word <foreign xml:lang="lat">Vatis, </foreign> and say that the
holy <name rend="italic">Dauids</name> Psalms are a diuine <name rend="italic">Poeme?</name> If I do, I shal
not do it without the testimony of great learned men
both auncient and moderne.  But euen the name of
Psalmes wil speak for me, which being interpreted,
is nothing but Songs:  then that it is fully written in
meeter as all learned <name rend="italic">Hebritians</name> agree, although the
rules be not yet fully found. Lastly and principally,
his handling his prophecie, which is meerly Poeticall. For what else is the awaking his musical
Instruments, the often and free chaunging of persons, his
notable <foreign>Prosopopeias</foreign>, when he maketh you as it were
see God comming in his maiestie, his telling of the
beasts ioyfulnesse, and hils leaping, but a heauenly
poesie, wherin almost he sheweth himselfe a passionate louer of that vnspeakable and euerlasting bewtie,
to be seene by the eyes of the mind, onely cleared
by faith? But truly now hauing named him, I feare I
seeme to prophane that holy name, applying it to
<name rend="italic">Poetry</name>, which is among vs throwne downe to so
ridiculous an estimation. But they that with quiet
iudgements wil looke a litle deeper into it, shal find
the end &amp; working of it such, as being rightly applied, deserueth not to be scourged out of the Church
of God.
</p>

<p>But now let vs see how the Greekes haue
named it, and how they deemed of it. The Greekes
named him <foreign xml:lang="grc">poih/thn</foreign> which name, hath as the most excellent, gone through other languages, it commeth
of this word <foreign xml:lang="grc">poiei=n</foreign> which is to make:  wherin I know
not whether by luck or wisedome, we Englishmen
haue met with the Greekes in calling him Maker.
Which name, how high and incomparable a title it
is, I had rather were knowne by marking the scope
of other sciences, then by any partial allegation. There
is no Art deliuered vnto mankind that hath not the
workes of nature for his principall obiect, without
which they could not consist, and on which they so
depend, as they become Actors &amp; Plaiers, as it were
of what nature will haue set forth. So doth the <name rend="italic">Astronomer</name> looke vpon the starres, and by that he seeth
set downe what order nature hath taken therein.  So
doth the <name rend="italic">Geometritian</name> &amp; <name rend="italic">Arithmititian, </name>in their diuers
sorts of quantities. So doth the <name rend="italic">Musitians</name> in times tel
you, which by nature agree, which not.  The natural <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name> thereon hath his name, and
the morall <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name> standeth vppon the naturall vertues,
vices, or passions of man:  and follow nature saith he
therein, and thou shalt not erre. The <name rend="italic">Lawier</name> saith,
what men haue determined. The <name rend="italic">Historian</name>, what
men haue done. The <name rend="italic">Gramarian</name>, speaketh onely of
the rules of speech, and the <name rend="italic">Rhetoritian</name> and <name rend="italic">Logitian</name>, considering
what in nature wil soonest prooue,
and perswade thereon, giue artificiall rules, which
still are compassed within the circle of a question, according to the proposed matter. The <name rend="italic">Phisitian</name> wayeth
the nature of mans bodie, &amp; the nature of things
helpfull, or hurtfull vnto it. And the <name rend="italic">Metaphisicke</name>
though it be in the second &amp; abstract Notions, and
therefore be counted supernaturall, yet doth hee indeed build vpon the depth of nature.
</p>

<p>Only the <name rend="italic">Poet</name>
disdeining to be tied to any such subiection, lifted vp
with the vigor of his own inuention, doth grow in
effect into an other nature:  in making things either
better then nature bringeth foorth, or quite a new,
formes such as neuer were in nature:  as the <name rend="italic">Heroes</name>,
<name rend="italic">Demigods</name>, <name rend="italic"> Cyclops</name>, <name rend="italic"> Chymeras</name>, <name rend="italic"> Furies</name>, and such like; so
as he goeth hand in hand with nature, not enclosed
within the narrow warrant of her gifts, but freely
raunging within the Zodiack of his owne wit.  Nature neuer set foorth the earth in so rich Tapistry as
diuerse Poets haue done, neither with so pleasaunt
riuers, fruitfull trees, sweete smelling flowers, nor
whatsoeuer els may make the too much loued earth
more louely:  her world is brasen, the Poets only deliuer a golden.
</p>

<p>But let those things alone and goe to
man, for whom as the other things are, so it seemeth
in him her vttermost comming is imploied:  &amp; know
whether she haue brought foorth so true a louer as
<name rend="italic">Theagenes</name>, so constant a friend as <name rend="italic">Pylades</name>, so valiant a
man as <name rend="italic">Orlando</name>, so right a Prince as <name rend="italic">Xenophons Cyrus</name>,
so excellent a man euery way as <name rend="italic">Virgils Aeneas</name>.  Neither let this be iestingly conceiued, bicause the works
of the one be essenciall, the other in imitation or fiction:  for euerie vnderstanding, knoweth the skill
of ech Artificer standeth in that <name rend="italic"> Idea</name>, or fore conceit
of the worke, and not in the worke it selfe.  And that
the Poet hath that <name rend="italic">Idea</name>, is manifest, by deliuering
them foorth in such excellencie as he had imagined
them:  which deliuering foorth, also is not wholly
imaginatiue, as we are wont to say by them  that build
Castles in the aire:  but so farre substancially it worketh, not onely to make a <name rend="italic">Cyrus</name>, which had bene but
a particular excellency as nature might haue done,
but to bestow a <name rend="italic">Cyrus</name> vpon the world to make
many <name rend="italic">Cyrusses</name>, if they will learne aright, why and how
that maker made him. Neither let it be deemed too
sawcy a comparison, to ballance the highest point of
mans wit, with the efficacie of nature:  but rather
giue right honor to the heauenly maker of that maker, who hauing made man to his owne likenes, set
him beyond and ouer all the workes of that second
nature, which in nothing he sheweth so much as in
Poetry ; when with the force of a diuine breath, he
bringeth things foorth surpassing her doings:  with
no small arguments to the incredulous of that first
accursed fall of <name rend="italic">Adam</name>, since our erected wit maketh
vs know what perfection  is, and yet our infected will
keepeth vs from reaching vnto it.
</p>

<p>But these arguments
will by few be vnderstood, and by fewer graunted:
thus much I hope wil be giuen me, that the Greeks
with some probability of reason, gaue him the name
aboue all names of learning. Now let vs goe to a
more ordinarie opening of him, that the truth may
be the more palpable:  and so I hope though we get
not so vnmatched a praise as the <name rend="italic">Etimologie</name> of his
names will graunt, yet his verie description which
no man will denie, shall not iustly be barred from
a principall commendation. <name rend="italic">Poesie</name> therefore, is an
Art of <name rend="italic">Imitation: </name> for so <name rend="italic">Aristotle</name> termeth it in the
word <foreign xml:lang="grc">mi/mhsis, </foreign> that is to say, a representing, counterfeiting, or figuring forth to speake Metaphorically. A
speaking  <name rend="italic">Picture, </name>with this end to teach and delight.
</p>

<p>Of this haue bene three generall kindes, the chiefe
both in antiquitie and excellencie, were they that
did imitate the vnconceiueable excellencies of God.
Such were <name rend="italic">Dauid</name> in his Psalmes, <name rend="italic">Salomon</name> in his song
of songs, in his <name rend="italic">Ecclesiastes</name> and <name rend="italic">Prouerbes. Moses</name>
and <name rend="italic">Debora</name>, in their Hymnes, and the wryter of
<name rend="italic">Iobe: </name>  Which beside other, the learned <name rend="italic">Emanuell, </name>
<name rend="italic">Tremelius</name>, and <name rend="italic">F.  Iunius</name>, doo entitle the Poeticall
part of the scripture:  against these none will speake
that hath the holie Ghost in due holie reuerence.  In
this kinde, though in a full wrong diuinitie, were
<name rend="italic">Orpheus</name>, <name rend="italic"> Amphion</name>, <name rend="italic"> Homer</name> in his himnes,
and manie other both <name rend="italic">Greeke</name> and <name rend="italic">Romanes</name>. And
this <name rend="italic">Poesie</name> must be vsed by whosoeuer will follow <name rend="italic">S.  Paules</name>
counsaile, in singing Psalmes when they are mery,
and I knowe is vsed with the frute of comfort by
some, when in sorrowfull panges of their death
bringing sinnes, they finde the consolation of the
neuer leauing goodnes.
</p>

<p>The second kinde, is of
them that deale with matters Philosophicall, either
morall as <name rend="italic">Tirteus</name>, <name rend="italic">Phocilides</name>, <name rend="italic">Cato</name>;
or naturall, as <name rend="italic">Lucretius, </name> and <name rend="italic">Virgils Georgikes</name>; or Astronomicall
as <name rend="italic">Manilius</name> and <name rend="italic">Pontanus</name>; or Historicall as  <name rend="italic">Lucan: </name> which
who mislike the fault, is in their iudgement quite
out of tast, &amp; not in the sweet food of sweetly vttered knowledge.  But bicause this second sort is wrapped
within the folde of the proposed subiect, and
takes not the free course of his own inuention, whether they properly bee Poets or no, let <name rend="italic">Gramarians</name>
dispute; and goe to the third indeed right Poets, of
whom chiefly this question ariseth:  betwixt whom
and these second, is such a kinde of difference, as
betwixt the meaner sort of Painters, who counterfeyt onely such faces as are set before them, and
the more excelent, who hauing no law but wit, bestow that in colours vpon you, which is fittest for
the eye to see, and the constant, though lamenting
looke of <name rend="italic">Lucretia</name>, when shee punished in her
selfe anothers faulte:  wherein hee painteth not
<name rend="italic">Lucretia</name> whom he neuer saw, but painteth the outward bewty of such a vertue. For these third be they
which most properly do imitate to teach &amp; delight:
and to imitate, borrow nothing of what is, hath bin,
or shall be, but range onely reined with learned discretion, into the diuine consideration of what may
be and should be. These be they that as the first and
most noble sort, may iustly be termed <foreign xml:lang="lat">Vates: </foreign>  so these
are waited on in the excellentest languages and best
vnderstandings, with the fore described name of Poets.  For these indeed do meerly make to imitate, and
imitate both to delight &amp; teach, and delight to moue
men to take that goodnesse in hand, which without
delight they would flie as from a stranger; and teach
to make them know that goodnesse wherunto they
are moued: which being the noblest scope to which
euer any learning was directed, yet want there not
idle tongues to barke at them.
</p>

<p>These be subdiuided
into sundry more speciall denominations. The most
notable be the <name rend="italic">Heroick</name>, <name rend="italic"> Lyrick</name>,
<name rend="italic"> Tragick</name>, <name rend="italic"> Comick</name>, <name rend="italic"> Satyrick</name>, <name rend="italic"> Iambick</name>,
<name rend="italic"> Elegiack</name>, <name rend="italic"> Pastorall</name>, and certaine others:
some of these being tearmed according to the matter they deale with, some by the sort of verse they liked
best to write in, for indeed the greatest part of
Poets, haue apparelled their poeticall inuentions, in
that numbrous kind of writing which is called <name rend="italic">vers. </name>
Indeed but apparelled verse:  being but an ornament
and no cause to <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>, since there haue bene many
most excellent <name rend="italic">Poets</name> that neuer versefied, and now
swarme many versefiers that need neuer answere to
the name of <name rend="italic">Poets</name>. For <name rend="italic">Xenophon</name> who did imitate so
excellently as to giue vs <foreign xml:lang="lat">effigiem iusti imperii</foreign>, the
pourtraiture of a iust Empyre vnder the name of <name rend="italic">Cyrus</name>,
as <name rend="italic">Cicero</name> saith of him, made therein an absolute
heroicall Poeme. So did <name rend="italic">Heliodorus</name>, in his sugred inuention
of that picture of loue in <name rend="italic">Theagenes</name> &amp; <name rend="italic">Chariclea</name>, and
yet both these wrote in prose, which I
speake to shew, that it is not ryming and versing that
maketh a Poet, (no more then a long gown maketh
an Aduocate, who though he pleaded in Armour,
should be an Aduocat and no souldier) but it is that
faining notable images of vertues, vices, or what els,
with that delightfull teaching, which must be the
right describing note to know a Poet by. Although
indeed the Senate of Poets hath chosen verse as their
fittest raiment:  meaning as in matter, they passed  all
in all, so in maner, to go beyond them:  not speaking
table talke fashion, or like men in a dreame, words
as they chanceably fall from the mouth, but peasing
each sillable of eache word by iust proportion, according to the dignitie of the subiect.
</p>

<p>Now therfore
it shal not be amisse, first to way this latter sort of poetrie by his workes, and then by his parts, and if in
neither of these Anatomies hee be condemnable, I
hope we shall obteine a more fauourable sentence.
This purifying of wit, this enriching of memorie,
enabling of iudgement, and enlarging of conceit,
which commonly we cal learning, vnder what name
so euer it come forth, or to what immediate end soeuer it be directed, the finall end is, to lead and draw
vs to as high a perfection, as our degenerate soules
made worse by their clay-lodgings, can be capable
of. This according to the inclination of man, bred
many formed impressions. For some that thought
this felicity principally to be gotten by knowledge,
and no knowledge to be so high or heauenly, as acquaintance with the stars; gaue themselues
to <name rend="italic">Astronomie: </name> others perswading themselues to be <name rend="italic">Demygods</name>,
if they knew the causes of things, became naturall
and supernaturall <name rend="italic">Philosophers. </name>  Some an admirable
delight drew to <name rend="italic">Musicke</name>; and some the certaintie of
demonstration to the <name rend="italic">Mathematicks: </name> but all one and
other hauing this scope to know, &amp; by knowledge
to lift vp the minde from the dungeon of the bodie,
to the enioying his owne diuine essence. But when
by the ballance of experience it was found, that the
<name rend="italic">Astronomer</name> looking to the stars might fall in a ditch,
that the inquiring <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name> might be blind in him
self, &amp; the <name rend="italic">Mathematician</name>, might draw forth a straight
line with a crooked hart. Then lo did proofe, the ouerruler of opinions make manifest, that all these are
but seruing sciences; which as they haue a priuate
end in themselues, so yet are they all directed to the
highest end of the mistresse knowledge by ye Greeks
<foreign xml:lang="grc">a)rxitektoni/kh</foreign>
which stands as I thinke, in the knowledge
of a mans selfe, in the Ethike and Politique consideration, with the end of well doing, and not of well
knowing onely.
</p>

<p>Euen as the Sadlers next ende is to
make a good Saddle, but his further ende, to serue a
nobler facultie, which is horsmanship, so the horsemans to souldiery:  and the souldier not onely to haue
the skill, but to performe the practise of a souldier.
So that the ending end of all earthly learning, being
verteous action, those skils that most serue to bring
forth that, haue a most iust title to be Princes ouer al
the rest: wherin if we can shew, the Poet is worthy to
haue it before any other competitors:  among whom
principally to challenge it, step forth the moral <name rend="italic">Philosophers, </name> whom me thinkes I see comming towards
me, with a sullain grauitie, as though they could not
abide vice by day-light, rudely cloathed, for to witnesse outwardly their contempt of outward things,
with bookes in their hands against glorie, whereto
they set their names:  sophistically speaking against
subtiltie, and angry with any man in whom they see
the foule fault of anger. These men casting larges as
they go of definitions, diuitions, and distinctions,
with a scornful interrogatiue, do soberly aske, whether it be possible to find any path so ready to lead a
man to vertue, as that which teacheth what vertue
is, &amp; teacheth it not only by deliuering forth his very being, his causes and effects, but also by making
knowne his enemie vice, which must be destroyed,
and his combersome seruant passion, which must be
mastred:  by shewing the generalities that contains
it, and the specialities that are deriued from it.
</p>

<p>Lastly by plaine setting downe, how it extends it selfe out
of the limits of a mans owne little world, to the gouernment of families, and mainteining of publike
societies. The <name rend="italic">Historian</name> scarsely giues leisure to the
<name rend="italic">Moralist</name> to say so much, but that he loaden with old
Mouse-eaten Records, authorising himselfe for the
most part vpon other Histories, whose greatest authorities are built vppon the notable foundation
<name rend="italic">Heresay, </name> hauing much ado to accord differing writers, &amp; to pick truth out of partiality:
better acquainted with a 1000 . yeres ago, then with the present age,
and yet better knowing how this world goes, then
how his owne wit runnes, curious for Antiquities,
and inquisitiue of Nouelties, a wonder to yoong
folkes, and a Tyrant in table talke;  denieth in a great
chafe, that any man for teaching of vertue, and vertues actions, is comparable to him.
I am <foreign xml:lang="lat">Testis temporum, lux veritatis, vita memoriae, magistra vitae, nuncia vetustatis. </foreign>
The <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name> saieth he, teacheth a disputatiue vertue, but I do an actiue. His
vertue is excellent in the dangerlesse <name rend="italic">Academy</name> of <name rend="italic">Plato</name>:  but mine
sheweth forth her honourable face in the battailes
of <name rend="italic">Marathon</name>, <name rend="italic"> Pharsalia</name>, <name rend="italic">Poietiers</name>, and <name rend="italic">Agincourt</name>.  Hee
teacheth vertue by certaine abstract considerations:
but I onely bid you follow the footing of them that
haue gone before you. Old aged experience, goeth
beyond the fine witted <name rend="italic">Philosopher: </name> but I giue the
experience of many ages.
</p>

<p>Lastly, if he make the song
Booke, I put the learners hand to the Lute, and if he
be the guide, I am the light. Then would he alleage
you innumerable examples, confirming storie by
stories, how much the wisest Senators and Princes,
haue bene directed by the credit of Historie, as <name rend="italic">Brutus, Alphonsus</name>
of <name rend="italic">Aragon</name>, (and who not if need be. )
At length, the long line of their disputation makes a
point in this, that the one giueth the precept, &amp; the
other the example. Now whom shall we find, since
the question standeth for the highest forme in the
schoole of learning to be moderator?  Truly as mee
seemeth, the Poet, and if not a moderator, euen the
man that ought to carry the title from them both:
&amp; much more from all other seruing sciences.
</p>

<p>Therfore compare we the <name rend="italic">Poet</name> with the <name rend="italic">Historian</name>, &amp; with
the morall <name rend="italic">Philosopher: </name> and if hee goe beyond them
both, no other humaine skill can match him. For as
for the diuine, with all reuerence it is euer to be excepted, not onely for hauing his scope as far beyond
any of these, as Eternitie exceedeth a moment:  but
euen for passing ech of these in themselues. And for
the <name rend="italic">Lawier, </name> though <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ius</foreign> be the daughter of <name rend="italic">Iustice</name>, the
chiefe of vertues, yet because he seeks to make men
good, rather <foreign xml:lang="lat">formidine poenae, </foreign> then <foreign xml:lang="lat">virtutis amore: </foreign> or
to say righter, doth not endeuor to make men good,
but that their euill hurt not others, hauing no care
so he be a good citizen, how bad a man he be. Therfore as our wickednes maketh him necessarie, and
necessitie maketh him honorable, so is he not in the
deepest truth to stand in ranck with these, who al endeuour to take naughtinesse away, and plant
goodnesse euen in the secretest cabinet of our soules:  and
these foure are all that any way deale in the consideration of mens manners, which being the supreme
knowledge, they that best breed it, deserue the best
commendation. The <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name> therefore, and the
<name rend="italic">Historian</name>, are they which would win the goale, the
one by precept, the other by example:  but both, not
hauing both, doo both halt. For the <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name> set-
ting downe with thornie arguments, the bare rule,
is so hard of vtterance, and so mistie to be conceiued,
that one that hath no other guide but him, shall
wade in him till he be old, before he shall finde sufficient cause to be honest. For his knowledge
standeth so vpon the abstract and generall that happie is
that man who may vnderstand him, and more happie, that can apply what he doth vnderstand. On the
other side, the <name rend="italic">Historian</name> wanting the precept, is so
tied, not to what should be, but to what is, to the
particular truth of things, and not to the general reason of things, that his example draweth no
necessarie consequence, and therefore a lesse fruitfull doctrine.
</p>

<p>Now doth the peerlesse Poet performe both,
for whatsoeuer the <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name> saith should be done,
he giues a perfect picture of it by some one, by whom
he presupposeth it was done, so as he coupleth the
generall notion with the particuler example. A perfect picture I say, for hee yeeldeth to the powers of
the minde an image of that whereof the <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name>
bestoweth but a wordish description, which doth
neither strike, pearce, nor possesse, the sight of the
soule so much, as that other doth. For as in outward
things to a man that had neuer seene an <name rend="italic">Elephant</name>, or a
<name rend="italic">Rinoceros</name>, who should tell him most exquisitely all
their shape, cullour, bignesse, and particuler marks,
or of a gorgious pallace an <name rend="italic">Architecture</name>, who decla-
ring the full bewties, might well make the hearer able to repeat as it were by roat all he had heard, yet
should neuer satisfie his inward conceit, with being
witnesse to it selfe of a true liuely knowledge:  but
the same man, assoon as he might see those beasts wel
painted, or that house wel in modell, shuld straightwaies grow without need of any description to a
iudicial comprehending of them, so no doubt the <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name> with his learned definitions, be it of vertues
of vices, matters of publike policy or priuat gouernment, replenisheth the memorie with many infallible
grounds of wisdom, which notwithstanding lie
darke before the imaginatiue and iudging power, if
they be not illuminated or figured forth by the
speaking picture of <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>.
</p>

<p><name rend="italic">Tully</name> taketh much paines, and
many times not without Poeticall helpes to make vs
know the force, loue of our country hath in vs. Let
vs but heare old <name rend="italic">Anchices</name>, speaking in the middest of
<name rend="italic">Troies</name> flames, or see <name rend="italic">Vlisses</name> in the fulnesse of
all <name rend="italic">Calipsoes</name> delightes, bewaile his absence from barraine
and beggerly <name rend="italic">Ithecæ</name>. Anger the <name rend="italic">Stoickes</name> said, was a
short madnesse:  let but <name rend="italic">Sophocles</name> bring you <name rend="italic">Aiax</name> on
a stage, killing or whipping sheepe and oxen, thinking them the Army of Greekes, with their Chieftaines
<name rend="italic">Agamemnon</name>, and <name rend="italic">Menelaus: </name> and tell me if you
haue not a more familiar insight into Anger, then
finding in the schoolemen his <name rend="italic">Genus</name> and <name rend="italic">Difference</name>.
See whether wisdom and temperance in <name rend="italic">Vlisses</name> and
<name rend="italic">Diomedes</name>, valure in <name rend="italic">Achilles, </name> friendship in <name rend="italic">Nisus</name> and
<name rend="italic">Eurialus</name>, euen to an ignorant man carry not an apparant shining:  and contrarily, the remorse
of conscience in <name rend="italic">Oedipus</name>; the soone repenting pride in <name rend="italic">Agamemnon</name>; the
selfe deuouring crueltie in his father
<name rend="italic">Atreus</name> ; the violence of ambition in the two <name rend="italic">Theban</name>
brothers; the sower sweetnesse of reuenge in <name rend="italic">Medea</name>;
and to fall lower, the <name rend="italic">Terentian Gnato</name>, and our <name rend="italic">Chawcers Pander</name> so
exprest, that we now vse their names,
to signifie their Trades:  and finally, all vertues, vices, and passions, so in their owne naturall states,
laide to the view, that we seeme not to heare of
them, but clearly to see through them.
</p>

<p>But euen in the most excellent determination of goodnesse,
what <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name> counsaile can so readely
direct a Prince, as the feined <name rend="italic">Cirus</name> in <name rend="italic">Xenophon</name>,
or a vertuous man in all fortunes:  as <name rend="italic">Aeneas</name> in
<name rend="italic">Virgill</name>, or a whole Common-wealth, as the Way
of Sir Thomas Moores <name rend="italic">Eutopia</name>. I say the Way, because where Sir Thomas Moore erred, it was the
fault of the man and not of the Poet:  for that Way
of patterning a Common-wealth, was most absolute
though hee perchaunce hath not so absolutely
performed it. For the question is, whether the fained Image of Poetrie, or the reguler instruction
of Philosophie, hath the more force in teaching ?
Wherein if the <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name> haue more rightly shew-
ed themselues <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name> then the <name rend="italic">Poets</name>, haue atteined to the
high toppe of their profession(as in truth
<foreign xml:lang="lat">Mediocribus esse poetis non Dii, non homines, non concessere columnae</foreign>, ) it is (I say againe) not the fault of the
Art, but that by fewe men that Art can be accomplished. Certainly euen our Sauiour Christ could as
well haue giuen the morall comon places of vncharitablenesse and humblenesse, as the diuine
narration of <name rend="italic">Diues</name> and <name rend="italic">Lazarus</name>, or of disobedience and
mercy, as that heauenly discourse of the lost childe
and the gracious Father, but that his through searching wisdome, knew the estate of <name rend="italic">Diues</name> burning
in hell, and of <name rend="italic">Lazarus</name> in <name rend="italic">Abrahams</name> bosome, would
more constantly as it were, inhabit both the memorie and iudgement. Truly for my selfe(mee seemes)
I see before mine eyes, the lost childs disdainful prodigalitie, turned to enuy a Swines dinner:  which by
the learned <name rend="italic">Diuines</name> are thought not Historical acts,
but instructing Parables. For conclusion, I say the
<name rend="italic">Philosopher</name> teacheth, but he teacheth obscurely, so as
the learned onely can vnderstand him, that is to say,
he teacheth them that are alreadie taught.
</p>

<p>But the Poet is the food for the tendrest stomacks, the Poet
is indeed, the right populer <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name>. Whereof
<name rend="italic">Esops</name> Tales giue good proofe, whose prettie Allegories stealing vnder the formall Tales of beastes,
makes many more beastly then beasts:  begin to hear
the sound of vertue from those dumbe speakers.  But
now may it be alleadged, that if this imagining of
matters be so fit for the imagination, then must the
<name rend="italic">Historian</name> needs surpasse, who brings you images of
true matters, such as indeed were done, and not such
as fantastically or falsly may be suggested to haue bin
done. Truly <name rend="italic">Aristotle</name> himselfe in his discourse of <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>, plainly
determineth this question, saying, that <name rend="italic"> Poetrie</name> is
<foreign xml:lang="grc">filosophw/teron</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="grc">spoudaio/teron</foreign>,
that is to say, it is more
Philosophicall and more then History. His reason is,
because <name rend="italic">Poesie</name> dealeth with <foreign xml:lang="grc">kaqo/lou</foreign>, that is to say, with
the vniuersall consideration, and the Historie with
<foreign xml:lang="grc">kaq' e)/kaston</foreign>,
the particular. Now saith he, the vniuersall
wayes what is fit to be said or done, either in likelihood or necessitie,
which the <name rend="italic">Poesie</name> considereth in
his imposed names:  and the particular onely marketh whether <name rend="italic">Alcibiades</name> did or suffered this or that.
Thus farre <name rend="italic">Aristotle</name>. Which reason of his, as all his
is most full of reason.
</p>

<p>For indeed if the question were,
whether it were better to haue a particular act truly
or falsly set downe, there is no doubt which is to be
chosen, no more then whether you had rather haue
<name rend="italic">Vespacians</name> Picture right as he was, or at the Painters
pleasure nothing resembling. But if the question be
for your owne vse and learning, whether it be better to haue it set downe as it should be, or as it was ;
then certainly is more doctrinable, the fained <name rend="italic">Cyrus</name>
in <name rend="italic">Xenophon</name>, then the true <name rend="italic">Cyrus</name> in <name rend="italic">Iustin: </name> and the
fained <name rend="italic">Aeneas</name> in <name rend="italic">Virgill</name>,
then the right Aeneas in <name rend="italic">Dares Phrigius</name>:  as to a Ladie that desired to fashion her
countenance to the best grace:  a <name rend="italic">Painter</name> shuld more
benefite her to pourtrait a most sweete face, writing <name rend="italic">Canidia</name> vppon it,
then to paint <name rend="italic">Canidia</name> as shee
was, who <name rend="italic">Horace</name> sweareth was full ill fauoured. If
the <name rend="italic">Poet</name> do his part aright, he wil shew you in <name rend="italic">Tantalus Atreus</name>,
and such like, nothing that is not to
be shunned; in <name rend="italic">Cyrus</name>, <name rend="italic">Aeneas</name>, <name rend="italic">Vlisses</name>, each thing
to be followed:  where the <name rend="italic">Historian</name> bound to tell
things as things were, cannot be liberall, without
hee will be Poeticall of a perfect patterne, but as in
<name rend="italic">Alexander</name>, or <name rend="italic">Scipio</name> himselfe, shew doings, some to
be liked, some to be misliked; and then how wil you
discerne what to follow, but by your own discretion
which you had without reading <name rend="italic">Q.  Curtius. </name> And
whereas a man may say, though in vniuersall consideration of doctrine, the <name rend="italic">Poet</name> preuaileth, yet that the
Historie in his saying such a thing was done, doth
warrant a man more in that he shall follow. The answere is manifest, that if he stand vpon that was, as
if he should argue, because it rained yesterday, therfore it should raine to day, then indeede hath it
some aduantage to a grosse conceit. But if hee
knowe an example onely enformes a coniectured
likelihood, and so goe by reason, the <name rend="italic">Poet</name> doth so
farre exceed him, as hee is to frame his example
to that which is most reasonable, be it in warlike,
politike, or priuate matters, where the <name rend="italic">Historian</name> in
his bare, was, hath many times that which we call
fortune, to ouerrule the best wisedome. Manie
times he must tell euents, whereof he can yeeld no
cause, or if he do, it must be poetically.
</p>

<p>For that a fained example hath as much force to teach, as a true
example (for as for to mooue, it is cleare, since the
fained may be tuned to the highest key of passion)
let vs take one example wherein an <name rend="italic">Historian</name> and a
<name rend="italic">Poet</name> did concurre. <name rend="italic">Herodotus</name> and <name rend="italic">Iustin</name> doth both
testifie, that <name rend="italic">Zopirus</name>, King <name rend="italic">Darius</name> faithfull seruant,
seeing his maister long resisted by the rebellious <name rend="italic">Babilonians, </name> fained
himselfe in extreame disgrace of his
King, for verifying of which, he caused his owne
nose and eares to be cut off, and so flying to the
<name rend="italic">Babylonians</name> was receiued, and for his knowne valure so farre creadited, that hee did finde meanes
to deliuer them ouer to <name rend="italic">Darius</name>. Much like matter
doth <name rend="italic">Liuy</name> record of <name rend="italic">Tarquinius</name>, and his sonne.
<name rend="italic">Xenophon</name> excellently faineth such an other Stratageme,
performed by <name rend="italic">Abradates</name> in <name rend="italic">Cyrus</name> behalfe.
Now would I faine knowe, if occasion be presented vnto you, to serue your Prince by such an honest
dissimulation, why you do not as well learne
it of <name rend="italic">Xenophons</name> fiction, as of the others veritie:  and
truly so much the better, as you shall saue your nose
by the bargaine. For <name rend="italic">Abradates</name> did not coun-
terfeyt so farre.
</p>

<p>So then the best of the <name rend="italic">Historian</name>
is subiect to the <name rend="italic">Poet, </name> for whatsoeuer action or
faction, whatsoeuer counsaile, pollicie, or warre,
stratageme, the <name rend="italic">Historian</name> is bounde to recite, that
may the <name rend="italic">Poet</name> if hee list with his imitation make his
owne ; bewtifying it both for further teaching,
and more delighting as it please him:  hauing all
from <name rend="italic">Dante</name> his heuen to his hell, vnder the authority of
his pen. Which if I be asked what <name rend="italic">Poets</name> haue don for
as I might wel name some, so yet say I, and say again,
I speake of the Art and not of the Artificer.
</p>

<p>Now to that which commonly is attributed to the praise of
Historie, in respect of the notable learning, is got by
marking the successe, as though therein a man shuld
see vertue exalted, &amp; vice punished:  truly that commendation is peculier to Poetrie, and farre off from
Historie ; for indeed Poetrie euer sets vertue so out
in her best cullours, making fortune her well-wayting handmayd, that one must needs be enamoured
of her. Well may you see <name rend="italic">Vlisses</name> in a storme and in
other hard plights, but they are but exercises of patience &amp; magnanimitie, to make them shine the more
in the neare following prosperitie. And of the contrary part, if euill men come to the stage, they euer
goe out (as the Tragedie writer answered to one
that misliked the shew of such persons) so manicled
as they litle animate folkes to follow them. But the
Historie beeing captiued to the trueth of a foolish
world, is many times a terror from well-doing, and
an encouragement to vnbrideled wickednes. For
see we not valiant <name rend="italic">Milciades</name> rot in his fetters ?  The
iust <name rend="italic">Phocion</name> and the accomplished <name rend="italic">Socrates</name>, put to
death like Traytors?  The cruell <name rend="italic">Seuerus</name>, liue prosperously?
The excellent <name rend="italic">Seuerus</name> miserably murthered?  <name rend="italic">Sylla</name>
and <name rend="italic">Marius</name> dying in their beds?  <name rend="italic">Pompey</name>
and <name rend="italic">Cicero</name> slain then when they wold haue thought
exile happinesse?  See we not vertuous <name rend="italic">Cato</name> driuen
to kill himselfe, and Rebell <name rend="italic">Cæsar</name> so aduanced, that
his name yet after 1600 yeares lasteth in the highest honor?  And marke but euen <name rend="italic">Cæsars</name> owne words
of the forenamed <name rend="italic">Sylla</name>, (who in that onely, did
honestly to put downe his dishonest Tyrannie)  <foreign xml:lang="lat">Litteras nesciuit: </foreign> as if want of learning caused him to doo
well. He ment it not by Poetrie, which not content
with earthly plagues, deuiseth new punishments in
hell for Tyrants:  nor yet by Philosophy, which teacheth <foreign xml:lang="lat">Occidentos esse, </foreign> but no doubt by skill in History,
for that indeed can affoord you <name rend="italic">Cipselus</name>, <name rend="italic"> Periander</name>,
<name rend="italic">Phalaris</name>, <name rend="italic">Dionisius</name>, and I know not how many more
of the same kennell, that speed well inough in their
abhominable iniustice of vsurpation.
</p>

<p>I conclude therfore that he excelleth historie, not onely in furnishing the minde with knowledge, but in setting it
forward to that which deserues to be called and accounted good:  which setting forward and mouing
to well doing, indeed setteth the Lawrell Crowne
vpon the <name rend="italic">Poets</name> as victorious, not onely of the <name rend="italic">Historian</name>, but
ouer the <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name>, howsoeuer in teaching it may be questionable.
For suppose it be granted, that which I suppose with great reason may be
denied, that the <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name> in respect of his methodical proceeding,
teach more perfectly then the <name rend="italic">Poet</name>, yet do I thinke, that no man is
so much <foreign xml:lang="lat">philophilosothos, </foreign>
as to compare the <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name> in moouing with the
<name rend="italic">Poet. </name>  And that moouing is of a higher degree then
teaching, it may by this appeare, that it is well nigh
both the cause and effect of teaching. For who will
be taught, if hee be not mooued with desire to be
taught?  And what so much good doth that teaching
bring foorth, (I speake still of morall doctrine) as
that it mooueth one to do that which it doth teach.
</p>

<p>For as <name rend="italic">Aristotle</name> saith, it is not
<foreign xml:lang="grc">gnw/sis</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="grc">pra/cis</foreign> must be
the frute:  and how <foreign xml:lang="grc">pra/cis</foreign> can be without being
moued to practise, it is no hard matter to consider.  The
<name rend="italic">Philosopher</name> sheweth you the way, hee enformeth
you of the particularities, as well of the tediousnes
of the way, as of the pleasaunt lodging you shall
haue when your iourney is ended, as of the many by turnings that may diuert you from your way.
But this is to no man but to him that will reade
him, and reade him with attentiue studious painfulnesse, which constant desire, whosoeuer hath in
him, hath alreadie past halfe the hardnesse of the
way:  and therefore is beholding to the <name rend="italic">Philosopher, </name> but for the other halfe. Nat truly learned
men haue learnedly thought, that where once reason hath so much ouer-mastered passion, as that
the minde hath a free desire to doo well, the inward light each minde hath in it selfe, is as good
as a <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name> booke, since in Nature we know
it is well, to doo well, and what is well, and what
is euill, although not in the wordes of Art which
<name rend="italic">Philosophers</name> bestow vppon vs:  for out of naturall
conceit the <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name> drew it ; but to be moued
to doo that which wee know, or to be mooued
with desire to know. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Hoc opus, hic labor est. </foreign>
</p>

<p>Now therein of all Sciences I speake still of humane (and
according to the humane conceit) is our <name rend="italic">Poet</name> the
<name rend="italic">Monarch</name>. For hee doth not onely shew the way,
but giueth so sweete a prospect into the way, as
will entice anie man to enter into it:  Nay he doth
as if your iourney should lye through a faire vineyard, at the verie first, giue you a cluster of grapes,
that full of that taste, you may long to passe further. Hee beginneth not with obscure
definitions, which must blurre the margent with interpretations, and loade the memorie with
doubtfulnesse:  but hee commeth to you with words
set in delightfull proportion, either accompanied
with, or prepared for the well enchanting skill of
<name rend="italic">Musicke, </name> and with a tale forsooth he commeth vnto you, with a tale, which holdeth children from
play, and olde men from the Chimney corner ; and
pretending no more, doth intend the winning of the
minde from wickednes to vertue; euen as the child
is often brought to take most wholesome things by
hiding them in such other as haue a pleasaunt taste:
which if one should begin to tell them the nature of
the <name rend="italic">Alloes</name> or <name rend="italic">Rhabarbarum</name> they should receiue, wold
sooner take their phisick at their eares then at their
mouth, so is it in men (most of which, are childish
in the best things, til they be cradled in their graues)
glad they will be to heare the tales of <name rend="italic">Hercules, Achilles, Cyrus, Aeneas, </name> and hearing them, must needes
heare the right description of wisdom, value, and iustice; which if they had bene barely (that is to say
Philosophically) set out, they would sweare they be
brought to schoole againe ; that imitation whereof
<name rend="italic">Poetrie</name> is, hath the most conueniencie to nature of al
other:  insomuch that as <name rend="italic">Aristotle</name> saith, those things
which in themselues are horrible, as cruel battailes,
vnnatural monsters, are made in poeticall imitation,
delightfull.
</p>

<p>Truly I haue knowne men, that euen
with reading <name rend="italic">Amadis de gaule, </name> which God knoweth,
wanteth much of a perfect <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>, haue found their
hearts moued to the exercise of courtesie, liberalitie, and especially courage. Who
readeth <name rend="italic">Aeneas</name> carrying old <name rend="italic">Anchises</name> on his backe, that wisheth not
it were his fortune to performe so excellent an Act?
Whom doth not those words of <name rend="italic">Turnus</name> mooue,
(the Tale of <name rend="italic">Turnus</name> hauing planted his image in the
imagination) <foreign xml:lang="lat">fugientem haec terra videbit? Vsque adeone mori miserum est?</foreign> Wher
the <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name> as they think
scorne to delight, so must they be content little to
mooue ; sauing wrangling whether <foreign xml:lang="lat">Virtus</foreign> be the
chiefe or the onely good ; whether the contemplatiue or the actiue life do excell; which <name rend="italic">Plato &amp; Poetius</name>
well knew:  and therefore made mistresse <name rend="italic">Philosophie</name> verie often borrow the masking raiment of
<name rend="italic">Poesie</name>. For euen those hard hearted euill men who
thinke vertue a schoole name, and know no other
good but <foreign xml:lang="lat">indulgere genio</foreign>, and therefore despise the
austere admonitions of the <name rend="italic">Philosopher, </name> and feele not
the inward reason they stand vpon, yet will be content to be delighted, which is all the good, fellow
<name rend="italic">Poet</name> seemes to promise; and so steale to see the form
of goodnes, (which seene, they cannot but loue) ere
themselues be aware, as if they tooke a medicine of
Cheries.
</p>

<p>Infinit proofes of the straunge effects of
this Poeticall inuention, might be alleaged:  onely
two shall serue, which are so often remembred, as
I thinke all men know them. The one of <name rend="italic">Menemus</name>
<name rend="italic">Agrippa, </name> who when the whole people of <name rend="italic">Rome</name> had
resolutely diuided themselues from the <name rend="italic">Senate, </name> with
apparant shew of vtter ruine, though he were for
that time an excellent Orator, came not among them
vpon trust either of figuratiue speeches, or cunning
insinuations, and much lesse with farre fet <name rend="italic">Maximes</name>
of <name rend="italic">Philosophie, </name> which especially if they were <name rend="italic">Platonicke, </name> they
must haue learned <name rend="italic">Geometrie</name> before
they could well haue conceiued:  but forsooth, he
behaueth himselfe like a homely and familiar <name rend="italic">Poet</name>.
He telleth them a tale, that there was a time, when
all the parts of the bodie made a mutinous conspiracie against the belly, which they thought deuoured
the frutes of each others labour: they concluded
they would let so vnprofitable a spender starue. In
the end, to be short, for the tale is notorious, and as
notorious that it was a tale, with punishing the belly they plagued themselues ; this applied by him,
wrought such effect in the people, as I neuer red,
that onely words brought foorth:  but then so suddaine and so good an alteration, for vpon reasonable
conditions, a perfect reconcilement ensued. The other is of <name rend="italic">Nathan</name> the Prophet, who when the holie
<name rend="italic">Dauid</name>, had so farre forsaken God, as to confirme Adulterie with murther, when he was to do
the tendrest office of a friend, in laying his owne shame before his eyes; sent by God to call againe so chosen a
seruant, how doth he it?  but by telling of a man
whose beloued lambe was vngratefully taken from
his bosome. The Application most diuinely true,
but the discourse it selfe fained; which made <name rend="italic">Dauid</name>
(I speake of the second and instrumentall cause) as
in a glasse see his owne filthinesse, as that heauenly
Psalme of mercie well testifieth. By these therefore
examples and reasons, I thinke it may be manifest,
that the <name rend="italic">Poet</name> with that same hand of delight, doth
draw the mind more effectually then any other Art
doth.
</p>

<p>And so a conclusion not vnfitly ensue, that as
vertue is the most excell't resting place for al worldly learning to make his end of, so <name rend="italic">Poetry</name> being the
most familiar to teach it, and most Princely to moue
towards it, in the most excellent worke, is the most
excellent workeman. But I am content not onely
to decipher him by his workes (although workes
in commendation and dispraise, must euer hold a
high authoritie) but more narrowly will examine
his parts, so that  ( as in a man ) though altogither
may carrie a presence full of maiestie and bewtie,
perchance in some one defectuous peece we may
finde blemish.
</p>

<p>Now in his parts, kindes, or <foreign xml:lang="lat">species, </foreign> as you list to tearme them, it is to be noted,
that some <name rend="italic">Poesies</name> haue coupled togither two or three
kindes, as the <name rend="italic">Tragicall</name> and <name rend="italic">Comicall</name>, whereupon
is risen the <name rend="italic">Tragicomicall</name>, some in the maner haue
mingled prose and verse, as <name rend="italic">Sanazara</name> and <name rend="italic">Boetius;</name>
some haue mingled matters <name rend="italic">Heroicall</name> and <name rend="italic">Pastorall, </name>
but that commeth all to one in this question, for
if seuered they be good, the coniunction cannot
be hurtfull:  therefore perchance forgetting some,
and leauing some as needlesse to be remembred. It
shall not bee amisse, in a word to cite the speciall
kindes, to see what faults may be found in the right
vse of them. Is it then the Pastorall <name rend="italic">Poeme</name> which is
misliked ? (For perchance where the hedge is lowest they will soonest leape ouer) is the poore pipe
disdained, which somtimes out of <name rend="italic">Mælibeus</name> mouth,
can shewe the miserie of people, vnder hard Lords
and rauening souldiers?  And again by <name rend="italic">Titerus, </name> what
blessednesse is deriued, to them that lie lowest, from
the goodnesse of them that sit highest ? Sometimes
vnder the prettie tales of Woolues and sheepe, can
enclude the whole considerations of wrong doing
and patience; sometimes shew that contentions for
trifles, can get but a trifling victory, wher perchance
a man may see, that euen <name rend="italic">Alexander &amp; Darius</name>, when
they straue who should be Cocke of this worldes
dunghill, the benefit they got, was, that the afterliuers may say,
<quote xml:lang="lat"><l>Haec memini et victum frustra contendere Thirsim. </l>
<l>Ex illo Coridon, Coridon est tempore nobis. </l></quote>
</p>

<p>Or is it the lamenting <name rend="italic">Elegiack</name>, which in a kinde
heart would mooue rather pittie then blame, who
bewaileth with the great Philosopher <name rend="italic">Heraclitus, </name>
the weakenesse of mankinde, and the wretchednesse of the world:  who surely is to bee praised
either for compassionate accompanying iust causes of lamentations, or for nightlie painting out
how weake be the passions of wofulnesse ?  Is it
the bitter but wholesome <name rend="italic">Iambick, </name> who rubbes the
galled minde, in making shame the Trumpet of
villanie, with bolde and open crying out against
naughtinesse ?  Or the <name rend="italic">Satirick, </name>
who <foreign xml:lang="lat">Omne vafer vitium ridenti tandit amico, </foreign> who sportingly, neuer
leaueth, till he make a man laugh at follie; and at
length ashamed, to laugh at himself; which he cannot auoyde, without auoyding the follie ?  who
while <foreign xml:lang="lat">Circum præcordia ludit, </foreign> giueth vs to feele how
many headaches a passionate life bringeth vs to?
How when all is done, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Est Vlubris animus si nos non deficit aquus. </foreign>
</p>

<p>No perchance it is the <name rend="italic">Comick, </name> whom
naughtie Play-makers and stage-keepers, haue iustly made odious. To the arguments of abuse, I will
after answer, onely thus much now is to be said, that
the <name rend="italic">Comedy</name> is an imitation of the common errors of our
life, which he representeth in the most ridiculous &amp;
scornfull sort that may be:  so as it is impossible that
any beholder can be content to be such a one. Now
as in <name rend="italic">Geometrie, </name> the oblique must be knowne as well
as the right, and in <name rend="italic">Arithmetick, </name> the odde as well as
the euen, so in the actions of our life, who seeth not
the filthinesse of euill, wanteth a great foile to perceiue the bewtie of vertue. This doth the Comædie
handle so in our priuate and domesticall matters, as
with hearing it, wee get as it were an experience
what is to be looked for of a niggardly <name rend="italic">Demea, </name> of a
craftie <name rend="italic">Dauus, </name> of a flattering <name rend="italic">Gnato, </name> of a
vain-glorious <name rend="italic">Thrasa: </name> and not onely to know what effects are
to be expected, but to know who be such, by the
signifying badge giuen them by the <name rend="italic">Comædient</name>.
And litle reason hath any man to say, that men learne
the euill by seeing it so set out, since as I said before,
there is no man liuing, but by the force truth hath in
nature, no sooner seeth these men play their parts,
but wisheth them in <name rend="italic">Pistrinum, </name>although perchance
the sack of his owne faults lie so behinde his backe,
that he seeth not himselfe to dance the same measure:
wherto yet nothing can more open his eies, then to
see his owne actions contemptibly set forth. So that
the right vse of <name rend="italic">Comædie </name>, will I thinke, by no bodie
be blamed; and much lesse of the high and excellent
<name rend="italic">Tragedie, </name> that openeth the greatest woundes, and
sheweth forth the <name rend="italic">Vlcers</name> that are couered with <name rend="italic">Tissue, </name> that
maketh Kings feare to be Tyrants, and Tyrants manifest their tyrannicall humours, that with
sturring the affects of <name rend="italic">Admiration</name> and <name rend="italic">Comiseration</name>,
teacheth the vncertaintie of this world, and vppon
how weak foundations guilden roofes are builded: that maketh
vs know, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Qui scæptra sæuus duro imperio regit, Timet timentes, metus in authorem redit. </foreign>
</p>

<p>But how much it can moue, <name rend="italic">Plutarch</name> yeeldeth a notable
testimonie of the abhominable Tyrant <name rend="italic">Alexander</name>
<name rend="italic">Pheræus, </name> from whose eyes a <name rend="italic">Tragedie</name> well made and
represented, drew abundance of teares, who without all pittie had murthered infinite numbers, and
some of his owne bloud:  so as he that was not ashamed to make matters for <name rend="italic">Tragedies </name>, yet could not
resist the sweete violence of a <name rend="italic">Tragedie</name>. And if it
wrought no further good in him, it was, that he in
despight of himself, withdrew himselfe from hearkening to that which might mollifie his hardened
heart. But it is not the <name rend="italic">Tragedie</name> they do mislike,
for it were too absurd to cast our so excellent a representation of whatsoeuer is most woorthie to be
learned.
</p>

<p>Is it the <name rend="italic">Lyricke</name> that moste displeaseth,
who with his tuned <name rend="italic">Lyre</name> and well accorded voice,
giueth praise, the reward of vertue, to vertuous
acts ?  who giueth morall preceptes and naturall
Problemes, who sometime raiseth vp his voyce to
the height of the heauens, in singing the laudes
of the immortall God ?  Certainly I must confesse
mine owne barbarousnesse, I neuer heard the old
Song of <name rend="italic">Percy</name> and <name rend="italic">Duglas</name>, that I founde not my
heart mooued more then with a Trumpet ; and
yet is it sung but by some blinde Crowder, with
no rougher voyce, then rude stile:  which being
so euill apparelled in the dust and Cobwebbes of
that vnciuill age, what would it worke, trimmed
in the gorgious eloquence of <name rend="italic">Pindare?</name>  In <name rend="italic">Hungarie</name> I haue
seene it the manner at all Feastes and
other such like meetings, to haue songs of their ancestors valure, which that right souldierlike nation,
think one of the chiefest kindlers of braue courage.
The incomperable <name rend="italic">Lacedemonians</name>, did not onelie
carrie that kinde of <name rend="italic">Musicke</name> euer with them to the
field, but euen at home, as such songs were made,
so were they all content to be singers of them: when
the lustie men were to tell what they did, the old
men what they had done, and the yoong what they
would doo. And where a man may say that <name rend="italic">Pindare</name> many times praiseth highly Victories of small
moment, rather matters of sport then vertue, as it
may be answered, it was the fault of the<name rend="italic">Poet </name>, and
not of the <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>; so indeed the chiefe fault was,
in the time and custome of the <name rend="italic">Greekes</name>, who set
those toyes at so high a price, that <name rend="italic">Phillip</name> of <name rend="italic">Macedon</name>
reckoned a horse-race wonne at <name rend="italic">Olympus</name>, among his three fearefull felicities. But as the
vnimitable <name rend="italic">Pindare</name> often did, so is that kind most
capable and most fit, to awake the thoughts from
the sleepe of idlenesse, to embrace honourable enterprises.
</p>

<p>Their rests the <name rend="italic">Heroicall</name>, whose verie
name I thinke should daunt all backbiters. For by
what conceit can a tongue bee directed to speake
euil of that which draweth with him no lesse champions then <name rend="italic">Achilles</name>,
<name rend="italic">Cirus</name>, <name rend="italic">Aeneas</name>, <name rend="italic">Turnus</name>, <name rend="italic">Tideus</name>,
<name rend="italic">Rinaldo</name>, who doeth not onely teache and
mooue to a truth, but teacheth and mooueth to
the most high and excellent truth:  who maketh
magnanimitie and iustice, shine through all mistie
fearefulnesse foggie desires. Who if the
saying of <name rend="italic">Plato</name> and <name rend="italic">Tully</name> bee true, that who could
see vertue, woulde bee woonderfullie rauished
with the loue of her bewtie. This man setteth
her out to make her more louely in her holliday
apparrell, to the eye of anie that will daine, not to
disdaine vntill they vnderstand.  But if any thing
be alreadie said in the defence of sweete <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>, all
concurreth to the mainteining the <name rend="italic">Heroicall</name>, which
is not onelie a kinde, but the best and most accomplished kindes of <name rend="italic">Poetrie. </name>  For as the Image
of each Action stirreth and instructeth the minde,
so the loftie Image of such woorthies, moste enflameth the minde with desire to bee woorthie:
and enformes with counsaile how to bee woorthie. Onely let <name rend="italic">Aeneas</name>  bee worne in
the Tablet of your memorie, how hee gouerneth himselfe in the ruine of his Countrey, in the
preseruing his olde Father, and carrying away his religious Ceremonies,
in obeying Gods Commaunment, to leaue <name rend="italic">Dido </name>, though not onelie all
passionate kindnesse, but euen the humane consideration of vertuous gratefulnesse, would haue
craued other of him:  how in stormes, how in sports,
how in warre, how in peace, how a fugitiue,
how victorious, how besieged, how besieging,
how to straungers, how to Allies, how to enemies, how to his owne. Lastly, how in
his inwarde selfe, and howe in his outward gouernment, and I thinke in a minde moste preiudiced
with a preiudicating humour, Hee will bee
founde in excellencie fruitefull.
</p>

<p>Yea as <name rend="italic">Horace</name>
saith, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Melius Chrisippo et Crantore</foreign>:  but truly I imagin it falleth out with these Poet-whippers, as with
some good women who often are sicke, but in faith
they cannot tel where. So the name of <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name> is odious
to them, but neither his cause nor effects, neither the summe that containes
him, nor the particularities descending from him, giue any fast handle to
their carping dispraise. Since then <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name> is of al humane learnings the most ancient,
and of most fatherly antiquitie, as from whence other learnings haue
taken their beginnings ; Since it is so vniuersall, that
no learned nation doth despise it, nor barbarous nation is without it;
Since both <name rend="italic">Romane &amp; Greeke</name> gaue
such diuine names vnto it, the one of prophesying,
the other of making ; and that indeed that name of
making is fit for him, considering, that where all other Arts retain themselues within their subiect, and
receiue as it were their being from it. The <name rend="italic">Poet</name> onely, onely bringeth his own stuffe, and doth not learn
a Conceit out of a matter, but maketh matter for a
Conceit. Since neither his description, nor end, containing any euill, the thing described cannot be euil;
since his effects be so good as to teach goodnes, and
delight the learners of it; since therein (namely in
morall doctrine the chiefe of all knowledges) hee
doth not onely farre passe the <name rend="italic">Historian</name>, but for instructing
is well nigh comparable to the <name rend="italic">Philosopher, </name>
for mouing, leaueth him behind him. Since the holy scripture (wherein there is no vncleannesse) hath
whole parts in it Poeticall, and that euen our Sauior
Christ vouchsafed to vse the flowers of it:  since all
his kindes are not onely in their vnited formes, but
in their seuered dissections fully commendable, I
thinke, ( and thinke I thinke rightly ) the Lawrell
Crowne appointed for tryumphant Captaines, doth
worthily of all other learnings, honour the <name rend="italic">Poets</name> triumph.
</p>

<p>But bicause we haue eares as well as toongs,
and that the lightest reasons that may be, will seeme
to waigh greatly, if nothing be put in the counterballance, let vs heare, and as well as we can, ponder
what obiections be made against this Art, which
may be woorthie either of yeelding, or answering.
First truly I note, not onely in these <foreign xml:lang="grc">misomou=soi</foreign>, Poet-haters,
but in all that kind of people who seek a praise,
by dispraising others, that they do prodigally spend
a great many wandring words in quips and scoffes,
carping and taunting at each thing, which by sturring the spleene, may staie the brain from a through
beholding the worthinesse of the subiect. Those
kind of obiections, as they are full or a verie idle easinesse, since there is nothing of so sacred a maiestie,
but that an itching toong may rub it selfe vpon it, so
deserue they no other answer, but in steed of laughing at the ieast, to laugh at the ieaster. We know a
playing wit can praise the discretion of an Asse, the
comfortablenes of being in debt, and the iolly commodities of being sicke of the plague. So
of the contrary side, if we will turne <name rend="italic">Ouids</name>
verse, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Vt lateat virtus, prox imitate mali, </foreign> that good lye hid, in nearnesse
of the euill. <name rend="italic">Agrippa</name> will be as mery in shewing the
vanitie of Science, as <name rend="italic">Erasmus</name> was in the commending of folly:  neither shal any man or matter, escape
some touch of these smiling Raylers. But for <name rend="italic">Erasmus</name>
and <name rend="italic">Agrippa</name>, they had an other foundation then
the superficiall part would promise. Marry these other pleasaunt fault-finders, who will correct the
<name rend="italic">Verbe</name>, before they vnderstand the <name rend="italic">Nowne, </name>
and confute others knowledge, before they confirme their
owne, I would haue them onely remember, that
scoffing commeth not of wisedome ; so as the best
title in true English they get with their meriments,
is to be called good fooles:  for so haue our graue
forefathers euer tearmed that humorous kinde of
iesters.
</p>

<p>But that which giueth greatest scope to their
scorning humor, is ryming and versing. It is alreadie said (and as I thinke truly said) it is not ryming
and versing that maketh <name rend="italic">Poesie: </name>  One may be a <name rend="italic">Poet</name>
without versing, and a versefier without <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>. But
yet presuppose it were inseperable, as indeed it seemeth <name rend="italic">Scalliger</name> iudgeth truly, it were an inseperable
commendation. For if <foreign xml:lang="lat">Oratio, </foreign> next to <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ratio, </foreign> Speech
next to Reason, be the greatest gift bestowed vpon
<name rend="italic">Mortalitie, </name> that cannot bee praiselesse, which doth
most polish that blessing of speech ;  which considereth each word not onely as a man may say by his
forcible qualitie, but by his best measured quantity:
carrying euen in themselues a <name rend="italic">Harmonie, </name> without
perchance number, measure, order, proportion, be
in our time growne odious. But laie aside the iust
praise it hath, by being the onely fit speech for <name rend="italic">Musicke</name>,
(<name rend="italic">Musicke</name> I say the most diuine striker of the senses). Thus much is vndoubtedly true,
that if reading be foolish without remembring, Memorie being the onely treasure of knowledge, those words
which are fittest for memory, are likewise most conuenient for knowledge.
</p>

<p>Now that Verse far exceedeth Prose, in the knitting vp of the memorie, the
reason is manifest, the words (besides their delight,
which hath a great affinitie to memorie) being so set
as one cannot be lost, but the whole woorke failes:
which accusing it selfe, calleth the remembrance
back to it selfe, and so most strongly confirmeth it.
Besides one word, so as it were begetting an other,
as be it in rime or measured verse, by the former a man
shall haue a neare gesse to the follower. Lastly euen
they that haue taught the Art of memory, haue shewed nothing so apt for it, as a certain roome diuided
into many places, well &amp; throughly knowne:  Now
that hath the verse in effect perfectly, euerie word
hauing his natural seat, which seat must needs make
the word remembred. But what needes more in a
thing so knowne to all men. Who is it that euer was
scholler, that doth not carry away som verses of <name rend="italic">Virgil</name>, <name rend="italic">Horace, </name>
or <name rend="italic">Cato, </name> which in his youth hee learned,
and euen to his old age serue him for hourely lessons;
as <foreign xml:lang="lat">Percontatorem fugito nam garrulus idem est, Dum tibi quisque placet credula turba sumas</foreign>. But
the fitnes it hath for memorie, is notably prooued by all deliuerie of
Arts, wherein for the most part, from <name rend="italic">Grammer, </name> to
<name rend="italic">Logick, Mathematickes, Phisick, </name> and the rest, the Rules
chiefly necessarie to be borne away, are compiled in
verses. So that verse being in it selfe sweet and orderly, and being best for memorie, the onely handle of
knowledge, it must be in iest that any man can speak
against it.
</p>

<p>Now then goe we to the most important
imputations laid to the poore <name rend="italic">Poets</name>, for ought I can
yet learne, they are these. First that there beeing
manie other more frutefull knowledges, a man
might better spend his time in them, then in this.
Secondly, that it is the mother of lyes. Thirdly, that
it is the nurse of abuse, infecting vs with many pestilent desires, with a <name rend="italic">Sirens</name> sweetnesse, drawing the
minde to the Serpents taile of sinfull fansies ; and
herein especially <name rend="italic">Comedies</name> giue the largest field to
eare, as <name rend="italic">Chawcer</name> saith, how both in other nations and
in ours, before <name rend="italic">Poets</name> did soften vs, we were full of
courage giuen to martial exercises, the pillers of manlike libertie, and not lulled a sleepe in shadie idlenes,
with <name rend="italic">Poets</name> pastimes. And lastly and chiefly, they cry
out with open mouth as if they had ouershot <name rend="italic">Robin-hood, </name>
that <name rend="italic">Plato</name> banished them out of his Commonwealth.
</p>

<p>Truly this is much, if there be much truth
in it. First to the first. That a man might better spend
his time, is a reason indeed:  but it doth as they say,
but <foreign xml:lang="lat">petere principium</foreign>. For if it be, as I affirme, that
no learning is so good, as that which teacheth and
moueth to vertue, and that none can both teach and
moue thereto so much as <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>, then is the conclusion manifest ; that incke and paper cannot be to a
more profitable purpose imployed. And certainly
though a man should graunt their first assumption,
it should follow (mee thinks) very vnwillingly, that
good is not good, because better is better. But I still
and vtterly deny, that there is sprung out of earth a
more fruitfull knowledge. To the second therfore,
that they should be the principall lyers, I answere
<name rend="italic">Paradoxically</name>, but truly, I think truly:  that of all
writers vnder the Sunne, the <name rend="italic">Poet</name> is the least lyer:  and
though he wold, as a <name rend="italic">Poet</name> can scarcely be a lyer. The
<name rend="italic">Astronomer</name> with his cousin the <name rend="italic">Geometrician</name>, can
hardly escape, when they take vpon them to measure the height of the starres. How often thinke you
do the <name rend="italic">Phisitians</name> lie, when they auerre things good
for sicknesses, which afterwards send <name rend="italic">Charon</name> a great
number of soules drownd in a potion, before they
come to his Ferrie? And no lesse of the rest, which
take vpon them to affirme.
</p>

<p>Now for the <name rend="italic">Poet, </name>he nothing affirmeth, and therefore neuer lieth:  for as I
take it, to lie, is to affirme that to bee true, which is
false. So as the other <name rend="italic">Artistes</name>, and especially the <name rend="italic">Historian</name>,
affirming manie things, can in the clowdie
knowledge of mankinde, hardly escape from manie
lies. But the <name rend="italic">Poet</name> as I said before, neuer affirmeth, the
<name rend="italic">Poet</name> neuer maketh any Circles about your imagination, to
coniure you to beleeue for true, what he writeth: he citeth not authorities of other histories, but
euen for his entrie, calleth the sweete <name rend="italic">Muses</name> to inspire
vnto him a good inuention. In troth, not laboring to
tel you what is, or is not, but what should, or should
not be. And therefore though he recount things not
true, yet because he telleth them not for true, he lieth not:  without we will say, that <name rend="italic">Nathan</name> lied in his
speech before alleaged to <name rend="italic">Dauid</name>, which as a wicked
man durst scarce say, so think I none so simple, wold
say, that <name rend="italic">Esope</name> lied, in the tales of his beasts: for who
thinketh that <name rend="italic">Esope</name> wrote it for actually true, were
wel worthie to haue his name Cronicled among the
beasts he writeth of. What childe is there, that comming to a play,
and seeing <name rend="italic">Thebes</name> written in great letters vpon an old doore, doth beleeue that it
is <name rend="italic">Thebes?</name>  If then a man can arriue to the childes age, to
know that the <name rend="italic">Poets</name> persons and dooings, are but
pictures, what should be, and not stories what haue
bin, they will neuer giue the lie to things not Affirmatiuely, but Allegorically and figuratiuely written;
and therefore as is historie looking for truth,
they may go away full fraught with falshood.
</p>

<p>So in <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>, looking but for fiction, they shall vse the
narration but as an imaginatiue groundplat of a
profitable inuention. But hereto is replied, that the
<name rend="italic">Poets</name> giue names to men they write of, which argueth a conceit of an actual truth, and so
not being true, prooueth a falshood . And dooth the
<name rend="italic">Lawier</name> lye, then when vnder the names of <name rend="italic">Iohn</name> of
the <name rend="italic">Stile</name>, and <name rend="italic">Iohn</name> of the <name rend="italic">Nokes</name>, hee putteth his
Case?  But that is easily answered, their naming
of men, is but to make their picture the more liuely, and not to build anie Historie. Painting men,
they cannot leaue men namelesse:  wee see, wee
cannot plaie at Chestes, but that wee must giue
names to our Chessemen ;  and yet mee thinkes he
were a verie partiall Champion of truth, that would
say wee lyed, for giuing a peece of wood the reuerende
title of a Bishop. The <name rend="italic">Poet</name> nameth <name rend="italic">Cyrus</name> and
<name rend="italic">Aeneas, </name> no other way, then to shewe
what men of their fames, fortunes, and estates,
should doo. Their third is, how much it abuseth mens wit, training it to wanton sinfulnesse,
and lustfull loue. For indeed that is the principall
if not onely abuse, I can heare alleadged. They say
the <name rend="italic">Comedies </name> rather teach then reprehend amorous
conceits. They say the <name rend="italic">Lirick</name> is larded with passionat
<name rend="italic">Sonets</name>, the <name rend="italic">Elegiack</name> weeps the want of his mistresse,
and that euen to the <name rend="italic">Heroical Cupid</name> hath ambitiously
climed. Alas Loue, I would thou couldest as wel defend thy selfe, as thou canst offend others:  I would
those on whom thou doest attend, could either put
thee away, or yeeld good reason why they keepe
thee. But grant loue of bewtie to be a beastly fault,
although it be verie hard, since onely man and no
beast hath that gift to discerne bewtie, graunt that
louely name of loue to deserue all hatefull reproches, although euen some of my maisters
the <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name> spent a good deale of their Lampoyle in setting foorth the excellencie of it, graunt I say, what
they will haue graunted, that not onelie loue, but
lust, but vanitie, but if they list scurrilitie, possesse
manie leaues of the <name rend="italic">Poets</name> bookes, yet thinke I,
when this is graunted, they will finde their sentence may with good manners put the last words
foremost ; and not say, that <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name> abuseth mans
wit, but that mans wit abuseth <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>.
</p>

<p>For I will not denie, but that mans wit may make <name rend="italic">Poesie, </name>
which should be <foreign xml:lang="grc">ei)kastikh/</foreign> which some learned haue
defined figuring foorth good things to be <foreign xml:lang="grc">qanastikh/</foreign>
which doth contrariwise infect  the fancie with vnwoorthie obiects, as the Painter should giue to
the eye either some excellent perspectiue, or some
fine Picture fit for building or fortification, or
containing in it some notable example, as <name rend="italic">Abraham</name> sacrificing his
sonne <name rend="italic">Isaack, Iudith</name> killing <name rend="italic">Holofernes, Dauid</name> fighting
with <name rend="italic">Golias, </name>may leaue those,
and please an ill pleased eye with wanton shewes
of better hidden matters. But what, shal the abuse of a
thing, make the right vse odious?  Nay truly though
I yeeld, that <name rend="italic">Poesie</name> may not onely be abused, but that
being abused by the reason of his sweete charming
force, it can do more hurt then anie other armie of
words: yet shall it be so farre from concluding, that
the abuse should giue reproach to the abused, that
contrariwise, it is a good reason, that whatsoeuer being abused, doth most harme, being rightly vsed (and
vpon the right vse, ech thing receiues his title) doth
most good.
</p>

<p>Do we not see skill of Phisicke the best
ramper to our often assaulted bodies, being abused,
teach poyson the most violent destroyer ?  Doth not
knowledge of Law, whose end is, to euen &amp; right
all things, being abused, grow the crooked fosterer
of horrible iniuries?  Doth not (to go to the highest)
Gods word abused, breede heresie, and his name abused, become blasphemie?  Truly a Needle cannot
do much hurt, and as truly (with leaue of Ladies be
it spoken) it cannot do much good. With a swoord
thou maist kill thy Father, and with a swoord thou
maist defende thy Prince and Countrey:  so that, as in
their calling <name rend="italic">Poets, </name>fathers of lies, they said nothing,
so in this their argument of abuse, they prooue the
commendation. They alledge herewith, that before
<name rend="italic">Poets</name> began to be in price, our Nation had set their
hearts delight vppon action, and not imagination,
rather doing things worthie to be written, then writing things fit to be done. What that before time
was, I think scarcely <name rend="italic">Spinx</name> can tell:  since no memerie is
so ancient, that hath not the precedens of <name rend="italic">Poetrie. </name>  And certain it is, that in our plainest homelines,
yet neuer was the <name rend="italic">Albion</name> Nation without <name rend="italic">Poetrie. </name>
Marry this Argument, thou it be leuiled against
<name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>, yet is it indeed a chain-shot against all learning or bookishnes, as they commonly terme it. Of
such mind were certaine <name rend="italic">Gothes, </name> of whom it is written, that hauing in the spoile of a famous
Cittie, taken a faire Librarie, one hangman belike fit to execute the frutes of their wits, who had murthered a
great number of bodies, would haue set fire in it.
No said an other verie grauely, take heed what you
do, for while they are busie about those toyes, wee
shall with more leisure conquere their Countries.
This indeed is the ordinarie doctrine of ignorance,
and many words sometimes I haue heard spent in
it: but bicause this reason is generally against al learning, as wel
as <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>, or rather all learning but <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>, because it
were too large a digression to handle
it, or at least too superfluous, since it is manifest that
all gouernment of action is to be gotten by knowledge, and knowledge best, by gathering manie
knowledges, which is reading; I onely with <name rend="italic">Horace</name>,
to him that is of that opinion, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Iubio stultum esse libenter</foreign>: for as
for <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name> it selfe, it is the freest from this
obiection, for <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name> is the Companion of Camps.
I dare vndertake, <name rend="italic">Orlando Furioso</name>, or honest king <name rend="italic">Arthure</name>, will
neuer displease a souldier:  but the quidditie of <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ens et Prima materia, </foreign> will hardly agree with
a Corcelet.
</p>

<p>And therefore as I said in the beginning,
euen <name rend="italic">Turkes</name> and <name rend="italic">Tartars</name>, are delighted with <name rend="italic">Poets. </name>
<name rend="italic">Homer</name> a <name rend="italic">Greeke</name>, flourished, before <name rend="italic">Greece</name> flourished:
and if to a slight coniecture, a coniecture may bee
apposed, truly it may seem, that as by him their learned men tooke almost their first light of knowledge,
so their actiue men, receiued their first motions of
courage. Onely <name rend="italic">Alexanders</name> example may serue,
who by <name rend="italic">Plutarche</name> is accounted of such vertue, that
fortune was not his guide, but his footestoole,
whose Acts speake for him, though <name rend="italic">Plutarche</name> did
not:  indeede the <name rend="italic">Phoenix</name> of warlike Princes. This
<name rend="italic">Alexander</name>, left his Schoolemaister liuing <name rend="italic">Aristotle</name>
behinde him, but tooke dead <name rend="italic">Homer</name> with
him. Hee put the Philosopher <name rend="italic">Callisthenes</name> to death,
for his seeming Philosophicall, indeed mutinous
stubbornnesse, but the chiefe thing hee was euer
heard to wish for, was, that <name rend="italic">Homer</name> had bene aliue.
Hee well founde hee receiued more brauerie of
minde by paterne of <name rend="italic">Achilles</name>, then by hearing
the definition of fortitude. And therefore if <name rend="italic">Cato</name> misliked <name rend="italic">Fuluius</name>
for carrying <name rend="italic">Ennius</name> with him
to the field, It may be answered, that if <name rend="italic">Cato</name> misliked it,
the Noble <name rend="italic">Fuluius</name> liked it, or else he had
not done it ; for it was not the excellent <name rend="italic">Cato Vticencis</name>, whose authoritie I would much more haue
reuerenced: But it was the former, in truth a bitter punisher of faultes, but else a man that had neuer
sacrificed to the <name rend="italic">Graces</name>. Hee misliked and cried out against all Greeke learning, and yet being
foure score yeares olde beganne to learne it, belike fearing that <name rend="italic">Pluto</name> vnderstood not Latine. Indeed
the <name rend="italic">Romane</name> lawes allowed no person to bee
carried to the warres, but hee that was in the souldiers Role. And therefore though <name rend="italic">Cato</name> misliked
his vnmustred person, he misliked not his worke.
And if hee had, <name rend="italic">Scipio Nasica</name> (iudged by common
consent the best <name rend="italic">Romane)</name> loued him:  both the other
<name rend="italic">Scipio</name> brothers, who had by their vertues no lesse
surnames then of <name rend="italic">Asia</name> and <name rend="italic">Affricke</name>, so loued him,
that they caused his bodie to be buried in their Sepulture. So as <name rend="italic">Catoes</name> authoritie beeing but against
his person, and that answered with so farre greater then himselfe, is herein of no validitie.
</p>

<p>But now indeede my burthen is great, that <name rend="italic">Plato</name> his
name is laide vppon mee, whom I must confesse
of all <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name>, I haue euer esteemed most worthie of reuerence ; and with good reason, since of
all <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name> hee is the most <name rend="italic">Poeticall: </name>  yet if hee
will defile the fountaine out of which his flowing
streames haue proceeded, let vs boldly examine
with what reasons hee did it . First truly a man
might maliciously obiect, that <name rend="italic">Plato</name> being a <name rend="italic">Philosopher, </name>
was a naturall enemy of <name rend="italic">Poets. </name>  For indeede
after the <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name> had picked out of the sweete
misteries of <name rend="italic">Poetrie, </name> the right discerning true points
of knowledge:  they foorthwith putting it in methode, and making a Schoole Art of that which the
<name rend="italic">Poets</name> did onely teach by a diuine delightfulnes, beginning to spurne at their guides, like vngratefull
Prentices, were not content to set vp shop for themselues, but sought by all meanes to discredit their
maisters, which by the force of delight being barred them, the lesse they could ouerthrow them, the
more they hated them. For indeed they found for
<name rend="italic">Homer</name>, seuen Cities straue who should haue him for
their Cittizen, where many Cities banished <name rend="italic">Philosophers, </name> as not fit members to liue among them. For
onely repeating certaine of <name rend="italic">Euripides</name> verses,
many <name rend="italic">Atheniens</name> had their liues saued of the <name rend="italic">Siracusans</name>;
where the <name rend="italic">Atheniens</name> themselues thought
many <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name> vnworthie to liue.
</p>

<p>Certaine <name rend="italic">Poets, </name> as <name rend="italic">Simonides, </name> and <name rend="italic">Pindarus</name>, had so preuailed with
<name rend="italic">Hiero</name> the first, that of a Tyrant they made him a iust
King:  where <name rend="italic">Plato</name> could do so little with <name rend="italic">Dionisius</name>,
that he himselfe of a <name rend="italic">Philosopher</name>, was made a slaue.
But who should do thus, I confesse should requite
the obiections made against <name rend="italic">Poets</name>, with like
cauillations against <name rend="italic">Philosophers: </name> as likewise one should
do, that should bid one read <name rend="italic">Phaedrus</name> or <name rend="italic">Simposium</name>
in <name rend="italic">Plato</name>, or the discourse of loue in <name rend="italic">Plutarch</name>, and see
whether any <name rend="italic">Poet</name> do authorise abhominable filthinesse as they doo. Againe, a man might aske, out of
what Common-wealth <name rend="italic">Plato</name> doth banish them, in
sooth, thence where he himselfe alloweth communitie of women. So as belike this banishment grew
not for effeminate wantonnesse, since little should
Poetical <name rend="italic">Sonnets</name> be hurtful, when a man might haue
what woman he listed. But I honor Philosophicall
instructions, and blesse the wits which bred them:
so as they be not abused, which is likewise stretched
to <name rend="italic">Poetrie. </name>  <name rend="italic">S.  Paul</name> himselfe sets a watch-word vppon
<name rend="italic">Philosophie</name>, indeed vppon the abuse. So doth <name rend="italic">Plato</name>
vppon the abuse, not vpon <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>. <name rend="italic">Plato</name> found fault
that the <name rend="italic">Poettes</name> of his time, filled the worlde with
wrong opinions of the Gods, making light tales of
that vnspotted essence ; and therfore wold not haue
the youth depraued with such opinions:  heerein
may much be said ; let this suffice.
</p>

<p>The <name rend="italic">Poets</name> did not
induce such opinions, but did imitate those opinions alreadie induced. For all the <name rend="italic">Greeke</name> stories can
well testifie, that the verie religion of that time, stood
vpon many, and many fashioned Gods: Not taught
so by <name rend="italic">Poets</name>, but followed according to their nature
of imitation. Who list may read in <name rend="italic">Plutarch, </name> the
discourses of <name rend="italic">Isis</name> and <name rend="italic">Osiis</name>, of the cause why Oracles
ceased, of the diuine prouidence, &amp; see whether the
<name rend="italic">Theology</name> of that nation, stood not vpon such dreams,
which the <name rend="italic">Poets</name> indeede superstitiously obserued.
And truly since they had not the light of Christ, did
much better in it, then the <name rend="italic">Philosophers, </name>who shaking
off superstition, brought in <name rend="italic">Atheisme</name>. <name rend="italic">Plato</name> therfore,
whose authoritie, I had much rather iustly consture,
then vniustly resist:  ment not in generall of <name rend="italic">Poets</name>, in
those words of which <name rend="italic">Iulius Scaliger</name> saith; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Qua authoritate
barbari quidam atque hispidi abuti velint ad poetas et U+00E8 rep. Exigendos. </foreign> But only ment to driue out those
wrong opinions of the Deitie:  wherof now without further law, <name rend="italic">Christianitie</name> hath taken away all the
hurtful beliefe, perchance as he thought nourished
by then esteemed <name rend="italic">Poets</name>. And a man need go no further then to <name rend="italic">Plato</name> himselfe to knowe his meaning:
who in his Dialogue called <name rend="italic">Ion</name>, giueth high, and
rightly, diuine commendation vnto <name rend="italic">Poetrie. </name>  So as
<name rend="italic">Plato</name> banishing the abuse, not the thing, not banishing it, but giuing due honour to it, shall be our
Patron, and not our aduersarie. For indeed, I had
much rather, since truly I may do it, shew their mistaking of <name rend="italic">Plato</name>, vnder whose Lyons skinne, they
would make an Aslike braying against <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>, then
go about to ouerthrow his authoritie ; whome the
wiser a man is, the more iust cause he shall finde to
haue in admiration:  especially since he attributeth
vnto <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>, more then my selfe do ; namely, to be a
verie inspiring of a diuine force, farre aboue mans
wit, as in the forenamed Dialogue is apparant.
</p>

<p>Of the other side, who would shew the honours haue
bene by the best sort of iudgements graunted them,
a whole sea of examples woulde present themselues; <name rend="italic">Alexanders</name>,
<name rend="italic">Cæsars</name>, <name rend="italic">Scipioes</name>, all fauourers
of <name rend="italic">Poets: </name> <name rend="italic">Lælius</name>, called the Romane <name rend="italic">Socrates</name> himselfe
a <name rend="italic">Poet</name> ; so as part of <name rend="italic">Heautontimoroumenon</name> in
<name rend="italic">Terrace</name>, was supposed to bee made by him. And
euen the Greeke <name rend="italic">Socrates</name>, whome <name rend="italic">Appollo</name> confirmed to bee the onely wise man, is said to haue
spent part of his olde time in putting <name rend="italic">Esopes</name> Fables into verses. And therefore full euill should
it become his scholler <name rend="italic">Plato, </name> to put such words in
his maisters mouth against <name rend="italic">Poets</name>. But what needs
more?  <name rend="italic">Aristotle</name> writes the Arte of <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>, and
why, if it should not bee written ?  <name rend="italic">Plutarche</name> teacheth the vse to bee gathered of them, and how,
if they should not bee reade ?  And who reades
<name rend="italic">Plutarches</name> either Historie or <name rend="italic">Philosophie, </name> shall finde
hee trimmeth both their garments with gardes of
<name rend="italic">Poesie</name>. But I list not to defend <name rend="italic">Poesie</name> with the helpe
of his vnderling <name rend="italic">Historiographie</name>. Let it suffice to
haue shewed, it is a fit soyle for praise to dwell vppon:  and what dispraise may set vppon it,
is either easily ouercome, or transformed into iust commendation. So that since the excellencies of it,
may bee so easily and so iustly confirmed, and the
lowe creeping obiections so soone trodden downe,
it not beeing an Art of lyes, but of true doctrine;
not of effeminatenesse, but of notable stirring of
courage; not of abusing mans wit, but of strengthening mans wit;not banished, but honored by <name rend="italic">Plato</name>;
Let vs rather plant more Lawrels for to ingarland
the <name rend="italic">Poets</name> heads (which honor of being Lawreate,
as besides them onely triumphant Captaines were,
is a sufficient authoritie to shewe the price they
ought to bee held in ) then suffer the ill sauoured
breath of such wrong speakers once to blow vppon the cleare springs of <name rend="italic">Poesie. </name>
</p>

<p>But since I haue runne so long a Carrier in this matter, methinkes
before I giue my penne a full stoppe, it shall be
but a litle more lost time, to enquire why England
the Mother of excellent mindes should be growne
so hard a stepmother to <name rend="italic">Poets</name>, who certainely in
wit ought to passe all others, since all onely proceedes from their wit, beeing indeed makers of
themselues, not takers of others. How can I but
exclaime. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Musa mihi causas memoria quo numine laeso</foreign>,
Sweete <name rend="italic">Poesie</name> that hath aunciently had Kings,
Emperours, Senatours, great Captaines, such as
besides a thousandes others, <name rend="italic">Dauid, Adrian, Sophocles, Germanicus, </name>
not onelie to fauour <name rend="italic">Poets, </name> but
to bee <name rend="italic">Poets: </name> and of our nearer times, can present
for her Patrons, a <name rend="italic">Robert</name> King of <name rend="italic">Scicill</name>, the great
King <name rend="italic">Fraunces</name> of <name rend="italic">Fraunce, </name> King <name rend="italic">Iames</name> of <name rend="italic">Scotland</name>;
such Cardinalls as <name rend="italic">Bembus</name>, and <name rend="italic">Bibiena</name> ; suche famous
Preachers and Teachers, as <name rend="italic">Beza</name> and <name rend="italic">Melanchthon</name>;
so learned <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name>, as <name rend="italic">Fracastorius</name>,
and <name rend="italic">Scaliger</name> ; so great Orators, as <name rend="italic">Pontanus</name>,
and <name rend="italic">Muretus</name> ; so pearcing wits, as <name rend="italic">George Buchanan</name>;
so graue Cousailours, as besides manie,
but before all, the <name rend="italic">Hospitall</name> of <name rend="italic">Fraunce</name> ; then
whome I thinke that Realme neuer brought forth
a more accomplished iudgement, more firmly builded vpon vertue: I say these with numbers of others,
not onely to read others <name rend="italic">Poesies, </name> but to <name rend="italic">poetise</name> for others
reading ; that <name rend="italic">Poesie</name> thus embraced in all other
places, should onely finde in our time a hard welcome in England. I thinke the verie earth laments it,
and therefore deckes our soyle with fewer Lawrels
then it was accustomed. For heretofore, <name rend="italic">Poets</name> haue
in England also flourished:  and which is to be noted, euen in those times when the Trumpet of <name rend="italic">Mars</name>
did sound lowdest.
</p>

<p>And now that an ouer faint quietnesse should seeme to strowe the house for <name rend="italic">Poets</name>.
They are almost in as good reputation, as the <name rend="italic">Mountebanckes</name>
at <name rend="italic">Venice</name>. Truly euen that, as of the one side
it giueth great praise to <name rend="italic">Poesie, </name> which like <name rend="italic">Venus</name>(but
to better purpose) had rather be troubled in the net
with <name rend="italic">Mars, </name>then enioy the homely quiet of <name rend="italic">Vulcan</name>.
So serueth it for a peece of a reason, why they are lesse
gratefull to idle England, which now can scarce endure the paine of a penne. Vpon this necessarily
followeth, that base men with seruill wits vndertake it,
who thinke it inough if they can be rewarded of the
Printer: and so as <name rend="italic">Epaminandas</name> is said with the honor
of his vertue to haue made an Office, by his exercising it, which before was contemtible, to become
highly respected:  so these men no more but setting
their names to it, by their own disgracefulnesse, disgrace the most gracefull <name rend="italic">Poesie. </name>  For now as if all the
<name rend="italic">Muses</name> were got with childe, to bring forth bastard
Poets:  without any commission, they do passe ouer
the Bankes of <name rend="italic">Helicon</name>, till they make the Readers
more wearie then Post-horses:  while in the meane
time, they <foreign xml:lang="lat">Queis meliore luto finxit praecordia Titan, </foreign>
are better content to suppresse the out-flowings of
their wit, then by publishing them, to be accounted
Knights of the same order.
</p>

<p>But I that before euer I
durst aspire vnto the dignitie, am admitted into the
companie of the <name rend="italic">Paper-blurrers</name>, do finde the verie
true cause of our wanting estimation, is want of desert, taking vppon
vs to be <name rend="italic">Poets, </name>in despite of <name rend="italic">Pallas</name>.
Now wherein we want desert, were a thankwoorthie labour to expresse. But if I knew I should haue
mended my selfe, but as I neuer desired the title, so
haue I neglected the meanes to come by it, onely
ouer-mastered by some thoughts, I yeelded an inckie tribute vnto them. Marrie they that delight in
<name rend="italic">Poesie</name> it selfe, should seek to know what they do, and
how they do:  and especially looke themselues in an
vnflattering glasse of reason, if they be enclinable
vnto it. For <name rend="italic">Poesie</name> must not be drawne by the eares,
it must be gently led, or rather it must lead, which
was partly the cause that made the auncient learned
affirme, it was a diuine gift &amp; no humane skil; since
all other knowledges lie readie for anie that haue
strength of wit:  A <name rend="italic">Poet</name> no industrie can make, if his
owne <name rend="italic">Genius</name> be not carried into it. And therefore is
an old Prouerbe, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Orator fit, Poeta nascitur</foreign>.
</p>

<p>Yet confesse I alwaies, that as the fertilest ground must
be manured, so must the highest flying wit haue a
<name rend="italic">Dedalus</name> to guide him. That <name rend="italic">Dedalus</name> they say both in
this and in other, hath three wings to beare it selfe
vp into the aire of due commendation:  that is Art,
Imitation, and Exercise. But these neither Artificall Rules, nor imitatiue paternes, we much comber
our selues withall. Exercise indeed we do, but that
verie fore-backwardly ; for where we should exercise to know, we exercise as hauing knowne:  and
so is our braine deliuered of much matter, which
neuer was begotten by knowledge. For there being two principall parts, Matter to be expressed by
words, and words to expresse the matter:  In neither, wee vse Art or imitation
rightly. Our matre is, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Quodlibet, </foreign> indeed though
wrongly performing, <name rend="italic">Ouids</name> Verse. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Quicquid conabor dicere, Versus erit: </foreign>
neuer marshalling it into anie assured ranck,
that almost the Readers cannot tell where to finde
themselues.
</p>

<p><name rend="italic">Chawcer</name> vndoubtedly did excellently in
his <name rend="italic">Troilus</name> and <name rend="italic">Creseid</name>:  of whome trulie I
knowe not whether to meruaile more, either that
hee in that mistie time could see so clearly, or that
wee in this cleare age, goe so stumblingly after
him. Yet had hee great wants, fit to be forgiuen in so reuerent an Antiquitie. I account the
Mirrour of Magistrates, meetly furnished of bewtiful partes. And in the Earle of <name rend="italic">Surreis Lirickes, </name>
manie thinges tasting of a Noble birth, and worthie of a Noble minde. The Sheepheards
Kallender, hath much <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name> in his Egloges, indeed
woorthie the reading, if I be not deceiued. That
same framing of his style to an olde rusticke language, I dare not allow:  since neither <name rend="italic">Theocritus</name>
in Greeke, <name rend="italic">Virgill</name> in Latine, nor <name rend="italic">Sanazara</name> in Italian,
did affect it. Besides these, I doo not remember to haue seene but fewe (to speake boldly) printed, that haue poeticall sinnewes in them.
For proofe whereof, let but moste of the Verses
bee put in profe, and then aske the meaning, and
it will bee founde, that one Verse did but beget
an other, without ordering at the first, what should
bee at the last, which becomes a confused masse of
words, with a tingling sound of ryme, barely accompanied with
reasons.
</p>

<p>Our Tragidies and Commedies, not without cause cryed out against, obseruing rules neither of
honest ciuilitie, not skilfull <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>. Excepting <name rend="italic">Gorboducke, </name> (againe I say of
those that I haue seen) which notwithstanding as it
is full of stately speeches, and wel sounding phrases,
clyming to the height of <name rend="italic">Seneca</name> his style, and as
full of notable morallitie, which it dooth most delightfully teach, and so obtaine the verie ende of
<name rend="italic">Poesie. </name>  Yet in truth, it is verie defectious in the
circumstaunces, which greeues mee, because it
might not remaine as an exact moddell of all Tragidies. For it is faultie both in place and time,
the two necessarie Companions of all corporall
actions. For where the Stage should alway represent but one place, and the vttermoste time
presupposed in it, should bee both by <name rend="italic">Aristotles</name>
precept, and common reason, but one day; there
is both manie dayes and places, inartificially imagined. But if it bee so in <name rend="italic">Gorboducke</name>, howe much
more in all the rest, where you shall haue <name rend="italic">Asia</name> of the one side, and <name rend="italic">Affricke</name> of the other, and
so manie other vnder Kingdomes, that the Player when he comes in, must euer begin with telling
where he is, or else the tale will not be conceiued.
Now you shall haue three Ladies walke to gather
flowers, and then we must beleeue the stage to be a
garden. By and by we heare newes of shipwrack in
the same place, then we are too blame if we accept
it not for a Rock. Vpon the back of that, comes out a
hidious monster with fire and smoke, and then the
miserable beholders are bound to take it for a Caue:
while in the meane time two Armies flie in, represented with foure swords &amp; bucklers, and then what
hard hart wil not receiue it for a pitched field.
</p>

<p>Now of time, they are much more liberall. For ordinarie
it is, that two yoong Princes fall in loue, after many
trauerses she is got with childe, deliuered of a faire
boy:  he is lost, groweth a man, falleth in loue, and
is readie to get an other childe, and all this in two
houres space:  which howe absurd it is in sence, euen sence may imagine:  and Arte hath taught,
and all auncient examples iustified, and at this
day the ordinarie players in <name rend="italic">Italie</name> will not erre in.
Yet will some bring in an example of <name rend="italic">Eunuche</name> in
<name rend="italic">Terence, </name>that conteineth matter of two dayes, yet far
short of twentie yeares. True it is, and so was it to
be played in two dayes, and so fitted to the time it
set foorth. And though <name rend="italic">Plautus</name> haue in one place
done amisse, let vs hit it with him, &amp; not misse with
him.  But they will say, how then shall we set foorth
a storie, which contains both many places, and many times ?  And do they not know that a Tragidie is
tied to the lawes of <name rend="italic">Poesie</name> and not of Historie:  not
bounde to follow the storie, but hauing libertie either to faine a quite new matter, or to
frame the Historie to the most Tragicall conueniencie.
Againe, many things may be told which cannot be shewed:
if they know the difference betwixt reporting and
representing.  As for example, I may speake though I
am here, of <name rend="italic">Peru, </name> and in speech digresse from that, to
the description of <name rend="italic">Calecut: </name> But in action, I cannot
represent it without <name rend="italic">Pacolets</name> Horse. And so was the
manner the Auncients tooke, by some <name rend="italic">Nuntius</name>, to
recount things done in former time or other place.
</p>

<p>Lastly, if they will represent an Historie, they must
not (as <name rend="italic">Horace</name> saith) beginne <foreign xml:lang="lat">ab ouo, </foreign> but they must
come to the principall poynte of that one action
which they will represent. By example this will
be best expressed. I haue a storie of yoong <name rend="italic">Polidorus</name>, deliuered for safeties sake with great riches,
by his Father <name rend="italic">Priamus</name>, to <name rend="italic">Polminester</name> King of
<name rend="italic">Thrace</name>, in the <name rend="italic">Troyan</name> warre time. He after some
yeares, hearing the ouerthrowe of <name rend="italic">Priamus</name>, for
to make the treasure his owne, murthereth the
Childe, the bodie of the Childe is taken vp, <name rend="italic">Hecuba</name>, shee the same day, findeth a sleight to bee
reuenged moste cruelly of the Tyrant . Where
nowe would one of our Tragedie writers begin,
but with the deliuerie of the Childe ?  Then should
hee saile ouer into <name rend="italic">Thrace, </name> and so spende I know
not howe many yeares, and trauaile numbers of
places. But where dooth <name rend="italic">Euripides ?</name> euen with
the finding of the bodie, the rest leauing to be told
by the spirite of <name rend="italic">Polidorus . </name>  This needes no further to bee enlarged, the dullest witte
may conceiue it .
</p>

<p>But besides these grosse absurdities,
howe all their Playes bee neither right Tragedies, nor right Comedies, mingling Kinges and
Clownes, not because the matter so carrieth it, but
thrust in the Clowne by head and shoulders to play
a part in maiesticall matters, with neither decencie not discretion:  so as neither the admiration
and Commiseration, not the right sportfulnesse is
by their mongrell Tragicomedie obtained.  I know
<name rend="italic">Apuleius, </name> did somewhat so, but that is a thing
recounted with space of time, not represented in
one moment:  and I knowe the Auncients haue
one or two examples of Tragicomedies, as <name rend="italic">Plautus</name>
hath <name rend="italic">Amphitrio. </name>  But if we marke them well,
wee shall finde that they neuer or verie daintily
matche horne Pipes and Funeralls. So falleth it
out, that hauing indeed no right Comedie in that
Comicall part of our Tragidie, wee haue nothing
but scurrillitie  vnwoorthie of anie chaste eares,
or some extreame shewe of doltishnesse, indeede
fit lift vp a loude laughter and nothing else:
where the whole tract of a Comedie should be
full of delight, as the Tragidie should bee still
maintained in a well raised admiration. But our
Comedients thinke there is no delight without
laughter, which is verie wrong, for though laughter may come with delight, yet commeth it not
of delight, as though delight should be the cause
of laughter. But well may one thing breed both
togither. Nay rather in themselues, they haue as
it were a kinde of contrarietie: For delight wee
scarcely doo, but in thinges that haue a conueniencie to our selues, or to the generall nature:
Laughter almost euer commeth of thinges moste
disproportioned to our selues, and nature.
</p>

<p>Delight hath a ioy in it either permanent or present.
Laughter hath onely a scornfull tickling. For example, wee are rauished with delight to see a faire
woman, and yet are farre from beeing mooued
to laughter. Wee laugh at deformed creatures,
wherein certainly wee cannot delight. We delight in good chaunces, wee laugh at mischaunces. We delight to heare the happinesse of our
friendes and Countrey, at which hee were worthie to be laughed at, that would laugh: we shall
contrarily laugh sometimes to finde a matter quite
mistaken, and goe downe the hill against the byas,
in the mouth of some such men as for the respect
of them, one shall be hartily sorie, he cannot chuse
but laugh, and so is rather pained, then delighted
with laughter. Yet denie I not, but that they
may goe well togither, for as in <name rend="italic">Alexanders</name> picture well set out, wee delight without laughter,
and in twentie madde Antiques, wee laugh without delight . So in <name rend="italic">Hercules</name>, painted with his
great beard and furious countenaunce, in a womans attyre, spinning, at <name rend="italic">Omphales</name> commaundement,
it breedes both delight and laughter:  for
the representing of so straunge a power in Loue,
procures delight, and the scornefulnesse of the
action, stirreth laughter . But I speake to this
purpose, that all the ende of the Comicall part,
bee not vppon suche scornefull matters as stirre
laughter onelie, but mixe with it, that delightfull teaching whiche is the ende of <name rend="italic">Poesie</name> .
</p>

<p>And the great faulte euen in that poynt of laughter,
and forbidden plainly by <name rend="italic">Aristotle, </name> is, that they stirre
laughter in sinfull things, which are rather execrable then ridiculous:  or in miserable, which are
rather to be pitied then scorned. For what is it to make
folkes gape at a wretched begger, and a beggerly
Clowne:  or against lawe of hospitalitie ; to ieast at
straungers, because they speake not English so well
as we do ?  What doo we learne, since it is certaine,
<foreign xml:lang="lat">Nil habet infelix paupert as durius in se, Quam quod ridiculos homines facit</foreign>. But
rather a busie louing Courtier, and a hartlesse threatning <name rend="italic">Thraso</name>; a selfe-wise-seeming
Schoolemaister, a wry transformed Traueller:  these if we saw walke in Stage names, which
we plaie naturally, therein were delightfull laughter, and teaching delightfulnesse; as in the other
the Tragidies of <name rend="italic">Buchanan</name> do iustly bring foorth a
a diuine admiration. But I haue lauished out too
many words of this Play-matter; I do it, because as
they are excelling parts of <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>, so is there none so
much vsed in England, and none can be more pittifully abused:  which like an vnmannerly daughter,
shewing a bad education, causeth her mother <name rend="italic">Poesies</name> honestie to be called in question.
</p>

<p>Other sort of
<name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>, almost haue we none, but that <name rend="italic">Lyricall</name> kind
of Songs and Sonets ; which Lord, if he gaue vs so
good mindes, how well it might be employed, and
with how heauenly fruites, both priuate and publike, in singing the praises of the immortall bewtie,
the immortall goodnes of that God, who giueth vs
hands to write, and wits to conceiue:  of which we
might wel want words, but neuer matter, of which
we could turne our eyes to nothing, but we should
euer haue new budding occasions. But truly many
of such writings as come vnder the banner of vnresistable loue, if I were a mistresse,
would neuer perswade mee they were in loue:  so coldly they applie
firie speeches, as men that had rather redde louers
writings, and so caught vp certaine swelling Phrases, which hang togither like a man that once tolde
me the winde was at Northwest and by South, because he would be sure to name winds inough, then
that in truth they feele those passions, which easily
as I thinke, may be bewraied by that same forciblenesse or <name rend="italic">Euergia</name>, (as the Greeks call it of the writer).
But let this be a sufficient, though short note, that
we misse the right vse of the materiall point of <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>.
</p>

<p>Now for the outside of it, which is words, or (as I
may tearme it) <name rend="italic">Diction</name>, it is euen well worse:  so is it
that hony-flowing Matrone <name rend="italic">Eloquence, </name> apparrelled,
or rather disguised, in a Courtisanlike painted affectation. One time with so farre fet words, that many
seeme monsters, but must seeme straungers  to anie
poore Englishman:  an other time with coursing of
a letter, as if they were bound to follow the method
of a Dictionary:  an other time with figures and flowers extreemly winter-starued. But I would this
fault were onely peculiar to Versefiers, and had not
as large possession among Prose-Printers:  and which
is to be meruailed among many Schollers, &amp; which
is to be pitied among some Preachers. Truly I could
wish, if at least I might be so bold to wish, in a thing
beyond the reach of my capacity, the diligent Imitators of <name rend="italic">Tully &amp; Demosthenes, </name>most worthie to be
imitated, did not so much keepe <name rend="italic">Nizolian</name> paper bookes,
of their figures and phrases, as by attentiue translation, as it were, deuoure them whole, and make
them wholly theirs. For now they cast Suger and
spice vppon euerie dish that is serued to the table:
like those <name rend="italic">Indians</name>, not content to weare eare-rings
at the fit and naturall place of the eares, but they
will thrust Iewels through their nose and lippes,
because they will be sure to be fine. <name rend="italic">Tully</name> when he
was to driue out <name rend="italic">Cataline</name>, as it were with a thunderbolt of eloquence, often vseth the figure
of repitition, as <foreign xml:lang="lat">Viuit et vincit, imo insenatum, Venit imo, in senatum venit, &amp;c. </foreign>
Indeede enflamed, with a well
grounded rage, hee would haue his words ( as it
were) double out of his mouth, and so do that artificially, which we see men in choller doo
naturally. And we hauing noted the grace of those words,
hale them in sometimes to a familiar Epistle, when
it were too much choller to be chollericke.
</p>

<p>How well store of <name rend="italic">Similiter Cadenses, </name> doth sound with
the grauitie of the Pulpit, I woulde but inuoke
<name rend="italic">Demosthenes</name> soule to tell: who with a rare daintinesse vseth them . Truly they haue made mee
thinke of the <name rend="italic">Sophister</name>, that with too much subtiltie would proue two Egges three, and though he
might bee counted a <name rend="italic">Sophister, </name> had none for his
labour. So these men bringing in such a kinde of
eloquence, well may they obtaine an opinion of a
seeming finenesse, but perswade few, which should
be the ende of their finenesse. Now for similitudes
in certain Printed discourses, I thinke all Herberists,
all stories of beasts, foules, and fishes, are rifled vp,
that they may come in multitudes to wait vpon any
of our conceits, which certainly is as absurd a surfet
to the eares as is possible. For the force of a similitude not being to proue any thing to a
contrary disputer, but onely to explaine to a willing hearer,
when that is done, the rest is a moste tedious pratling, rather ouerswaying the memorie from the
purpose whereto they were applied, then anie
whit enforming the iudgement alreadie either satisfied, or by similitudes not to be satisfied. For
my part, I doo not doubt, when <name rend="italic">Antonius</name> and
<name rend="italic">Crassus, </name> the great forefathers of <name rend="italic">Cicero</name> in eloquence,
the one (as <name rend="italic">Cicero</name> testifieth of them) pretended not
to knowe Art, the other not to set by it, (because
with a plaine sensiblenesse, they might winne credit of popular eares, which credit, is the nearest
steppe to perswasion, which perswasion, is the
chiefe marke of Oratorie) I do not doubt I say, but
that they vsed these knacks verie sparingly, which
who doth generally vse, any man may see doth dance
to his owne musick, and so to be noted by the audience, more careful to speak curiously
then truly. Vndoubtedly (at least to my opinion vndoubtedly ) I
haue found in diuers smal learned Courtiers, a more
sound stile, then in some professors of learning, of
which I can gesse no other cause, but that the Courtier following that which by practise he
findeth fittest to nature, therein(though he know it not)doth
according to art, thogh not by art:  where the other
vsing art to shew art and not hide art (as in these cases he shuld do) flieth from nature, &amp; indeed abuseth
art.
</p>

<p>But what?  methinks I deserue to be pounded for
straying from <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>, to <name rend="italic">Oratory: </name>but both haue such
an affinitie in the wordish consideration, that I think
this digression will make my meaning receiue the
fuller vnderstanding:  which is not to take vpon me
to teach <name rend="italic">Poets</name> how they should do, but only finding
my selfe sicke among the rest, to shew some one or
two spots of the common infection growne among
the most part of writers, that acknowledging our
selues somewhat awry, wee may bende to the right
vse both of matter and manner. Whereto our language giueth vs great occasion, being indeed
capable of any excellent exercising of it.  I knowe some
will say it is a mingled language: And why not, so
much the better, taking the best of both the other ?
Another will say, it wanteth Grammer. Nay truly
it hath that praise that it wants not Grammer ; for
Grammer it might haue, but it needs it not, being so
easie in it selfe, and so voyd of those combersome
differences of <name rend="italic">Cases</name>, <name rend="italic">Genders</name>,
<name rend="italic">Moods</name>, <name rend="italic"> &amp; Tenses</name>, which
I thinke was a peece of the Tower of <name rend="italic">Babilons</name> curse,
that a man should be put to schoole to learn his mother tongue. But for the vttering sweetly and
properly the conceit of the minde, which is the end of
speech, that hath it equally with any other tongue
in the world. And is perticularly happy in compositions of two or three wordes togither, neare the
Greeke, farre beyond the Latine, which is one of
the greatest bewties can be in a language.
</p>

<p>Now of versefying, there are two sorts, the one auncient, the
other moderne. The auncient marked the quantitie
of each sillable, and according to that, framed his
verse: The moderne, obseruing onely number,
with some regard of the accent; the chiefe life of it,
standeth in that like sounding of the words, which
we call Rime. Whether of those be the more excellent, wold bear many speeches, the ancient no doubt
more fit for Musick, both words and time obseruing
quantitie, and more fit, liuely to expresse diuers passions by the low or loftie sound of the well-wayed
sillable. The latter likewise with his rime striketh
a certaine Musicke to the eare:  and in fine, since
it dooth delight, though by an other way, it obtaineth the same purpose, there being in either
sweetnesse, and wanting in neither maiestie. Truly the
English before any Vulgare language, I know is fit
for both sorts:  for, for the auncient, the <name rend="italic">Italian</name> is so
full of Vowels, that it must euer be combred with
<name rend="italic">Elisions. </name>  The <name rend="italic">Duch</name> so of the other side with
Consonants, that they cannot yeeld the sweete slyding, fit
for a Verse. The <name rend="italic">French</name> in his whole language, hath
not one word that hath his accent in the last sillable,
sauing two, called <name rend="italic">Antepenultima</name>;  and little more
hath the <name rend="italic">Spanish</name>, and therefore verie gracelesly may
they vse <name rend="italic">Dactiles</name>. The English is subiect to none of
these defects. Now for Rime, though we doo not
obserue quantitie, yet wee obserue the Accent verie
precisely, which other languages either cannot do,
or will not do so absolutely. That <name rend="italic">Caesura</name>, or breathing
place in the midst of the Verse, neither <name rend="italic">Italian</name>
nor <name rend="italic">Spanish</name> haue:  the <name rend="italic">French</name> and we, neuer almost
faile off. Lastly, euen the verie Rime it selfe, the <name rend="italic">Italian</name> cannot put it
in the last sillable, by the <name rend="italic">French</name> named the <name rend="italic">Masculine</name> Rime; but still in the next to the
last, which the <name rend="italic">French</name> call the <name rend="italic">Female</name>; or the next before that,
which the Italian <name rend="italic">Sdrucciola: </name> the example
of the former, is <name rend="italic">Buono</name>, <name rend="italic"> Suono</name>, of the <name rend="italic">Sdrucciola, </name> is
<name rend="italic">Femina, Semina. </name>  The <name rend="italic">French</name> of the other side, hath
both the Male as <name rend="italic">Bon</name>, <name rend="italic"> Son</name>; and the Female, as <name rend="italic">Plaise, </name>
<name rend="italic">Taise</name>;but the <name rend="italic">Sdrucciola</name> he hath not: where the English hath
all three, as <name rend="italic">Du</name>, <name rend="italic"> Trew</name>, <name rend="italic"> Father</name>, <name rend="italic"> Rather</name>,
<name rend="italic"> Motion</name>, <name rend="italic"> Potion </name>, with much more which might be sayd,
but that alreadie I finde the triflings of this discourse
is much too much enlarged.
</p>

<p>So that since the euer praise woorthie <name rend="italic">Poesie</name> is full of vertue
breeding delightfulnesse, and voyd of no gift that ought to be
in the noble name of learning, since the blames layd
against it, are either false or feeble, since the cause
why it is not esteemed in England, is the fault of Poet-apes, not <name rend="italic">Poets</name>. Since lastly our tongue is most fit
to honour <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>, and to bee honoured by <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>,
I coniure you all that haue had the euill luck to read
this inck-wasting toy of mine, euen in the name of
the nine <name rend="italic">Muses</name>, no more to scorne the sacred misteries of <name rend="italic">Poesie</name>.
No more to laugh at the name of <name rend="italic">Poets</name>, as though they were next inheritors to fooles;
no more to iest at the reuerent title of a Rimer, but
to beleeue with <name rend="italic">Aristotle, </name> that they were the auncient Treasurers of the Grecians diuinitie; to beleeue
with <name rend="italic">Bembus</name>, that they were first bringers in of all
<name rend="italic">Ciuilitie</name>; to beleeue with <name rend="italic">Scalliger</name> that
no <name rend="italic">Philosophers</name> precepts can sooner make you an honest man,
then the reading of <name rend="italic">Virgil</name>; to beleeue with <name rend="italic">Clauserus</name> the
Translator of <name rend="italic">Cornutus</name>, that it pleased the
heauenly deitie by <name rend="italic">Hesiod</name> and <name rend="italic">Homer</name>, vnder the vaile
of Fables to giue vs all knowledge, <name rend="italic">Logicke, Rhetoricke, Philosophie, </name>
naturall and morall, and <foreign xml:lang="lat">Quid non?</foreign>
To beleeue with me, that there are many misteries
contained in <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>, which of purpose were written darkly, least by prophane wits it should be
abused:  To beleeue with <name rend="italic">Landin</name>, that they are so beloued of the Gods,
that whatsoeuer they write, proceeds of a diuine furie. Lastly, to beleeue themselues when they tell you they will
make you immortal by their verses. Thus doing, your name shall
florish in the Printers shops. Thus doing, you shall be
of kin to many a Poeticall Preface.  Thus doing, you
shal be most faire, most rich, most wise, most all: you
shall dwel vpon Superlatiues. Thus doing, though
you be <foreign xml:lang="lat">Libertino patre natus</foreign>, you shall sodeinly grow
<foreign xml:lang="lat">Herculea proles. Si quid mea Carmina possunt. </foreign>  Thus do-
ing your soule shall be placed with <name rend="italic">Dantes Beatrix</name>,
or <name rend="italic">Virgils Anchises</name>. But if (fie of such a but) you bee
borne so neare the dull-making <name rend="italic">Cataract</name> of <name rend="italic">Nilus</name>,
that you cannot heare the Planet-like Musicke of
<name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>; if you haue so earth-creeping a mind that it
cannot lift it selfe vp to looke to the skie of <name rend="italic">Poetrie</name>,
or rather by a certaine rusticall disdaine, wil become
such a mome, as to bee a <name rend="italic">Momus</name> of <name rend="italic">Poetrie: </name> then
though I will not wish vnto you the Asses eares of
<name rend="italic">Midas</name>, nor to be driuen by a <name rend="italic">Poets</name> verses as <name rend="italic">Bubonax</name>
was, to hang himselfe, nor to be rimed to death as is
said to be done in <name rend="italic">Ireland</name>, yet thus much Curse I
must send you in the behalfe of all <name rend="italic">Poets</name>, that while
you liue, you liue in loue, and neuer get fauour,
for lacking skill of a Sonet, and when you
die, your memorie die from the earth
for want of an Epitaphe. </p>
