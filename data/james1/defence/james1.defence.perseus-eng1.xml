    <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
    <p><hi rend="italic">I HAVE no humour to play the Curious in a forraine Commonwealth, or, vnre-
      quested, to carry any hand in my neighbours affaires. It hath more congruitie with Royall
      dignitie, whereof God hath giuen mee the honour, to prescribe Lawes at home for my Subiects,
      rather then to furnish forraine Kingdomes and people with counsels. Howbeit, my late entire
      affection to</hi> K. Henry IV. <hi rend="italic">of happy memorie, my most honoured brother,
      and my exceeding sorrow for the most detestable parricide acted vpon the sacred person of a
      King, so complete in all heroicall and Princely vertues; as also the remembrance of my owne
      dangers, incurred by the practise of conspiracies flowing from the same source, hath wrought
      mee to sympathize with my friends in their grieuous occurrents: no doubt so much more
      dangerous, as they are lesse apprehended and left of Kings themselues, euen when the danger
      hangeth ouer their owne heads. Vpon whom, in case the power and vertue of my aduertisements be
      not able effectually to worke, at least many millions of children and people yet vn- borne,
      shall beare me witnesse, that in these dangers of the highest nature and straine, I haue not
      bene defectiue: and that neither the subuersions of States, nor the murthers of Kings, which
      may vnhappily betide hereafter, shall haue so free passage in the world for want of timely
      aduertisement before. For touching my particular, my rest is vp, that one of the maynes for
      which God hath aduanced me vpon the loftie stage of the supreme Throne, is, that my words
      vtteredfrom so eminent a placefor Gods honour, most shamefully traduced and vilified in his
      owne Deputies and Lieutenants, might with greater facilitie be conceiued.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Now touching</hi> France, <hi rend="italic">faire was the hope which I
      conceiued of the States assem- bled in Parliament at</hi> Paris: <hi rend="italic">That
      calling to minde the murthers of their Noble Kings, and the warres of the League which
      followed the Popes fulminations, as when a great storme of haile powerth downe after a
      Thunder-cracke, and a world of writings addressed to iustife the parricides, and the
      dethronings of kings, they would haue ioyned heads, hearts &amp; hands together, to hammer out
      some apt and wholesome remedy against so many fearefull attempts and practises. To my hope was
      added no little ioy, when I was giuen to vnderstand the third</hi> Estate <hi rend="italic"
      >had preferred an Article or Bill, the tenor and substance whereof was concerning the means
      whereby the people</hi>
     <pb n="170"/>
     <hi rend="italic">might bee vnwitched of this pernicious opinion</hi>; That Popes may tosse the
     French King his Throne like a tennis ball, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> that killing of Kings is
     an acte meritorious to the purchase of the crowne of Martyrdome. <hi rend="italic">But in fine,
      the proiect was en- countred with successe deane contrary to Expectation. For this Article of
      the third Estate, like a sigh of libertie breathing her last, served only so much the more to
      in- thrall the Crowne, and to make the bondage more grieuous and sensible then before. Euen as
      those medicines which worke no ease to the patient, doe leaue the disease in much worse
      tearmes: so this remedy inuented and tendred by the third Estate, did onely exasperate the
      present malady of the State; for so much as the operation and vertue of the wholesome remedy
      was ouermatched with peccant humours, then stirred by the force of thwarting and crossing
      opposition. Yea much better had it bene, the matter had not bene stirred at all, then after it
      was once on foot and in motion, to give the Trewth leaue to lye gasping and sprawling vnder
      the violence of a forraine faction. For the opinion by which the Crownes of Kings are made
      subiect vnto the Popes will and power, was then auowed in a most Honourable Assembly, by the
      auerment of a Prelate in great authoritie, and of no lesse learning: He did not plead the
      cause as a priuate person, but as one by representation that stood for the whole body of the
      Clergie; was there applauded, and seconded with approbation of the Nobilitie; no resolution
      taken to the contrary, or in barre to his plea. After praises and thankes from the Pope,
      followed the printing of his eloquent harangue or Oration, made in full Parliament: a set
      discourse, maintaining Kings to be deposeable by the Pope, if he speake the word. The said
      Oration was not onely Printed</hi> with the Kings priui- ledge, <hi rend="italic">but was
      likewise addressed to mee by the Author and Orator himselfe; who presupposed the reading
      thereof would forsooth driue me to say</hi>, Lord Cardinall, in this high subiect your Honour
     hath satisfied me to the full. <hi rend="italic">All this poysed in the ballance of equall
      iudgement, why may not I trewly and freely affirme, the said Estates assembled in Parliament,
      haue set Royall Maiestie vpon a doubtfull chance, or left it resting vpon vncertaine tearmes:
      and that now if the doctrine there maintained by the Clergie should beare any pawme, it may
      lawfully be doubted, who is King in</hi> France ? <hi rend="italic">For I make no question,
      hee is but a titular King that raigneth onely at an others discretion, and whose Princely head
      the Pope hath power to bare of his Regall Crowne. In temporall matters, how can one be
      Soueraigne, that may be fleeced of all his Temporalties by any superior power? But let men at
      a neere sight marke the pith and marrow of the Article proposed by the third Estate, and they
      shall soone perceiue the skilfull Architects thereof aymed onely to make their King a trew and
      reall King, to bee recognised for Soueraigne within his owne Realme, and that kill- ing their
      King might no longer passe the muster of workes acceptable to God.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">But by the vehement instance and strong current of the Clergie and Nobles,
      this was borne downe as a pernicious Article, as a cause of Schisme, as a gate which openeth
      to all sorts of Heresies: yea, there it was maintained tooth and naile, that in case the
      doctrine of this Article might goefor currant doctrine, it must follow, that for many aages
      past in sequence, the Church hath beene the kingdome of Antichrist, and</hi>
     <pb n="171"/>
     <hi rend="italic">the synagogue of Satan. The Pope vpon so good issue of the cause, had reason,
      I trow, to addresse his Letters of triumph vnto the Nobilitie and Clergie, who had so farre
      aprrooued themselues faithfull to his Holinesse; and to vaunt withall, that hee had nipped
      Christian Kings in the Crowne, that hee had giuen them checke with mate, through the
      magnanimous resolution of this courageous Nobilitie, by whose braue making head, the third
      Estate had beene so valiantly forced to give ground. In a scornefull reproach hee qualified
      the Deputies of the third Estate</hi>, nebulones ex foece plebis,<note anchored="true"
      place="foot">I haue receiued aduertisement from diuers parts, that in the Popes letters to the
      Nobitie these wordes were extant, howsoeuer they haue bin left out in the impression, &amp;
      rased out of the copies of the said letters.</note> a sort or a number of knaues, the very
     dregges of the base vulgar, a packe of people, presuming to personate well affected Subiects,
     and men of deepe vnderstanding, and to reade their masters a learned Lecture. <hi rend="italic"
      >Now it is no wonder, that, in so good an office and loyall cariage towards their King, the
      third Estate hath outgone the Clergie. For the Clergie denie themselues to haue any ranke
      among the Subiects of the King: they stand for a Soueraigne out of the Kingdome, to whom as to
      the Lord Paramount they owe suite and seruice: they are bound to ad- uance that Monarchie, to
      the bodie whereof they properly apperteine as parts or mem- bers, as elsewhere I have written
      more at large. But for the Nobilitie, the Kings right arme, to prostitute and set as it were
      to sale the dignitie of their King, as if the arme should giue a thrust vnto the head; I say
      for the Nobilitie to hold and main- taine euen in Parliament, their King is liable to
      deposition by any forreine power or Potentate, may it not passe among the strangest miracles
      and rarest wonders of the world? For that once granted, this consequence is good and
      necessarie; That in case the King, once lawfully deposed, shall stand vpon the defensiue, and
      hold out for his right, he may then lawfully be murthered. Let mee then here freely professe
      my opinion, and this it is: That now the French Nobilitie may seeme to haue some reason to
      disrobe themselues of their titles, and to transferre them by resignation vnto the third
      Estate. For that body of that third Estate alone hath caried a right noble heart: in as much
      as they could neither be tickled with promises, nor terrified by threatnings, from resolute
      standing to those fundamentall points and reasons of State, which most concerne the honour of
      their King, and the securitie of his person.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Of all the Clergie, the man that hath most abandoned, or set his honour to
      sale, the man to whom France is least obliged, is the</hi> Lord Cardinall <hi rend="italic"
      >of</hi> Perron: <hi rend="italic">a man other- wise inferiour to few in matter of learning,
      and in the grace of a sweete style. This man in two seuerall Orations, whereof the one was
      pronounced before the Nobilitie, the other had audience before the third Estate, hath set his
      best wits on worke, to draw that doctrine into all hatred and infamie, which teacheth Kings to
      be indeposeable by the Pope. To this purpose hee termes the same doctrine, a breeder of
      Schismes, a gate that openeth to make way, and to giue entrance vnto all heresies; in briefe,
      a doctrine to bee held in so high a degree of detestation, that rather then he and his fellow-
      Bishops will yeeld to the signing thereof, they will bee contented like Martyrs to burne at a
      stake. At which resolution, or obstinacie rather in his opinion, I am in a</hi>
     <pb n="172"/>
     <hi rend="italic">manner amased, more then I can be mooued for the like</hi> brauado <hi
      rend="italic">in many other: for- asmuch as hee was many yeeres together, a follower of the
      late King, euen when the King followed a contrary Religion, and was deposed by the Pope: as
      also because not long before, in a certaine Assemblie holden at the Iacobins in Paris, hee
      withstood the Popes Nuntio to his face, when the said Nuntio laboured to make this doctrine,
      touching the Popes temporall Soueraigntie, passe for an Article of Faith. But in both
      Orations, hee singeth a contrary song, and from his owne mouth passeth sentence of
      condemnation against his former course and profession. I suppose, not without sollide
      iudgement; as one that heerein hath well accommodated himself to the times: For as in the
      reigne of the late King, hee durst not offer to broach this doctrine (such was his fore-wit;)
      so now he is bold to proclaime and publish it in Parliament vnder the reigne of the said Kings
      sonne; whose tender yeeres and late succession to the Crowne, doe make him lie the more open
      to iniuries, and the morefacill to be circum- uented: Such is now his afterwisedome.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Of these two Orations, that made in presence of the Nobilitie he hath, for
      feare of incurring the Popes displeasure, cautelously suppressed. For therein he hath beene
      somewhat prodigall in affirming this doctrine maintained by the Clergie, to bee but
      problematicall; and in taking vpon him to auouch, that Catholikes of my Kingdome are bound to
      yeeld me the honour of obedience: Whereas on the other side, he is not ignorant, how this
      doctrine of deposing Princes and Kings, the Pope holdeth for meerely necessarie, and
      approoueth not by any means Alleagiance to bee performed vnto mee by the Catholikes of my
      Kingdome. Yea if credit may be giuen vnto the abridgement of his other Oration published,
      wherein he paralells the Popes power in receiuing honours in the name of the Church, with the
      power of the Venetian Duke in receiuing honours in the name of that most renowned Republike;
      no marueile that when this Oration was dispatched to the presse, he commanded the same to be
      gelded of this clause and other like, for feare of gluing his Holinesse any offensiue
      distaste.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">His pleasure therefore was, and content withall, that his Oration imparted
      to the third Estate, should be put in Print, and of his courtesie he vouchsafed to addresse
      vnto me a copie of the same. Which after I had perused, Ifoorthwith well perceiued, what and
      how great discrepance there is betweene one man that perorateth from the ingenuous and sincere
      disposition of a sound heart, and an other that flaunteth in nourishing speech with inward
      checkes of his owne conscience: For euery where he contradicts himselfe, and seemes to be
      afraid lest men should picke out his right meaning.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">First, he grants this Question is not hitherto decided by the holy
      Scriptures, or by the Decrees of the ancient Church, or by the analogie of other
      Ecclesiasticall proceed- ings: and neuerthelesse hee confidently doeth affirme, that whosoeuer
      maintaine this doctrine to be wicked and abhominable, that Popes haue no power to put Kings by
      their supreame Thrones, they teach men to beleeue, there hath not bene any Church for many
      aages past, and that indeed the Church is the very Synagogue of Antichrist.</hi><note
      anchored="true" place="foot">In 12. seuerall passages the L. Card. seemeth to speake against
      his owne conscience. Pag. 85.</note>
     <pb n="173"/>
     <hi rend="italic">Secondly, he exhorts his hearers to hold this doctrine at least for
      problematicall, and not necessary: and yet herein he calls them to all humble submission vnto
      the iudgement of the Pope and Clergie, by whom the cause hath bene already put out of all
      question, as out of all hunger and cold.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Thirdly, he doeth auerre, in case this Article be authorized, it makes the
      Pope in good consequence to bee the Antichrist: and yet he grants that many of the French are
      tolerated by the Pope to dissent in this point from his Holinesse; <note anchored="true"
       place="foot"> Pag. 99.</note> prouided, their doctrine be not proposed as necessary, and
      materiall to faith; As if the Pope in any sort gaue toleration to hold any doctrine contrary
      to his owne, and most of all that doctrine which by consequence inferres himselfe to be the
      Antichrist.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Fourthly, he protesteth forwardnesse to vndergoe the flames of Martyrdome,
      rather then to signe this doctrine, which teacheth Kings Crownes to sit faster on their heads,
      then to be stirred by any Papal power whatsoeuer: and yet saith withal, the Pope winketh at
      the French, by his toleration to hold this dogmaticall point for prob- lematicall. And by this
      meanes, the Martyrdome that hee affecteth in this cause, will prooue but a problematicall
      Martyrdome, whereof question might grow very well, whether it were to be mustered with
      grieuous crimes, or with phreneticall passions of the braine, or with deserued
      punishments.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Fiftly, he denounceth Anathema, dischargeth maledictions like haile-shot,
      against parricides of Kings: and yet elsewhere hee layes himselfe open to speake of Kings
      onely so long as they stand Kings. But who doeth not know that a King deposed is no longer
      King ? And so that limme of Satan, which murthered</hi> Henry <hi rend="italic">the</hi> III.
      <hi rend="italic">then vn-king'd by the Pope, did not stabbe a King to death.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Sixtly, he doeth not allow a King to be made away by murder: and yet he
      thinks it not much out of the way, to take away al meanes whereby he might be able to stand in
      defence of his life.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Seuenthly, hee abhorreth killing of Kings by apposted throat-cutting, for
      feare lest body and soule should perish in the same instant: and yet he doth not mislike their
      killing in a pitcht field, and to haue them slaughtered in a set battaile: For he
      presupposeth, no doubt out of his charitable mind, that by this meanes the soule of a poore
      King so dispatched out of the way, shall instantly flie vp to heauen.</hi><note
      anchored="true" place="foot">Pag. 95. 97.</note>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Eightly, he saith a King deposed, retaineth stil a certaine internal
      habitude and politike impression, by vertue and efficacie whereof he may, being once reformed
      and become a new man, he restored to the lawfull vse and practise of Regalitie. Whereby hee
      would beare vs in hand, that when aforraine Prince hath inuaded and rauenously seised the
      kingdome into his hands, he will not onely take pittie of his predecessour to saue his life,
      but will also proue so kindhearted, vpon sight of his repentance, to re- store his kingdome
      without fraud or guile.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Ninthly, he saith euery where in his Discourse, that he dealeth not in the
      cause, otherwise then as a problematicall discourser, and without any resolution one way or
      other: and yet with might and maine hee contends for the opinion, that leaues the</hi>
     <pb n="174"/>
     <hi rend="italic">States and Crownes of Kings controulable by the Pope: refutes objections,
      propounds the authoritie of Popes and Councils, by name the Lateran Councill vnder</hi>
     Innocent. III. <hi rend="italic">as also the consent of the Church. And to crosse the Churches
      iudgement, is, in his opinion to bring in schisme, and to leave the world without a Church for
      many hundred yeeres together: which (to my vnderstanding) is to speake with resolution, and
      without all hesitation.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Tenthly, he acknowledgeth none other cause of sufficient validitie for the
      deposing of a King, besides heresie, apostasie, and infidelitie: neuerthelesse that Popes haue
      power to displace Kings for heresie and apostasie, hee proueth by examples of Kings whom the
      Pope hath curbed with deposition, not for heresie, but for matrimoniall causes, for ciuill
      pretences, and for lacke of capacitie.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Eleuenthly, hee alledgeth euerywhere passages, as well of holy Scripture,
      as of the Fathers and moderne histories; but so impertinent, and with so little trewth, as
      here- after wee shall cause to appeare, that for a man of his deepe learning and knowledge, it
      seemeth not possible so to speake out of his iudgement. </hi></p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">Lastly, whereas all this hath bene hudled and heaped together into one
      masse, to currie with the Pope: yet hee suffereth diuers points to fall from his lips, which
      may well distast his Holinesse in the highest degree. As by name, where he prefers the
      authoritie of the Councill before that of the Pope, and makes his iudgement inferiour to the
      iudgement of the French; as in fit place hereafter shalbe shewed. Againe, where he
      representeth to his hearers the decrees of Popes and Councils already passed concerning this
      noble subiect; and yet affirmes that he doth not debate the question, but as a Questionist,
      and without resolution: As if a Cardinal should be afraid to be positiue, and to speake in
      peremptory straines, after Popes and Councils haue once decided the Question: Or as if a man
      should perorate vpon hazard, in a causefor the honour whereof, he would make no difficultie to
      suffer Martyrdome. Adde here- unto, that his Lordship hath alwayes taken the contrary part
      heretofore, and this totall must needs arose, that before the third Estate, his lips looked
      one way, and his con- science another.</hi>
    </p>
    <p><hi rend="italic">All these points, by the discourse which is to follow, and by the ripping
      vp of his Oration (which by Gods assistance I will vndertake) tending to the reproch of Kings,
      and the subuersion of kingdomes, I confidently speake it, shalbe made manifest. Yet doe I not
      conceiue it can any way make for my honour, to enter the lists against a Cardinall: For I am
      not ignorant howfarre a Cardinals Hat, commeth vnder the Crowne and Scepter of a King; For
      well I wot vnto what sublimitie the Scripture hath exalted Kings, when it styles them Gods;
      Whereas the dignitie of a Cardinall is but a late vpstart inuention of man; as I haue
      elsewhere prooued.<note anchored="true" place="foot">In the Preface to my Apologie.</note> But
      I have im- barqued my selfe in this action, mooued thereunto: First, by the common interest of
      Kings in the cause it selfe: Then by the L. Cardinall, who speaketh not in this Ora- tion as a
      priuate person, but as one representing the body of the Clergie and Nobilitie by whom the
      cause hath bene wonne, and the garland borne awayfrom the third Estate:</hi>
     <pb n="175"/>
     <hi rend="italic">Againe, by mine owne particular; because he is pleased to take me vp for a
      sower of dissention, and a persecutour, vnder whom the Church is hardly able to fetch her
      breath; yea, for one by whom the Catholikes of my Kingdome are compelled to endure all sorts
      of punishments; and withal he tearmes this Article of the third Estate, a monster with a
      fishes taile that came swimming out of England: Last of all, by the present state of France;
      because France being now reduced to so miserable tearmes, that it is now become a crime for a
      Frenchman to stand for his King; it is a necessary duetie of her neighbours to speak in her
      cause, and to make triall whether they can put life into the trweth now dying, and ready to be

    <head> A Remonstrance For The Right Of Kings, And The Independance Of Their Crownes. Against An
     Oration Or The Most Illvstriovs Card. Of Perron, Pronovnced In The Chamber Of The Third Estate.
     Ian. 15. 1615. </head>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
     <p>THE L. Cardinall euen in the first passage of his Oration, hath laid a firme foun- dation,
       <hi rend="italic">That Ecclesiastics in France are more deepely obliged to the King, then the
       Nobilitie, and third Estate</hi>: His reason; Because the Clergie doe sweetly enioy their
      dignities and promotions, with all their infinite wealth, of the Kings meere grace, without
      all danger, and with faire immunities; whereas the other two Orders hold their offices by a
      chargeable and burdensome title or tenure, euen to the great expence of their blood, and of
      their substance. But see now, how loose and weake a frame he hath erected and pinned together,
      vpon his firme and solide foundation: <hi rend="italic">Ergo</hi>, the third Estate is to lay
      all care to prouide remedies against apposted cut-throats, vpon the Clergy; and the said
      remedies (as he boldly affirms) must be deriued from the laws of conscience, which may carry
      an effectual acting or operatiue efficacie vpon the soule, and not from ciuil or temporall
      punishments. Now this consequence limpeth like a lame creple after the premises: For it is no
      vsuall and common matter, to see men that are deepest in obligation, performe their duties and
      couenants with most fidelity. Againe, were it graunted the Clergie had well hitherto
      demonstrated their carefull watch- ing ouer the life and honour of their Prince; yet is it not
      for spirituall punish- ments thundered by Ecclesiastics, to bind the hands of the ciuill
      Magistrate, nor to stop the current of temporall punishments: which ordinarily doe carrie a
      greater force and vertue to the bridling of the wicked, then the apprehension of Gods
      iudgement. </p>
     <p>The third Estate therefore, by whom all the officers of France are properly represented, as
      to whom the administration of iustice and protection of the Kings rights and Honour doth
      appertaine, can deserue no blame in carrying so watch- full an eye, by their wholesome remedie
      to prouide for the safetie of the King, and for the dignitie of his Crowne. For if the Clergie
      shall not stand to their tackle, but shrinke when it commeth to the push of their duetie; who
      shall charge them- selves with carefull foresight and preuention of mischiefes ? Shall not the
      people? Now, haue not all the calamities, which the third Estate haue sought prouidently to
      preuent; haue they not all sprung from the Clergie, as from their proper and naturall
      fountaine ? From whence did the last ciuill warres, wherein a world of <pb n="177"/> blood was
      not more profusely then prodigiously and vnnaturally spilt, and wherein the parricide of King
       <hi rend="italic">Henrie III</hi>. was impiously and abominably committed; from whence did
      those bloodie warres proceed, but from the deposing of the said King by the Head of the Church
      ? Were they not Prelats, Curats, and Confessours; were they not Ecclesiastics, who partly by
      seditious preachments, and partly by secret confessions, powred many a iarre of oyle vpon this
      flame ? Was not he that killed the forenamed King, was not he one of the Clergie ? Was not <hi
       rend="italic">Guignard</hi> a Iesuite ? Was not <hi rend="italic">Iohn Chastel</hi> brought
      vp in the same schoole? Did not <hi rend="italic">Rauaillac</hi> that monster of men, vpon
      interrogatories made at his examination; among the rest, by whom he had beene so diabolically
      tempted and stirred vp to his most execrable attempt and act of extreme horror: did not he
      referre his examiners to the Sermons made the Lent next before, where they might be satis-
      fied concerning the causes of his abominable vndertaking and execution ? Are not <hi
       rend="italic">Bellarmine, Eudaemonoiohannes, Suarez, Becanus, Mariana</hi>, with such other
      monsters, who teach the doctrine of parricides, vphold the craft of Ianus-like Equiuocations
      in Courts of Iustice, and in secret confessions: are they not all Clerics ? are not all their
      bookes approoued and allowed, as it were by a corpora- tion or grosse companie of Doctors,
      with their signes manuel to the said bookes ? What were the heads, the chiefe promoters, the
      complices of the powder-con- spiracie in my Kingdome ? were they not Ecclesiastics ? Hath not
       <hi rend="italic">Faux</hi> by name, a confederate of the same damned crew; hath not he
      stoutly stood to the gun- ners part, which then he was to act in that most dolefull Tragedie,
      with asseuera- tion of a conscience well assured and setled, touching the lawfulnesse of his
      enter- prise? Did he not yeild this reason? to wit, because he had bin armed with instruction
      of musket proofe in the case, before he made passage ouer from the Low Countries ? Is it not
      also the generall beleefe of that Order, that Clerics are exempted from the condition of
      Subiects to the King ? Nay, is it not confessed by the L. Cardinall<note anchored="true"
       place="foot">Pag. 7.</note> himselfe, that King-killers haue ingaged themselues to vndertake
      the detestable act of parricide vnder a false credence of Religion, as beeing instructed by
      their schoolemasters in Religion ? And who were they but Ecclesiasticall persons ? All this
      presupposed as matter of trewth, I draw this conclusion: Howsoeuer no small number of the
      French Clergie may perhaps beare the affection of louing Subiects to their King, and may not
      suffer the Cleri- call character to deface the impression of naturall allegiance; yet, for so
      much as the Order of Clerics is dipped in a deeper die, and beareth a worse tincture of
      daungerous practises then the other Orders; the third Estate had beene greatly wanting to
      their excellent prouidence and wisedome, if they should haue relin- quished and transferred
      the care of designements and proiects for the life of their King, and the safety of his
      Crowne, to the Clergie alone. Moreouer, the Clergie standeth bound to referre the iudgement of
      all matters of controuersie, to the sentence of the Pope, in this cause beeing a partie, and
      one that pretendeth <pb n="178"/> Crownes to depend vpon his Mitre. What hope then might the
      third Estate conceiue, that his Holinesse would passe against his owne cause, when his iudge-
      ment of the controuersie had beene sundrie times before published and testified to the world ?
      And whereas the plot or modell of remedies proiected by the third Estate, and the Kings
      Officers, hath not prooued sortable in the euent: was it because the said remedies were not
      good and lawfull ? No verily: but because the Clergie refused to become contributors of their
      duty and meanes to the grand seruice. Likewise, for that after the burning of bookes,
      addressed to iustifie re- bellious people, traytors, and parricides of Kings; neuerthelesse
      the authors of the said bookes are winked at, and backt with fauour. Lastly, for that some
      wretched parricides drinke off the cuppe of publike iustice; whereas to the fire- brands of
      sedition, the sowers of this abominable doctrine, no man saith so much as blacke is their eye. </p>
     <p>It sufficiently appeareth, as I supose, by the former passage, that his Lordship exhorting
      the third Estate to referre the whole care of this Regall cause vnto the Clergie, hath tacked
      his frame of weake ioynts and tenons to a very worthy but wrong foundations. Howbeit, he
       laboureth<note anchored="true" place="foot">Page 9.</note> to fortifie his exhortation with a
      more weake and feeble reason: For to make good his proiect he affirmes, that matters and
      maximes out of all doubt and question may not be shuffled together with points in
      controueresie. Now his rules indubitable are two: The first, It is not lawfull to murther
      Kings for any cause whatsoeuer: This he confirmeth by the example of <hi rend="italic"
       >Saul</hi> (as he saith) deposed from his Throne, whose life or limbs <hi rend="italic"
       >Dauid</hi> neuerthelesse durst not once hurt or wrong for his life: Likewise he confirmes
      the same by a Decree of the Councill held at Constance: <note anchored="true" place="foot"
       >Conc. Constan. Sess. 15.</note> His other point indu- bitable; The Kings of France are
      Soueraignes in all Temporall Soueraigntie, within the French Kingdome, and hold not by fealtie
      either of the Pope, as hau- ing received or obliged their Crownes vpon such tenure and
      condition, or of any other Prince in the whole world; Which point, neuerthelesse he takes not
      for certaine and indubitable, but onely according to humane and historicall certain- tie. Now
      a third point he makes to be so full of controuersie, and so farre within the circle of
      disputable questions, as it may not be drawne into the ranke of classicall and authenticall
      points, for feare of making a certaine point doubtfull, by shuffling and iumbling therewith
      some point in controuersie. Now the ques- tion so disputable, as he pretendeth, is this: A
      Christian Prince breaks his oath solemnely taken to God, both to liue and to die in the
      Catholique Religion: Say this Prince turnes Arrian, or Mahometan, fals to proclaime open
      warre, and to wage battell with Iesus Christ: Whether may such a Prince be declared to haue
      lost his Kingdome, and who shall declare the Subjects of such a Prince to be quit of their
      oath of allegiance ? The L. Cardinall holds the affirmatiue, and makes no bones to maintaine,
      that all other parts of the Catholique Church, yea the French Church, euen from the first
      birth of her Theologicall Schooles, to <pb n="179"/>
      <hi rend="italic">Caluins</hi> time and teaching, haue professed that such a Prince may bee
      lawfully remooued from his Throne by the Pope, and by the Councill: and suppose the contrarie
      doctrine were the very Quintessence or spirit of trewth, yet might it not in case of faith be
      vrged and pressed otherwise then by way of problematicall disceptation. That is the summe of
      his Lordships ample discourse: The refuting whereof I am constrained to put off, and referre
      vnto an other place; because he hath serued vs with the same dishes ouer and ouer againe.
      There we shall see the L. Cardinall maketh way to the dispatching of Kings after deposition:
      that <hi rend="italic">Saul</hi> was not deposed, as he hath presumed: that in the Councill of
      Constance there is nothing to the purpose of murthering Soueraigne Princes: that his Lord-
      ship, supposing the French King may be depriued of his Crowne by a superiour power, doth not
      hold his liege Lord to be Soueraine in France: that by the posi- tion of the French Church
      from aage to aage, the Kings of France are not subiect vnto any censure of deposition by the
      Pope: that his Holinesse hath no iust and lawfull pretence to produce, that any Christian King
      holds of him by fealtie, or is obliged to doe the Pope homage for his Crowne. </p>
     <p>Well then, for the purpose; he dwelleth onely vpon the third point pretended questionable,
      and this hee affirmeth: If any shall condemne, or wrappe vnder the solemne curse, the
      abettours of the Popes power to vn-king lawfull and Soueraigne Kings; the same shall runne
      vpon four dangerous rocks of apparent incongruities and absurdities. </p>
     <p>First, he shall offer to force and entangle the consciences of many deuout per- sons: For he
      shall binde them to beleeue and sweare that doctrine, the contrary whereof is beleeued of the
      whole Church, and hath bene beleeued by their Predecessors.<note anchored="true" place="foot"
       >Pag. 14.</note>
     </p>
     <p>Secondly, he shall ouerturne from top to bottome the sacred authoritie of holy Church, and
      shall set open a gate vnto all sorts of heresie, by allowing Lay- persons a bold libertie to
      be iudges in causes of Religion and Faith: For what is that degree of boldnesse, but open
      vsurping of the Priesthood; what is it but putting of prophane hands vpon the Arke; what is it
      but laying of vnholy fingers vpon the holy Censor for perfumes ? </p>
     <p>Thirdly, hee shall make way to a Schisme, not possible to bee put by and auoyded by any
      humane prouidence. For this doctrine beeing held and pro- fessed by all other Catholiques; how
      can we declare it repugnant vnto Gods word; how can wee hold it impious; how can wee account
      it detestable, but wee shall renounce communion with the Head and other members of the Church;
      yea, we shall confesse the Church in all aages to haue bene the Synagogue of Satan, and the
      spouse of the Deuill ? </p>
     <p>Lastly, by working the establishment of this Article, which worketh an estab- lishment of
      Kings Crownes; He shall not onely worke the intended remedy for the danger of Kings, out of
      all the vertue and efficacie thereof, by weakening of <pb n="180"/> doctrine out of all
      controuersie, in packing it vp with a disputable question; but likewise in stead of securing
      the life and estate of Kings, he shall draw both into farre greater hazards, by the traine or
      sequence of warres, and other calamities, which vsually waite and attend on Schismes. </p>
     <p>The L. Cardinall spends his whole discourse in confirmation of these foure heads, which wee
      now intend to sift in order, and demonstratiuely to prooue that all the said inconueniences
      are meere nullities, matters of imagination, and built vpon false presuppositions. But before
      wee come to the maine, the reader is to be enformed and aduertised, that his Lordship setteth
      a false glosse vpon the question; and propounds the case not onely contrary to the treweth of
      the sub- iect in controuersie, but also to the Popes owne minde and meaning: For he restraines
      the Popes power to depose Kings, onely to cases of Heresie, Apostasie, and persecuting of the
      Church; whereas Popes extend their power to a further distance. They depose Princes for
      infringing, or in any sort diminishing the Priuiledges of Monasteries: witnesse <hi
       rend="italic">Gregorie</hi> the first in the pretended Charter granted to the Abbey of <hi
       rend="italic">S. Medard</hi> at <hi rend="italic">Soissons</hi>; the said Charter beeing
      annexed to his Epistles in the rere. The same hee testifieth in his Epistle to <hi
       rend="italic">Senator</hi>, by name the tenth of the eleuenth booke. They depose for naturall
      dulnesse and lacke of capacitie, wether in-bred and trew indeed, or onely pretended and imag-
      ined: witnesse the glorious vaunt of <hi rend="italic">Gregory</hi> VII. that <hi
       rend="italic">Childeric</hi> King of France was hoysted out of his Throne by Pope <hi
       rend="italic">Zachary,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Caus. 15. Can Alius. Qu. 6.</note>
       Not so much for his wicked life, as for his vnablenesse to beare the weightie burden of so
       great a Kingdome</hi>. They depose for collating of Benefices and Prebends: witnesse the
      great quarrels and sore contentions betweene Pope <hi rend="italic">Innocent</hi> III. and <hi
       rend="italic">Iohn</hi> King of England: as also between <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi> the
      Faire and <hi rend="italic">Boniface</hi> VIII. They depose for adulteries and Matrimoniall
      suites: witnes <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi> I. for the repudiating or casting off his law-
      full wife <hi rend="italic">Bertha</hi>, and marrying in her place with <hi rend="italic"
       >Bertrade</hi> wife to the Earle of Aniou. Finally, faine would I learne into what Heresie or
      degree of Apostasie, either <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> IV. or <hi rend="italic">Frederic
       Barbarossa</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> II. Emperours were fallen, when they were
      smitten with Papall fulminations, euen to the depriuation of their Imperiall Thrones.<note
       anchored="true" place="foot">Paul Aemil. in Phil. 3.</note> What ? was it for Heresie or
      Apostasie, that Pope <hi rend="italic">Martin</hi> IV. bare so hard a hand against <hi
       rend="italic">Peter</hi> King of Arragon, that he acquitted and released the Aragonnois from
      their oath of Alleagiance to <hi rend="italic">Peter</hi> their lawfull King ? Was it for
      Heresie or Apostasie, for Arrianisme or Mahumetisme, that <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> XII. so
      good a King and Father of his Countrey, was put downe by <hi rend="italic">Iulius</hi> the II
      ? Was it for Heresie or Apostasie, that <hi rend="italic">Sixtus</hi> V. vsurped a power
      against Henrie III. euen so farr as to denounce him unkingd; the issue whereof was the
      parricide of that good King, and the most woefull desolation of a most flourish- ing Kingdome
      ? But his Lordship best liked to worke vpon that ground, which to the outward shew and
      appearance, is the most beautifull cause that can be al- leaged for the dishonouring of Kings
      by the weapon of deposition: making him- <pb n="181"/> selfe to beleeue that he acted the part
      of an Orator before personages not much acquainted with ancient and moderne histories, and
      such as little vnderstood the state of the question then in hand. It had therefore beene a
      good warrant for his Lordship, to haue brought some authenticall instrument from the Pope,
      whereby the French might haue beene secured, that his Holinesse renounceth all other causes
      auouchable for the degrading of Kings; and that he will henceforth rest in the case of
      Heresie, for the turning of Kings out of their Free-hold: as also that his Holinesse by the
      same or like instrument might haue certified his pleasure, that hee will not hereafter make
      himselfe Iudge, whether Kings bee tainted with damnable Heresie, or free from Hereticall
      infection. For that were to make him selfe both Iudge and Plaintiffe, that it might be in his
      power to call that doctrine Hereticall, which is pure Orthodoxe: and all for this end, to make
      himselfe master of the Kingdome, and there to settle a Successour, who receiuing the Crowne of
      the Popes free gift and grant, might be tyed thereby to depend altogether vpon his Holinesse.
      Hath not Pope <hi rend="italic">Boniface</hi> VIII. declared in his proud Letters all those to
      be Heretiques, that dare vndertake to afirme, the collating of Prebends apperteineth to the
      King ? It was that Popes grosse errour, not in the fact, but in the right. The like crime
      forsooth was by Popes imputed to the vnhappy Em- perour <hi rend="italic">Henrie</hi> IV. And
      what was the issue of the said imputation? The sonne is instigated thereby to rebell against
      his father, and to impeach the interrement of his dead corps, who neuer in his life had beate
      his braines to trouble the sweet waters of Theologicall fountaines. It is recorded by <hi
       rend="italic">Auentine,</hi><note anchored="true" place="foot">Annal. Boio. Lib. 3. </note>
      that Bishop <hi rend="italic">Virgilius</hi> was declared Heretique, for teaching the Position
      of Antipodes. The Bull <hi rend="italic">Exurge</hi>,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
       >Inuanen. Episcop.</note> marching in the rere of the last Lateran Councel, sets downe this
      Position for one of <hi rend="italic">Luthers</hi> heresies, <hi rend="italic">A new life is
       the best repentance</hi>.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Optima poenitentia noua
       vita.</note>Among the crimes which the Councel of Constance <note anchored="true"
       place="foot">Conc. Constan. Sess. 2.</note> charged Pope <hi rend="italic">Iohn</hi> XXIII.
      withall, one was this, that hee denied the immortalitie of the soule, and that <hi
       rend="italic">so much was pub- liquely, manifestly, and notoriously knowen</hi>. Now if the
      Pope shall be caried by the streame of these or the like errours, and in his Hereticall
      prauitie shall de- pose a King of the contrary opinion, I shall hardly bee perswaded, the said
      King is lawfully deposed. </p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
     <head> THE FIRST INCONVENIENCE EXAMINED.</head>
     <p>THE first inconuenience growing (in the Cardinall his conceit) by entertaining the Article
      of the third Estate (whereby the Kings of France are declared to be indeposeable by any
      superiour power spirituall or temporall) is this: <hi rend="italic">It offereth force to the
       conscience, vnder the penaltie of Anathema, to condemne a doctrine be- leeued and practised
       in the Church, in the continuall current of the last eleuen hun- dred yeeres</hi>. In these
      words he maketh a secret confession, that in the first flue hundred yeeres, the same doctrine
      was neither apprehended by faith, nor ap- <pb n="182"/> prooued by practise. Wherein, to my
      vnderstanding, the L. Cardinall volun- tarily giueth ouer the suite: For the Church in the
      time of the Apostles, their disciples, and successors, for 500. yeeres together, was no more
      ignorant what authoritie the Church is to challenge ouer Emperours and Kings, then at any time
      since in any succeeding aage; in which as pride hath still flowed to the height of a full Sea,
      so puritie of religion and manners hath kept for the most part at a lowe water marke. Which
      point is the rather to be considered, for that during the first 500. yeeres, the Church groned
      vnder the heauy burthen, both of heathen Emperours, and of hereticall Kings; the Visigot Kings
      in Spaine, and the Vandals in Africa. Of whose displeasure the Pope had small reason or cause
      to stand in any feare, beeing so remote from their dominions, and no way vnder the lee of
      their Soueraigntie. </p>
     <p>But let vs come to see, what aide the L. Cardinall hath amassed and piled together out of
      latter histories: prouided wee still beare in mind, that our ques- tion is not of popular
      tumults, nor of the rebellion of subjects making insurrec- tions out of their owne
      discontented spirits and brainesicke humors, nor of law- full Excommunications, nor of
      Canonicall censures and reprehensions; but onely of a iuridicall sentence of deposition,
      pronounced by the Pope, as armed with ordinary and lawfull power to depose, against a
      Soueraigne Prince. </p>
     <p>Now then, The L. Cardinall <note anchored="true" place="foot">Exampl. 1. pag. 18 Euag. hist.
       Eccles. lib. 3. cap. 32.</note> sets on, and giues the first charge with <hi rend="italic"
       >Anasta- sius</hi> the Emperour, whom <hi rend="italic">Euphemius</hi> Patriarke of
      Constantinople would neuer acknowledge for Emperour: (that is to say, would neuer consent he
      should be created Emperour by the helpe of his voice or suffrage) except he would first
      subscribe to the <hi rend="italic">Chalcedon</hi> Creed: notwithstanding the great Empresse
      and Sen- ate sought by violent courses and practises to make him yeeld. And when after- ward
      the said Emperour, contrary to his oath taken, played the relaps by falling into his former
      heresie, and became a persecutor; he was first admonished, and then excommunicated by <hi
       rend="italic">Symmachus</hi> Bishop of Rome. To this the L. Cardinall addes, that when the
      said Emperour was minded to choppe the poison of his hereticall assertions into the publique
      formes of diuine seruice, then the people of Constantinople made an vproare against <hi
       rend="italic">Anastasius</hi> their Emperour; and one of his Commanders by force of armes,
      constrained him to call backe certaine Bishops whom he had sent into banishment before. </p>
     <p>In this first example the L. Cardinall by his good leaue, neither comes close to the
      question, nor salutes it a farre off. <hi rend="italic">Euphemius</hi> was not Bishop of Rome:
       <hi rend="italic">Anastasius</hi> was not deposed by <hi rend="italic">Euphemius</hi>; the
      Patriarch onely made no way to the creating of <hi rend="italic">Anastasius</hi>. The suddaine
      commotion of the base multitude makes nothing, the rebellion of a Greeke Commaunder makes
      lesse, for the author- izing of the Pope to depose a Soueraigne Prince. The Greeke Emperour
      was ex- communicated by Pope <hi rend="italic">Symmachus</hi>: who knowes whether that be trew
      or forged ? For the Pope himselfe is the onely witnesse here produced by the L. <pb n="183"/>
      Cardinall vpon the point: and who knowes not how false, how supposititious, the writings and
      Epistles of the auncient Popes are iustly esteemed ? But graunt it a trewth; yet <hi
       rend="italic">Anastasius</hi> excommunicated by Pope <hi rend="italic">Symmachus</hi>, is not
       <hi rend="italic">Anastasius</hi> deposed by Pope <hi rend="italic">Symmachus</hi>. And to
      make a full answere, I say further, that excommunication denounced by a forraine Bishop,
      against a party not beeing within the limits of his iurisdiction, or one of his owne flocke,
      was not any barre to the party from the communion of the Church, but onely a kind of
      publication, that he the said Bishop in his particular, would hold no further communion with
      any such party. </p>
     <p>For proofe whereof, I produce the Canons of the Councils held at Carthage. In one of the
      said Canons it is thus prouided and ordained;<note anchored="true" place="foot">Nomocan.

      Rome, and <hi rend="italic">Cyrill</hi> of Alexandria, Bishops; for proceeding to sentence
      against <hi rend="italic">Nestorius</hi>, without staying his comming to answere in his owne
      cause. In the same sense likewise, <hi rend="italic">Victor</hi> Bishop of Rome did cut off
      all the Bishops of the East, not from the communion of their owne flocke, but from communion
      with <hi rend="italic">Victor</hi> and the Romane Church. What resemblance, what agreement,
      what propor- tion, betweene this course of excommunication, and that way of vniust fulmina-
      tion which the Popes of Rome haue vsurped against Kings, but yet certaine long courses of time
      after that auncient course ? </p>
     <p>And this may stand for a full answere likewise to the example of <hi rend="italic"
       >Clotharius.</hi><note anchored="true" place="foot">Examp. 2.</note> This ancient King of the
      French, fearing the censures of Pope <hi rend="italic">Agapetus</hi>, erected the Territorie
      of Yuetot vnto the title of a Kingdome, by way of satisfaction for murdering of <hi
       rend="italic">Gualter</hi>, Lord of Yuetot. For this example the L. Cardinall hath ransackt
      records of 900. yeares antiquitie and vpward; in which times it were no hard piece of worke to
      shew, that Popes would not haue any hand, nor so much as a finger in the affaires and acts of
      the French Kings. <hi rend="italic">Gregorie</hi> of Tours that liued in the same aage, hath
      recorded many acts of excesse, and violent iniuries done against Bishops by their Kings, and
      namely against <hi rend="italic">Praetextatus</hi> Bishop of Roan; for any of which iniurious
      prankes then played, the Bishop of <pb n="184"/> Rome durst not reprooue the said Kings with
      due remonstrance. But see heere the words of <hi rend="italic">Gregorie</hi> himselfe to King
       <hi rend="italic">Chilperic: If any of vs, 0 King, shall swarue from the path of Iustice, him
       hast thou power to punish: But in case thou shalt at any time transgresse the lines of
       equitie, who shall once touch thee with re- proofe ? To thee wee speake, but are neuer heeded
       and regarded, except it be thy pleasure: and bee thou not pleased, who shall challenge thy
       greatnesse, but hee that iustly challengeth to bee Iustice it selfe</hi> ? The good Bishop,
      notwithstanding these humble remonstrances, was but roughly entreated, and packt into exile,
      being banished into the Isle of Guernsay. But I am not minded to make any deepe search or
      inquisition, into the titles of the Lords of Yuetot; whose honourable priuiledges and titles
      are the most honourable badges and cognizances of their Ancestours, and of some remarkeable
      seruice done to the Crowne of France: so farre I take them to differ from a satisfaction for
      sinne: And for the purpose I onely affirme, that were the credit of this historie beyond all
      exception, yet makes it nothing to the present question, Wherein the power of deposing, and
      not of excommunicating supreme Kings, is debated. And suppose the King by Charter granted the
      said priuiledges for feare of Excommunication; how is it prooued thereby, that Pope <hi
       rend="italic">Agapetus</hi> had lawfull and ordinary power to depriue him of his Crowne? Nay,
      doubtlesse it was rather a meanes to eleuate and aduance the dignitie of the Crowne of France,
      and to style the French King, a King of Kings, as one that was able to giue the qualitie of
      King, to all the rest of the Nobles and Gentry of his Kingdome. Doeth not some part of the
      Spanish Kings greatnesse, consist in creating of his, great ? </p>
     <p>In the next place followeth <hi rend="italic">Gregorie I</hi>.<note anchored="true"
       place="foot">Examp. 3. pag. 22.</note> who in the 10. Epistle of the 11. booke, confirming
      the priuiledges of the Hospitall at <hi rend="italic">Augustodunum</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
       >Bourgongne</hi>, pro- hibiteth all Kings and Prelates whatsoeuer, to infringe or diminish
      the said priuiledges, in whole or in part. His formall and expresse words bee these: <hi
       rend="italic">If any King, Prelate, Iudge, or any other Secular person, informed of this our
       Constuti- tion, shall presume to goe or doe contrary thereunto, let him bee cast downe from
       his power and dignitie</hi>. I answere; the Lord Cardinall heere wrongs himselfe very much,
      in taking imprecations for Decrees. Might not euen the meanest of the people vse the same
      tenour of words, and say ? If any shall touch the life, or the most sacred Maiestie of our
      Kings, be he Emperour, or be he Pope, let him bee accursed; let him fall from his eminent
      place of authoritie; let him lose his dignitie; let him tumble into beggerie, diseases, and
      all kindes of calamities ? I forbeare to shew how easie a matter it is for Monkes, to forge
      titles after their owne humour, and to their owne liking, for the vpholding and maintaining of
      their priuiledges. As for the purpose, the same <hi rend="italic">Gregorie</hi> citeth in the
      end of his Epistles another priuiledge, of the like stuffe and stampe to the former, granted
      to the Abbey of <hi rend="italic">S. Medard</hi> at Soissons: It is fenced with a like clause
      to the other; But of how great vntrewth, and of how little weight it is, the very date that it
       <pb n="185"/> beareth, makes manifest proofe: For it runs, Dated the yeere of our Lords In-
      carnation 593. the 11. Indiction; whereas the 10. Indiction agreeth to the yeere 593. Besides,
      it was not <hi rend="italic">Gregories</hi> maner to date his Epistles, according to the yeere
      of the Lord. Againe, the said priuiledge was signed by the Bishops of Alexandria and Carthage,
      who neuer knew (as may well bee thought) whether any such Abbey of S. <hi rend="italic"
       >Medard</hi>, or citie of Soissions, was euer built in the world. Moreouer, they signed in
      the thickest of a crowd as it were of Italian Bishops. Lastly, hee that shall reade in this
       <hi rend="italic">Gregories</hi> Epistles, with what spirit of reuerence and humilitie he
      speaketh of Emperours, will hardly beleeue that euer hee armed himselfe with authoritie to
      giue or to take away Kingdomes. Hee styles him- selfe <note anchored="true" place="foot"

      troupes which the Emperour then had in Italie) <hi rend="italic">Zacharias</hi> was repulsed
      and hindered from his deseigne, euen with opproborius and reproachfull termes. His Lordship
      must haue my shallownesse excused, if I reach not his intent by this Allegation; wherein I see
      not one word of deposing from the Empire, or of any sentence pronounced by the Pope. </p>
     <p>Heere are now 712. yeeres expired after the birth of Iesus Christ: in all which long tract
      of time, the L. Cardinal hath not light vpon any instance, which might make for his purpose
      with neuer so little shew: For the example of the Emperor <hi rend="italic"
       >Philippicus</hi><note anchored="true" place="foot">Examp. 5.</note>by the Cardinal alledged
      next in sequence, belongeth to the yeere 713. And thus lies the historie: This Emperour <hi
       rend="italic">Philippicus Bardanes</hi>, was a professed enemie to the worshipping of Images,
      and commanded them to be broken in pieces. In that very time the Romane Empire was ouerthrowen
      in the West, and sore shaken by the Saracenes in the East. Besides those miseries, the
      Emperour was also incumbred with a ciuill and intestine warre. The greatest part of Italie was
      then seized by the Lombards, and the Emperour in Italie had nothing left saue onely the
      Exarchat of Rauenna, and the Dutchie of Rome, then halfe abandoned by reason of the Emperours
      want of forces. Pope <hi rend="italic">Constantine</hi> gripes this occasion whereon to ground
      his greatnesse, and to shake off the yoke of the Emperour his Lord, Undertakes against <hi
       rend="italic">Philippicus</hi> the cause of Images: by a Councel declares the Emperour
      Heretique: Prohibites his rescripts or coine <pb n="186"/> to bee receiued, and to goe current
      in Rome: Forbids his Imperiall statue to bee set vp in the Temple, according to ancient
      custome: The tumult groweth to a height: The Pope is principall promoter of the tumult: In the
      heate of the tumult the Exarche of Rauenna loseth his life. Here see now the mutinie of a
      subiect against his Prince, to pull from him by force and violence a citie of his Empire. But
      who seeth in all this any sentence of deposition from the Imperiall dignitie ? Nay, the Pope
      then missed the cushion, and was disappointed vtterly of his pur- pose: The citie of Rome
      stood firme, and continued still in their obedience to the Emperour. </p>
     <p>About some 12. yeeres after, the Emperour <hi rend="italic">Leo Isauricus</hi>
      <note anchored="true" place="foot">Examp. 6.</note> (whom the Lord of Perron calleth <hi
       rend="italic">Iconoclast</hi>) falles'to fight it out at sharpe, and to prosecute worshippers
      of Images with all extremitie. Vpon this occasion, Pope <hi rend="italic">Gregory 2.</hi> then
      treading in the steps of his predecessor, when he perceiued the citie of Rome to be but
      weakely prouided of men or munition, and the Emperour to haue his hands full in other places,
      found such meanes to make the citie rise in rebellious armes against the Emperour, that he
      made himselfe in short time master thereof. Thus farre the Lord Cardinall, whereunto my
      answere for satisfaction is; that degrading an Emperour from his Imperiall dignitie, and
      reducing a citie to reuolt against her Master, that a man at last may carry the piece
      himselfe, and make himselfe Lord thereof, are two seuerall actions of speciall difference. If
      the free- hold of the citie had beene conueied to some other by the Pope depriuing the
      Emperour, as proprietarie thereof, this example might haue challenged some credit at least in
      shew: but so to inuade the citie to his owne vse, and so to seize on the right and authority
      of another, what is it but open rebellion, and notorious ambition ? For it is farre from
      Ecclesiasticall censure, when the spirituall Pastor of soules forsooth, pulles the cloake of a
      poore sinner from his backe by violence, or cuts his purse, and thereby appropriates an other
      mans goods to his priuate vse. It is to be obserued withall, that when the Emperours were not
      of sufficient strength, and Popes had power to beard and to braue Emperours, then these Papall
      practises were first set on foot. This Emperour notwithstanding, turned head and peckt againe:
      his Lieutenant entred Rome, and <hi rend="italic">Gregorie</hi> 3. successor to this <hi
       rend="italic">Gregorie</hi> 2. was glad to honour the same Emperour with style and title of
      his Lord: witnesse two seuerall Epistles of the said <hi rend="italic">Gregorie</hi> 3.<note

     </p>
     <p>The L. Cardinall with no lesse abuse alleadgeth Pope <hi rend="italic">Zacharie</hi>, by
      whom the French, as he affirmeth, were absolued of the oath of allegiance, wherein they stood
      bound to <hi rend="italic">Childeric</hi> their King: And for this instance, he standeth vpon
      the testimonie of <hi rend="italic">Paulus Aemilius</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">du
      Tillet</hi>, a paire of late writers. But by <pb n="187"/> authors more neere that aage wherin
       <hi rend="italic">Childeric</hi> raigned, it is more trewly testified, that it was a free and
      voluntarie act of the French, onely asking the aduise of Pope <hi rend="italic">Zacharie</hi>,
      but requiring neither leaue nor absolution. <hi rend="italic">Ado</hi> Bishop of <hi
       rend="italic">Vienna,</hi> in his Chronicles hath it after this manner: <hi rend="italic">The
       French, following the Counsell of Embassadors, and of Pope</hi>, Zachary <hi rend="italic"
       >elected</hi> Pepin <hi rend="italic">their King, and established him in the Kingdome.
       Trithemius</hi> in his abridgement of Annals, thus: Childeric, <hi rend="italic">as one vnfit
       for gouernement, was turned out of his Kingdome, with common consent of the Estates and
       Peeres of the Realme, so aduised by Zacharie Pope of Rome, God- fridus</hi> of <hi
       rend="italic">Viterbe</hi> in the 17. part of his Chronicle; and <hi rend="italic"
       >Guauguin</hi> in the life of <hi rend="italic">Pepin,</hi> affirme the same. And was it not
      an easie matter to worke <hi rend="italic">Pepin</hi> by counsell to lay hold on the Kingdome,
      when he could not be hindered from fastening on the Crowne, and had already seizd it in
      effect, howsoeuer he had not yet attained to the name of King ? Moreouer, the rudenesse of
      that Nation, then wanting knowledge and Schooles either of divinitie, or of Academicall
      sciences, was a kind of spurre to make them runne for counsell ouer the mountaines: which
      neuerthelesse in a cause of such nature, they required not as necessary, but onely as decent
      and for fashion sake. The Pope also for his part was well appaied, by this meanes to draw <hi
       rend="italic">Pepin</hi> vnto his part; as one that stood in some neede of his aide against
      the Lombards; and the more, because his Lord the Emperour of Constantinople was then brought
      so low, that hee was not able to send him suf- ficient aide, for the defence of his
      territories against his enemies. But had <hi rend="italic">Zacha- rie</hi> (to deale plainely)
      not stood vpon the respect of his owne commodity, more then vpon the regard of Gods feare; he
      would neuer haue giuen counsell vnto the seruant, vnder the pretended colour of his Masters
      dull spirit, so to turne rebell against his Master. The Lawes prouide Gardians, or ouerseers,
      for such as are not well in their wits; they neuer depriue and spoile them of their estate:
      they punish crimes, but not diseases and infirmities by nature. Yea, in France it is a very
      auncient custome, when the King is troubled in his wits to establish a Regent, who for the
      time of the Kings disability, may beare the burden of the Kingdomes affaires. So was the
      practise of that State in the case of <hi rend="italic">Charles 6.</hi> when hee fell into a
      phrensie; whom the Pope notwithstanding his most grieuous and sharpe fits, neuer offered to
      degrade. And to be short, what reason, what equity will beare the children to be punished for
      the fathers debilitie ? Yet such punishment was laid vpon <hi rend="italic">Childerics</hi>
      whole race and house; who by this practise were all disinherited of the Kingdome. But shall
      wee now take some view, of the L. Cardinals excuse for this exemplarie fact ? The cause of <hi
       rend="italic">Childerics</hi><note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag. 25.</note> de- posing,
      (as the L. Cardinall saith) did neerely concerne and touch Religion: For <hi rend="italic"
       >Childerics</hi> imbecillity brought all France into danger, to suffer a most wofull
      shipwracke of Christian religion, vpon the barbarous and hostile inuasion of the Saracens.
      Admit now this reason had beene of iust weight and value, yet con- sideration should haue
      beene taken, whether some one or other of that Royall <pb n="188"/> stemme, and of the Kings
      owne successors neerest of blood, was not of better capacity to rule and mannage that mighty
      State. The feare of vncertaine and accidentall mischiefe, should not haue driuen them to flie
      vnto the certaine mis- chiefe of actuall and effectuall deposition. They should rather haue
      set before their eies the example of <hi rend="italic">Charles Martel</hi>, this <hi
       rend="italic">Pepins</hi> father; who in a farre more eminent danger, when the Saracens had
      already mastered, and subdued a great part of France, valiantly encountred, and withall
      defeated the Saracens; ruled the Kingdome vnder the title of <hi rend="italic">Steward</hi> of
      the Kings house, the principall Officer of the Crowne; without affecting or aspiring to the
      Throne for all that great step of aduantage, especially when the Saracens were quite broken,
      and no longer dreadfull to the French Nation. </p>
     <p>In our owne Scotland, the sway of the Kingdome was in the hand of <hi rend="italic"
       >Walles,</hi> during the time of <hi rend="italic">Bruse</hi> his imprisonment in England,
      who then was lawfull heire to the Crowne. This <hi rend="italic">Walles</hi> or <hi
       rend="italic">Vallas</hi> had the whole power of the King- dome at his becke and command. His
      Edicts and ordinances to this day stand in full force. By the deadly hatred of <hi
       rend="italic">Bruse</hi> his mortall enemie, it may be con- iectured, that he might haue bene
      prouoked and inflamed with desire to trusse the Kingdome in his tallants. And notwithstanding
      all these incitements, he neuer assumed or vsurped other title to himselfe, then of Gouernour
      or Adminis- tratour of the Kingdome. The reason: Hee had not beene brought vp in this new
      doctrine and late discipline, whereby the Church is endowed with power to giue and to take
      away Crownes. But now (as the L. Cardinall would beare the world in hand) the state of Kings
      is brought to a very dead lift. The Pope for- sooth must send his Physicians, to know by way
      of inspection or some other course of Art, whether the Kings braine be cract or sound: and in
      case there be found any debilitie of wit and reason in the King, then the Pope must remooue
      and translate the Crowne, from the weaker braine to a stronger: and for the acting of the
      stratageme, the name of Religion must be pretended. Ho, these Heretikes be- gin to crawle in
      the Kingdome: order must bee taken they bee not suffered by their multitudes and swarmes, like
      locusts or caterpillers to pester and poison the whole Realme. Or in a case of Matrimony,
      thus: Ho, marriage is a Sacra- ment: touch the Order of Matrimonie, and Religion is wounded.
      By this deuice not onely the Kings vices, but likewise his naturall diseases and infirmities
      are fetcht into the circle of Religion; and the L. Cardinall hath not done himselfe right, in
      restraining the Popes power to depose Kings, vnto the cases of Heresie, Apostasie, and
      persecution of the Church. </p>
     <p>In the next place followeth <hi rend="italic">Leo</hi> III. who by setting the Imperial
      Crowne vpon the head of <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi>, absolued all the Subiects in the West,
      of their obedience to the Greeke Emperours, if the L. of Perron might bee credited in this
      Example. But indeed it is crowded among the rest by a slie trick, and cleane contrary to the
      naked trewth of all histories: For it shall neuer be iustified by good historie, that so much
      as one single person or man (I say not one Countrey, or one people) <pb n="189"/> was then
      wrought or wonne by the Pope to change his copy and Lord, or from a subiect of the Greeke
      Emperours, to turne subiect vnto <hi rend="italic">Charlemaine</hi>. Let me see but one Towne
      that <hi rend="italic">Charlemaine</hi> recouered from the Greeke Emperours, by his right and
      title to his Empire in the West: No, the Greeke Emperours had taken their farewell of the West
      Empire long before: And therefore to nicke this vpon the tallie of Pope <hi rend="italic"
       >Leo</hi> his Acts, that he tooke away the West from the Greeke Emperour, it is euen as if
      one should say, that in this aage the Pope takes the Dukedome of <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi>
      from the French Kings, or the citie of Rome from the Em- perours of Germanie, because their
      Predecessours in former aages had beene right Lords and gouernours of them both. It is one of
      the Popes ordinary and solemne practises to take away, much after the maner of his gluing. For
      as he giueth what he hath not in his right and power to giue, or bestoweth vpon others what is
      already their owne; euen so he taketh away from Kings and Emperors the possessions which they
      haue not in present hold and possession. After this maner he takes the West from the Greeke
      Emperors, when they hold nothing in the West, and lay no claime to any citie or towne of the
      West Empire. And what shall wee call this way of depriuation, but spoiling a naked man of his
      garments, and killing a man already dead ? Trew it is the Imperiall Crowne was then set on <hi
       rend="italic">Charle- maines</hi> head by <hi rend="italic">Leo</hi> the Pope: did <hi
       rend="italic">Leo</hi> therefore giue him the Empire ? No more then a Bishop that crownes a
      King, at his Royall and solemne consecration, doeth giue him the Kingdome: For shall the Pope
      himselfe take the Popedome from the Bishop of <hi rend="italic">Ostia</hi> as of his gift,
      because the crowning of the Pope is an Office of long time peculiar to the <hi rend="italic"
       >Ostian</hi> Bishop ? It was the custome of Emperours, to be crowned Kings of Italy by the
      hands of the Archbishop of <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi>: did he therefore giue the Kingdome of
      Italy to the said Emperours ? And to returne vnto <hi rend="italic">Charlemaine</hi>; If the
      Pope had conueyed the Empire to him by free and gracious donation, the Pope doubtlesse in the
      solemnitie of his coronation, would neuer haue perfourmed vnto his owne creature, an Emperour
      of his owne making the dueties of adoration, as <hi rend="italic">Ado</hi> that liued in the
      same aage, hath left it on record: <hi rend="italic">After the solemne prayses ended</hi>

      Suppose Pope <hi rend="italic">Leo</hi> dispossessed the Greeke Emperours of the West Empire:
      What was the cause? what infamous acte had they done? what prophane and irreli- gious crime
      had they committed ? <hi rend="italic">Nicephorus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Irene</hi>, who
      reigned in the Greeke Empire in <hi rend="italic">Charlemaines</hi> time, were not reputed by
      the Pope, or taken for Here- tikes. How then ? The L. Cardinall helpeth at a pinch, and
      putteth vs in minde, that <hi rend="italic">Constantine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Leo</hi>,
      predecessours to the said Emperours, had beene poysoned with Heresie, and stained with
      persecution. Here then behold an Or- thodoxe Prince deposed: For what cause ? for Heresie
      forsooth, not in himselfe, but in some of his Predecessors long before. An admirable case: For
      I am of a contrary minde, that he was worthy of double honour, in restoring and setting vp the
      trewth againe, which vnder his predecessors had endured oppression, and suffered persecution.
      Doubtlesse Pope <hi rend="italic">Siluester</hi> was greatly ouerseene, and played not well
      the Pope, when hee winked at <hi rend="italic">Constantine</hi> the Great, and cast him not
      downe from his Imperiall Throne, for the strange infidelitie and Pagan- isme of <hi
       rend="italic">Diocletian, of Maximian</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Maxentius</hi>, whom <hi

      brought forth turbulent and stirring spirits, men altogether forgetfull of respect and
      obseruance towards their Kings, especially when the world finds them shallow and simple-
      witted, like vnto this Prince ? But in this example, where is there so much as one word of the
      Pope, or the deposing of Kings ? </p>

      of excommunication and deposition, against the Emperour <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> IIII,
      after he had enterprised this act without all precedent example: after he had filled all
      Europe with blood: this Pope, I say, sunke downe vnder the weight of his affaires, and died as

      and alleadge the example of such a man, who by attempting an act which neuer any man had the

      their thrones by Emperours and Kings. </p>

      their sacred Maiesties, and of executing their commaunds with entire obedi- ence; payed to the

      tossed and turmoiled with lamentable warres, which plagued the world, and the Empire by name
      with intolerable troubles and mischiefes. For after the said <hi rend="italic">Gregorian</hi>
      warres, the Empire fell from bad to worse, and so went on to decay, till Emperours at last
      were driuen to beg, and receiue the Imperiall Crowne of the Pope. </p>
     <p>The Kingdome of <hi rend="italic">France</hi> met not with so rude entreatie, but was dealt
      withall by courses of a milder temper. <hi rend="italic">Gregorie</hi> 4. about the yeere of
      the Lord, 832, was the first Pope that perswaded himselfe to vse the censure of
      Excommunication against a King of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>. This Pope hauing a hand in
      the troublesome factions of the Realme, was nothing backward to side with the sonnes of <hi
       rend="italic">Lewis</hi> surnamed the Courteous, by wicked conspiracie entring into a

      Gregorie <hi rend="italic">comming into</hi> France, <hi rend="italic">ioyned himselfe to the

       >Benedicts</hi> Order, doe testifie, that all the Bishops of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>
      fell vpon this resolution; by no means to rest in the Popes pleasure, or to giue any place
      vnto his designe: and contrariwise, <hi rend="italic">In case the Pope should proceed to
       Excommunication of their King, hee should returne out of</hi> France <hi rend="italic"
       >to</hi> Rome <hi rend="italic">an ex- communicate person himselfe</hi>. The Chronicle of S.
       <hi rend="italic">Denis</hi> hath words in this forme: <hi rend="italic">The Lord

       any other purpose, but onely to excommunicate the King and his Bishops, if they would bee in
       any sort opposite vnto the sonnes of</hi> Lewis, <hi rend="italic">or disobedient vnto the
       will and pleasure of his Holinesse: The Prelates enformed heereof, made answere, that in this
       case they would neuer yeeld obedience to the Excommiuncation of the said Bishops; because it
       was contrary to the authoritie and aduise of the ancient Canons.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>After these times, Pope <hi rend="italic">Nicolas I</hi>. depriued King <hi rend="italic"
       >Lotharius</hi> of Communion (for in those times not a word of deposing) to make him
      repudiate or quit <hi rend="italic">Val- drada</hi>, and to resume or take againe <hi

      point, are to bee found in the writing of <hi rend="italic">Hincma- rus</hi>, Archibishop of
       <hi rend="italic">Reims</hi>, and are of this purport; that in the iudgement of men both
      learned and wise, it is an ouerruled case, that as the King whatsoeuer hee shall doe, ought
      not by his owne Bishops to be excommunicated, euen so no for- reine Bishop hath power to sit
      for his Iudge: because the King is to be subject onely vnto God, and his Imperiall authoritie,
      who alone had the all-sufficient <pb n="194"/> power to settle him in his Kingdome. Moreouer,
      the Clergie addressed letters of answere vnto the same Pope, full of stinging and bitter
      termes, with speaches of great scorne and contempt, as they are set downe by <hi rend="italic"
       >Auentine</hi>,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Annal. Boio. lib. 4. </note> in his Annals
      of <hi rend="italic">Bauaria</hi>, not forbearing to call him <hi rend="italic">thiefe, wolfe,
       and tyrant.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>When Pope <hi rend="italic">Hadrian</hi> tooke vpon him like a Lord, to command <hi
       rend="italic">Charles</hi> the Bald vpon paine of interdiction, that hee should suffer the
      Kingdome of <hi rend="italic">Lotharius</hi> to bee fully and entirely conueyed and conferred
      vpon <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> his sonne; the same <hi rend="italic">Hincmarus</hi>, a man
      of great authoritie and estimation in that aage, sent his letters conteining sundry
      remonstrances touching that subject: Among other matters thus he writeth, <hi rend="italic"
       >The Ecclesiastics and Seculars of the Kingdome assembled at</hi> Reims, <hi rend="italic"
       >haue affirmed and now doe affirme by way of reproach, vpbraiding, and ex- probation, that
       neuer was the like Mandate sent before from the See of</hi> Rome <hi rend="italic">to any of
       our predecessours</hi>. And a little after: <hi rend="italic">The chiefe Bishops of the
       Apostolike See, or any other Bishops of the greatest authoritie and holinesse, neuer withdrew
       them- selues from the presence, from the reuerend salutation, or from the conference of
       Emperours and Kings, whether Heretikes, or Schismatikes and Tyrants: as</hi> Con- stantius
       <hi rend="italic">the Arrian</hi>, Iulianus <hi rend="italic">the Apostata, and</hi> Maximus
       <hi rend="italic">the Tyrant</hi>. And yet a little after; <hi rend="italic">Wherefore if the
       Apostolike Lord bee minded to seeke peace, let him seeke it so, that he stirre no brawles,
       and breed no quarrels: For we are no such babes to beleeue, that we can or euer shall attaine
       to Gods Kingdome, unlesse wee receiue him for our King in earth, whom God himself
       recommendeth to vs from heauen</hi>. It is added by <hi rend="italic">Hincmarus</hi> in the
      same place, that by the said Bishops and Lords Tem- porall, such threatning words were blowen
      forth, as hee is afraid once to speake and vtter. As for the King himselfe, what reckoning hee
      made of the Popes mandates, it appeareth by the Kings owne letters addressed to Pope <hi
       rend="italic">Hadrianus,</hi> as we may reade euery where in the Epistles of <hi
       rend="italic">Hincmarus</hi>. For there, after King <hi rend="italic">Charles</hi> hath taxed
      and challenged the Pope of pride, and hit him in the teeth with a spirit of vsurpation, hee
      breaketh out into these words: <hi rend="italic">What Hell hath cast vp this law so crosse and
       preposterous ? what infernal gulph hath disgorged this law out of the darkest and obscurest
       dennes ? a law quite contrary, and altogether repugnant vnto the beaten way shewed vs in the
       holy Scriptures, &amp;c</hi>. Yea, he flatly and peremptorily forbids the Pope, except he
      meane or desire to be recompensed with dishonour and contempt, to send any more the like
      Mandates, either to himselfe, or to his Bishops. </p>
     <p>Vnder the reigne of <hi rend="italic">Hugo Capetus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Robert</hi>
      his sonne, a Councell now extant in all mens hands, was held and celebrated at <hi
       rend="italic">Reims</hi> by the Kings authoritie. There <hi rend="italic">Arnulphus</hi>
      Bishop of <hi rend="italic">Orleans</hi>, then Prolocutor and Speaker of the Councel, calls
      the Pope Antichrist, and lets not also to paint him forth like a monster: as well for the
      deformed and vgly vices of that vnholy See, which then were in their exaltation, as also
      because the Pope then wonne with presents, and namely with certaine goodly horses, then
      presented to his Holinesse, tooke part against <pb n="195"/> the King, with <hi rend="italic"
       >Arnulphus</hi> Bishop of <hi rend="italic">Reims</hi>, then dispossessed of his Pastorall
      charge. </p>
     <p>When <hi rend="italic">Philip I</hi>. had repudiated his wife <hi rend="italic">Bertha</hi>,
      daughter to the Earle of <hi rend="italic">Hol- land</hi>; and in her place had also taken to
      wife <hi rend="italic">Bertrade</hi> the wife of <hi rend="italic">Fulco</hi> Earle of <hi
       rend="italic">Aniou</hi> yet being aliue; hee was excommunicated, and his Kingdome
      interdicted by <hi rend="italic">Vrbanus</hi> then Pope, (though he was then bearded with an
      Antipope) as the L. Cardinal here giueth vs to vnderstand. But his Lordship hath skipt ouer
      two principall points recorded in the historie. The first is, that <hi rend="italic"
       >Philip</hi>, was not de- posed by the Pope: whereupon it is to be inferred, that in this
      passage there is nothing materiall to make for the Popes power against a Kings Throne and
      Scep- ter. The other point is, that by the censures of the Pope, the course of obedience due
      to the King before was not interrupted, nor the King disauowed, refused, or disclaimed: but on
      the contrary, that <hi rend="italic">Iuo</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Charytres</hi> taking Pope
       <hi rend="italic">Vrbanus</hi> part, was punished for his presumption, dispoyled of his
      estate, and kept in prison: whereof he makes complaint himselfe in his 19. and 20. Epistles.
      The L. Cardinall besides, in my vnderstanding for his Masters honour, should haue made no
      words of interdicting the whole Kingdome. For when the Pope, to giue a King chastise- ment,
      doeth interdict his Kingdome, hee makes the people to beare the punish- ment of the Kings
      offence: For during the time of interdiction, the Church doores through the whole Kingdome are
      kept continually shut and lockt vp: publike service is intermitted in all places: bels euery
      where silent: Sacraments not ad- ministred to the people: bodies of the dead so prostituted
      and abandoned, that none dares burie the said bodies in holy ground. More, it is beleeued,
      that a man dying vnder the curse of the interdict (without some speciall indulgence or priui-
      ledge) is for euer damned and adiudged to eternall punishments, as one that dyeth out of the
      communion of the Church. Put case then the interdict holdeth and continueth for many yeares
      together; alas, how many millions of poore soules are damned, and goe to hell for an others
      offence ? For what can, or what may the faltlesse and innocent people doe withall, if the King
      will repudiate his wife, and she yet liuing, ioyne himselfe in matrimonie to an other ? </p>
     <p>The Lord Cardinall after <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi> the I. produceth <hi rend="italic"
       >Philippus Augustus</hi>,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Examp. 12. </note> who hauing
      renounced his wife <hi rend="italic">Ingeberga</hi> daughter to the King of <hi rend="italic"
       >Denmarke</hi>, and marrying with <hi rend="italic">Agnes</hi> daughter to the Duke of <hi
       rend="italic">Morauia</hi>, was by Pope Innocent the third interdicted himselfe and his whole
      Kingdome. But his Lordshippe was not pleased to insert withall, what is auerred in the
      Chronicle of Saint <hi rend="italic">Denis:</hi> that Pope <hi rend="italic">Caelestinus</hi>
      3. sent forth two Legats at once vpon this errand: <note anchored="true" place="foot">Bochel.
       pag. 320.</note>
      <hi rend="italic">Who being come into the assemblie and generall Council of all the French
       Prelats, became like dumbe dogs that can not barke, so as they could not bring the seruice
       which they had undertaken to any good passe, because they stood in a bodily feare of their
       owne hydes. Not long after, the Cardinall of Capua was in the like taking: For hee durst nor
       bring the Realme within the limits of the interdict, before hee was got out of the</hi>
      <pb n="196"/>
      <hi rend="italic">limits of the Kingdome. The King herewith incensed, thrust all the Prelates
       that had giuen consent vnto these proceedings out of their Sees, confiscated their goods,
       &amp;c.</hi> To the same effect is that which wee reade in <hi rend="italic">Matthew
       Paris</hi>. After the Pope had giuen his Maiestie to vnderstand by the Cardinal of <hi
       rend="italic">Anagnia</hi>, that his kingdome should be interdicted, vnlesse he would be
      reconciled to the King of England; the King returned the Pope this answere, that he was not in
      any sort afraid of the Popes sentence, for as much as it could not be grounded vpon any
      equitie of the cause: and added withall, <hi rend="italic">that it did no way appertaine vnto
       the Church of Rome to sentence Kings, especially the King of France</hi>. And this was done,
      saith <hi rend="italic">Iohannes Tilius</hi> Register in Court of Parliament of Paris, <hi
       rend="italic">by the counsell of the French Barons.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>Most notable is the example of <hi rend="italic">Philip the faire</hi>, and hits the bird in
      the right eye. In the yeere 1032. the Pope dispatched the Archbishop of <hi rend="italic"
       >Narbona</hi> with <hi rend="italic">mandates</hi> into France, commanding the King to
      release the Bishop of <hi rend="italic">Apamia</hi> then detained in prison, for contumelious
      words tending to the Kings defamation, and spoken to the Kings owne head. In very deed this
      Pope had conceiued a secret grudge, and no light displeasure against King <hi rend="italic"
       >Philip</hi> before: namely, be- cause the King had taken vpon him the collation of
      Benefices, and other Eccle- siastical dignities. Vpon which occasion the Pope sent letters to
      the King of this tenour and style: <hi rend="italic">Feare God, and keepe his Commandements:
       Wee would haue thee know, that in Spirituall and Temporall causes thou art subiect vnto our
       selfe: that collating of Benefices and Prebends, doeth not in any sort appertaine to thy
       office and place: that, in case as keeper of the Spiritualties, thou haue the custodie of
       Benefices and Prebends in thy hand when they become voyd, thou shalt by sequestra- tion
       reserue the fruits of the same, to the vse and benefit of the next Incumbents and successors:
       and in case thou hast heretofore collated any, we ordaine the said colla- tions to be meerely
       void: and so farre as herein thou hast proceeded to the fact, we reuoke the said collations.
       We hold them for hereticks whosoeuer are not of this beliefe</hi>. A Legate comes to Paris,
      and brings these brauing letters: By some of the Kings faithfull seruants they are violently
      snatched and pulled out of the Legates hands: by the Earle of Artois they are cast into the
      fire. The good King answeres the Pope, and payes him in as good coyne as he had sent. <hi
       rend="italic">Philip by the grace of God King of the French, to</hi> Boniface <hi
       rend="italic">calling and bearing himselfe the Soueraigne Bishop, little greeting or none at
       all. May thy exceeding sottishnesse vnderstand, that in Temporall causes we are not subiect
       vnto any mortall and earthly creature: that collating of Benefices and Prebends, by Regall
       right appertaineth to our office and place: that appropriating their fruits when they become
       void, belongeth to our selfe alone during their vacancie: that all collations by vs
       heretofore made, or to bee made hereafter, shall stand in force: that in the validitie and
       vertue of the said collations, wee will euer couragiously defend and maintaine, all
       Incumbents and possessors of Benefices and Prebends so by vs collated. We hold them all for
       sots and senselesse, whosoeuer are not of this beliefe</hi>. The Pope incensed herewith,
      excom- <pb n="197"/> municates the King: but no man dares publish that censure, or become
      bearer thereof. The King notwithstanding the said proceedings of the Pope, assembles his
      Prelates, Barons, and Knights at Paris: askes the whole assembly, of whom they hold their
      Fees, with al other the Temporalties of the Church. They make answere with one voice, that in
      the said matters they disclaime the Pope, and know none other Lord beside his Maiestie. Meane
      while the Pope worketh with Germainie and the Low Countreis, to stirre them vp against France.
      But <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi> sendeth <hi rend="italic">William</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
       >Nogaret</hi> into Italy. <hi rend="italic">William</hi> by the direction and aide of <hi
       rend="italic">Sciarra Columnensis</hi>, takes the Pope at <hi rend="italic">Anagnia</hi>,
      mounts him vpon a leane ill- fauoured iade, caries him prisoner to Rome; where ouercome with
      choller, anguish and great indignation, he takes his last leaue of the Popedome and his life.
      All this notwithstanding, the King presently after, from the successours of <hi rend="italic"
       >Boniface</hi> receiues very ample and gratious Bulls, in which the memorie of all the former
      passages and actions is vtterly abolished. Witnesse the Epistle of <hi rend="italic">Clement
       5.</hi><note anchored="true" place="foot">Extrauag. Meruit. </note> wherein this King is
      honoured with praises, for a pious and religious Prince, and his Kingdome is restored to the
      former estate. In that aage the French Nobilitie caried other maner of spirits, then the
      moderne and present Nobilitie doe: I meane those by whom the L. Cardinal was applauded and
      assisted in his Oration. Yea, in those former times the Prelates of the Realme stood better
      affected towards their King, then the L. Cardinal himselfe now standeth: who could finde none
      other way to daily with, and to shift off this pregnant example, but by plaine glosing, that
      heresie and Apostasie was no ground of that question, or subiect of that controuersie. Wherein
      hee not onely condemnes the Pope, as one that proceeded against <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi>
      without a iust cause &amp; good ground, but likewise giues the Pope the Lie, who in his goodly
      letters but a little aboue recited, hath enrowled <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi>, in the list
      of heretiques. Hee saith moreouer, that indeed the knot of the question was touching the Popes
      pretence, in challenging to himselfe the temporall Soueraigntie of France, that is to say, in
      qualifying himselfe King of France: But indeed and indeed no such matter to be found. His
      whole pre- tence was the collating of Benefices, and to pearch aboue the King, to crow ouer
      his Crowne in Temporall causes. At which pretence his Holinesse yet aimeth, still attributing
      and challenging to himselfe plenarie power to depose the King. Now if the L. Cardinal shall
      yet proceed to cauill, that <hi rend="italic">Boniface</hi> the eighth was taken by the French
      for an vsurper, and no lawfull Pope, but for one that crept into the Papacie by fraud and
      symonie; he must be pleased to set downe positiuely who was Pope, seeing that <hi
       rend="italic">Boniface</hi> then sate not in the Papall chaire. To conclude, If hee that
      creepeth and stealeth into the Papacie by symonie, by canuases or labouring of suffrages vnder
      hand, or by bribery, be not lawfull Pope; I dare be bold to professe, there will hardly be
      found two lawfull Popes in the three last aages. <pb n="198"/>

       Charles du Moulin contra paruas Datas, wherein he reporteth a notable Decree of the Court

      gainefull exactions and extorsions of the Popes Court, by which the Realme of France had bene
      exhausted of their treasure, sent an excommunicatorie Bull into France, against <hi
       rend="italic">Charles</hi> the King, and all his Princes. The Vnuiersitie of Paris made
      request or motion that his Bull might be mangled, and Pope <hi rend="italic">Benedict</hi>
      himselfe, by some called <hi rend="italic">Petrus de Luna</hi>, might be declared <hi
       rend="italic">heretike, schismatike, and perturber of the peace</hi>. The said Bull<note
       anchored="true" place="foot">Theodoric. Niemens in nemore vnion. Tract. 6. &amp; somnium
       viridarij.</note> was mangled and rent in pieces, according to the petition of the
      Vniuersitie, by Decree of Court vpon the tenth of Iune, 1408. Tenne dayes after, the Court
      rising at eleuen in the morning, two Bul-bearers of the said excommunicatorie censure
      vnderwent ignominious punishment vpon the Palace or great Hal staires. From thence were led to
      the <hi rend="italic">Louure</hi> in such maner as they had bene brought from thence before:
      drawne in two tumbrels, clad in coates of painted linnen, wore paper-mytres on their heads,
      were proclaimed with sound of Trumpet, and euery where disgraced with publike derision: So
      litle reckoning was made of the Popes thundering canons in those dayes. And what would they
      haue done, if the said Buls had imported sentence of deposition against King <hi rend="italic"
       >Charles?</hi>
     </p>
     <p>The French Church assembled at <hi rend="italic">Tours</hi> in the yeere 1510. decreed that
       <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> XII. might with safe conscience contemne <hi rend="italic">the
       abusiue Bulls, and vniust censures of Pope</hi> Iulius <hi rend="italic">the</hi> II. and by
      armes might withstand the Popes vsurpations, in case hee should proceed to excommunicate or
      depose the King. More, by a Councill holden at <hi rend="italic">Pisa</hi>, this <hi
       rend="italic">Lewis</hi> declared the Pope to bee fallen from the Pope- dome, and coyned
      crownes with a stampe of this inscription, <hi rend="italic">I will destroy the name of
       Babylon</hi>. To this the L. of <hi rend="italic">Perron</hi> makes answere, that all this
      was done by the French, as acknowledging these iars to haue sprung not from the fountaine of
      Religion, but from passion of state. Wherein he condemneth Pope <hi rend="italic">Iulius</hi>,
      for gluing so great scope vnto his publike censures, as to serue his ambition, and not rather
      to aduance Religion. He secretly teacheth vs besides, that when the Pope vndertakes to depose
      the King of France, then the French are to sit as Iudges concerning the lawfulnesse or
      vnlawfulnesse of the cause; and in case they shall finde the cause to be vnlawfull, then to
      disanull his iudgements, and to scoffe at his thunderbolts. <hi rend="italic">Iohn
       d'Albret</hi> King of Nauarre, whose Realme was giuen by the foresaid Pope to <hi
       rend="italic">Ferdinand</hi> King of Arragon, was also wrapped and entangled with strict
      bands of deposition. Now if the French had bene touched with no better feeling of affection to
      their King, then the subiects of Nauarre were to the Nauarrois; doubtlesse France had sought a
      new Lord, by vertue of the Popes (as the L. Car- dinall himselfe doeth acknowledge and
      confesse) vniust sentence. But behold, to make the said sentence against <hi rend="italic"
       >Iohn d'Albret</hi> seeme the lesse contrary to equitie, <pb n="199"/> the L. Cardinall
      pretends, the Popes donation was not indeed the principall cause,<note anchored="true"
       place="foot">Pag. 51.</note> howsoeuer <hi rend="italic">Ferdinand</hi> himselfe made it his
      pretence. But his Lo. giues this for the principall cause: that Iohn <hi rend="italic"
       >d'Albret</hi> had quitted his alliance made with con- dition; that in case the Kings of
      Nauarre should infringe the said alliance, and breake the league, then the kingdome of Nauarre
      should returne to the Crowne of Arragon. This condition, betweene Kings neuer made, and
      without all shew of probabilitie, serueth to none other purpose from the Cardinals mouth, but
      onely to insinuate and worke a perswasion in his King, that he hath no right nor lawfull
      pretension to the Crowne of Nauarre: and whatsoeuer hee now holdeth in the said kingdome of
      Nauarre, is none of his owne, but by vsurpation and vn- lawfull possession. Thus his Lordship
      French-borne, makes himselfe an Aduo- cate for the Spanish King, against his owne King, and
      King of the French: who shalbe faine, as hee ought (if this Aduocats plea may take place) to
      draw his title and style of King of Nauarre out of his Royall titles, and to acknowledge that
      all the great endeuours of his predecessors to recouer the said Kingdome, were dis- honourable
      and vniust. Is it possible, that in the very heart and head Citie of France, a spirit and
      tongue so licentious can be brooked ? What, shall so great blasphemie (as it were) of the
      Kings freehold, bee powred foorth in so honourable an assembly, without punishment or fine ?
      What, without any contradiction for the Kings right, and on the Kings behalfe ? I may perhaps
      confesse the indignitie might bee the better borne, and the pretence alledged might passe for
      a poore excuse, if it serued his purpose neuer so little. For how doeth all this touch or come
      neere the question ? in which the Popes vsurpation in the deposing of Kings, and the
      resolution of the French in resisting this tyrannicall practise, is the proper issue of the
      cause: both which points are neuer a whit more of the lesse consequence and inportance,
      howsoeuer <hi rend="italic">Ferdinand</hi> in his owne iustification stood vpon the foresaid
      pretence. Thus much is confessed, and wee aske no more: Pope <hi rend="italic">Iulius</hi>
      tooke the Kingdome from the one, and gaue it vnto the other: the French thereupon resisted the
      Pope, and declared him to be fallen from the Papacie. </p>
     <p>This noble spirit and courage of the French, in maintayning the dignitie and honour of their
      Kings Crownes, bred those ancient customes, which in the se- quence of many aages haue bene
      obserued and kept in vse. This for one: That no Legate of the Pope, nor any of his rescripts
      nor <hi rend="italic">mandates</hi>,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag. 26. Nisi de
       consensu Regis Christianissimi.</note> are admitted and receiued in France, <hi rend="italic"
       >without licence from the King</hi>: and vnlesse the Legate impart his faculties to the Kings
      Atturney Generall, to be perused and verified in Court of Parliament: where they are to be
      tyed by certaine modifications and restrictions, vnto such points as are not derogatorie from
      the Kings right, from the liberties of the Church, and from the ordinances of the Kingdome.
      When Cardinal <hi rend="italic">Balua</hi>,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
       >Bochellus.</note> contrary to this ancient forme, entred France in the yeere 1484. and there
       <pb n="200"/> without leaue of the King did execute the office, &amp; speed certaine Acts of
      the Popes Legate; the Court vpon motion made by the Kings Atturney Generall, decreed a
      Commission, to be informed against him by two Councellors of the the said Court, and inhibited
      his further proceeding to vse any facultie or power of the Popes Legate, vpon paine of beeing
      proclamied rebell. </p>
     <p>In the yeere 1561. <hi rend="italic">Iohannes Tanquerellus</hi> Batchelour in Diuinitie, by

      neither of Heresie nor of Infidelitie: but I answere, The said proposition treateth of both,
      forasmuch as it maketh mention of disobedience to the Pope. For I suppose hee will not denie,
      that whosoeuer shall stand out in Heresie, contrary to the Popes monitorie proceedings, he
      shal shew but poore and simple obedience to the Pope. Moreouer, the case is cleare by the
      former examples, that no Pope will suffer his power to cast downe Kings, to be restrained vnto
      the cause of Heresie and Infidelitie. </p>
     <p>In the heate of the last warres, raised by that holy-prophane League, admoni- tory Bulls
      were sent by Pope <hi rend="italic">Gregorie</hi> 14. from <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, Anno
      1591. By these Bulls King <hi rend="italic">Henrie</hi> 4. as an Heretike and relapse, was
      declared incapable of the Crowne of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, and his Kingdome was
      exposed to hauocke and spoile. The Court of Parliament being assembled at <hi rend="italic"
       >Tours</hi> the 5. of August, decreed the said admoni- torie Bulls to bee cancelled, torne in
      pieces, and cast into a great fire by the hand of the publike executioner. The Arrest it selfe
      or Decree is of this tenour: <hi rend="italic">The Court duely pondering and approoying the
       concluding and unanswerable reasons of Kings Attorney Generall, hath declared, and by these
       present doeth declare, the ad- monitorie Bulls giuen at</hi> Rome <hi rend="italic">the 1. of
       March 1591. to be of no validitie, abusiue, seditious, damnable, full of impietie and
       impostures, contrary to the holy decrees, rights, franchises, and liberties of the French
       Church: doeth ordeine the Copies of</hi> the <hi rend="italic">said Bulls, sealed with the
       seale of</hi> Marsilius Landrianus, <hi rend="italic">and signed</hi> Septilius Lamprius, <hi
       rend="italic">to bee rent in pieces by the publike executioner, and by him to be burnt in a
       great fire to be made for such purpose, before the great gates of the common Hall or Palace,
       &amp;c</hi>. Then, euen then the L. of <hi rend="italic">Perron</hi> was firme for the better
      part, and stood for his King against <hi rend="italic">Gregorie</hi> the Pope, notwithstanding
      the crime of heresie pretended against <hi rend="italic">Henrie</hi> his Lord. </p>
     <p>All the former examples by vs alledged, are drawen out of the times after Schooles of
      Diuinitie were established in <hi rend="italic">France</hi>: For I thought good to bound my
       <pb n="201"/> selfe within those dooles and limits of time, which the L. Cardinal himselfe
      hath set. Who goeth not sincerely to worke and in good earnest, where he telleth vs there be
      three instances (as if wee had no more) obiected against Papall power, to remooue Kings out of
      their chaires of State: by name, <hi rend="italic">the example of</hi> Philip <hi
       rend="italic">the Faire,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Page 47. </note> of</hi> Lewis
      XII. <hi rend="italic">and of</hi> Tanquerellus: For in very trewth all the former examples by

      to conceale them all for feare of hurting his cause. </p>
     <p>Nay, <hi rend="italic">France</hi> euen in the dayes of her sorest seruitude, was neuer
      vnfurnished of great Diuines, by whom this vsurped power of the Pope, ouer the Temporalties
      and Crownes of Kings, hath beene vtterly misliked and condemned. <hi rend="italic">Robert</hi>
      Earle of <hi rend="italic">Flanders</hi> was commanded by Pope <hi rend="italic">Paschal</hi>
      <note anchored="true" place="foot">Bibliotheca Patrum. Tom. 3.</note>. to persecute with fire
      and sword the Clergie of <hi rend="italic">Liege</hi>, who then adhered and stood to the cause
      of the Emperour <hi rend="italic">Henrie</hi> 4. whom the Pope had ignominiously deposed. <hi
       rend="italic">Robert</hi> by the Popes order and command, was to handle the Clergie of <hi
       rend="italic">Liege</hi> in like sort as before hee had serued the Clergie of <hi
       rend="italic">Cambray</hi>, who by the said Earle had beene cruelly stript both of goods and
      life: The Pope promised the said Earle and his army pardon of their sinnes for the said
      execution. The Clergie of <hi rend="italic">Liege</hi> addressed answere to the Pope at large:
      They cried out vpon the Church of <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, and called her <hi
       rend="italic">Babylon</hi>: Told the Pope home, that God had commanded to giue vnto <hi
       rend="italic">Caesar</hi> that which is <hi rend="italic">Caesars</hi>: that euery soule must
      bee subiect vnto the superiour powers: that no man is exempted out of this precept: and that
      euery oath of alleagiance is to be kept inuiolable; yea, that hereof they themselues are not
      ignorant, in as much as they by a new Schisme, and new traditions, making a separation and
      rent of the Priesthood from the Kingdome, doe promise to absolue of periurie, such as haue
      perfidiously forsworne themselues against their King. And whereas by way of despight and in
      opprobrious maner, they were excom- municated by the Pope, they gaue his Holinesse to
      vnderstand, that <hi rend="italic">Dauids heart had vttered a good matter, but</hi> Paschals
       <hi rend="italic">heart had spewed vp sordid and railing words, like old bawdes and spinsters
       or websters of linnen, when they scold and brawle one with another</hi>. Finally, they
      reiected his Papal excommunication, as a sentence giuen without discretion. This was the voyce
      and free speach of that Clergie, in the life time of their noble Emperour: But after hee was
      thrust out of the Em- pire by the rebellion of his owne sonne, instigated and stirred vp
      thereunto by the Popes perswasion and practise, and was brought vnto a miserable death; it is
      no matter of wonder, that for the safegard of their life, the said Clergie were driuen to sue
      vnto the Pope for their pardon. <hi rend="italic">Hildebert</hi>2 Bishop of <hi rend="italic"

       vpon the face of the earth</hi>. Now here need no great sharpenesse of wit for the searching

       good speach and other meanes, like a skilfull and wise Physitian: Yea nothing would be more
       cruel or more voyd of reason, then to seeke to stop the strong and violent streame of
       tyrannie by sedition</hi>. These words, me thinke, doe make very strongly and expresly
      against butchering euen of Tyrannical Kings. And whereas a little after the said passage, he
      teacheth to expell Tyrannie, he hath not a word of expelling the Tyrant, but onely of breaking
      and shaking off the yoke of Tyrannie. Yet for all that, he would not haue the remedies for the
      repressing of Tyrannie, to be fetcht from the Pope, who presumeth to degrade Kings, but from
       <hi rend="italic">Philosophers, Lawyers, Diuines, and personages of good conuersation</hi>.
      It appeareth now by all that hath bin said before, that whereas <hi rend="italic">Gerson</hi>
      in the 7. Considerat. <hi rend="italic">against Flatterers</hi>, doeth affirme: <hi
       rend="italic">Whensoeuer the Prince doeth manifestly pursue and prosecute his naturall
       subiects, and shew himselfe obstinately bent with notorious iniustice, to vexe them of set
       purpose, and with full consent, so farre as to the fact; then this rule and law of Nature
       doeth take place, It is lawfull to resist and repell force by force; and the sentence of</hi>
      Seneca, <hi rend="italic">There is no sacrifice more acceptable to God, then a tyrant offered
       in sacrifice</hi>; the words, <hi rend="italic">doeth take place</hi>, are so to be
      vnderstood, as he speaketh in another passage, to wit, with or amongst seditious persons. Or
      else the words, <hi rend="italic">doeth take place</hi>, doe onely signifie, <hi rend="italic"
       >is put in practise.</hi> And so <hi rend="italic">Gerson</hi> there speaketh not as out of
      his owne iudgement. </p>
     <p>His Lordship also should not haue balked and left out <hi rend="italic">Sigebertus</hi>, who
      with more reason might haue passed for French, then <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">Occam</hi>, whom hee putteth vpon vs for French. <hi rend="italic"
       >Sigebertus</hi> in his Chronicle vpon the yeere 1088. speaking of the Emperours deposing by
      the Pope, hath words of this tenour: <hi rend="italic">This Heresie was not crept out of the
       shell in those dayes, that his Priests, who hath said to the King</hi> Apostata, <hi
       rend="italic">and maketh an hypocrite to rule for the sinnes of the people, should teach the
       people they owe no subiection vnto wicked Kings, nor any alleagiance, notwithstanding they
       haue taken the oath of alleagiance.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>Now after the L. Cardinall hath coursed in this maner through the histories of the last
      aages (which in case they all made for his purpose, doe lacke the weight of authority) in
      stead of searching the will of God in the sacred Oracles of his word and standing vpon
      examples of the ancient Church; at last, leauing the troupe of his owne allegations, he
      betakes himselfe to the sharpening and rebating of the points of his aduersaries weapons. </p>
     <p>For the purpose, he brings in his aduersaries, the champions of Kings Crownes, &amp; makes
      them to speake out of his own mouth (for his Lordship saith it will be <pb n="207"/> obiected)
      after this manner:<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag. 52. &amp; sequentibus. </note>
      <hi rend="italic">It may come to passe, that Popes either caried with passion, or misled by
       sinister information, may without iust cause fasten vpon Kings the imputation of heresie or
       apostasie</hi>. Then for King-deposers he frames this answere: <hi rend="italic">That by
       heresie they vnderstand notorious heresie, and formerly condemned by sentence of the Church.
       Moreouer, in case the Pope hath erred in the fact, it is the Clergies part adhering to their
       King, to make remonstrances vnto the Pope, and to require the cause may be referred to the
       iudgement of afull Councel, the French Church then and there being present</hi>. Now in this
      answere, the L. Cardinall is of another mind then <hi rend="italic">Bellarmine</hi> his
      brother Cardinall: For hee goes thus farre,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Aduers.
       Barclaium.</note> That a Prince condemned by vniust sentence of the Pope, ought neuerthelesse
      to quit his Kingdome, and that his Pastors vniust sentence shall not redound to his detriment;
      prouided that hee giue way to the said sentence, and shew himselfe not refractarie, but stay
      the time in patience, vntil the holy Father shall renounce his error, and reuoke his foresaid
      vniust sentence. In which case these two material points are to be presupposed: The one, That
      he who now hath seized the kingdome of the Prince displaced, wil forthwith (if the Pope shall
      sollicit and intercede) returne the Kingdome to the hand of the late possessor: The other,
      That in the <hi rend="italic">interim</hi> the Prince vniustly deposed, shall not need to
      feare the bloody murderers mercilesse blade and weapon. But on the other side, the Popes power
      of so large a size, as <hi rend="italic">Bellarmine</hi> hath shaped, is no whit pleasing to
      the L. Cardi- nals eye. For in case the King should be vniustly deposed by the Pope <hi
       rend="italic">not well informed</hi>, he is not of the minde the Kingdome should stoupe to
      the Popes behests, but will rather haue the Kingdome to deale by remonstrance, and to referre
      the cause unto the Council: Wherein he makes the Council to be of more absolute and supreme
      authority then the Pope; a straine to which the holy father will neuer lend his eare. And yet
      doubtlesse, the Council required in this case must be vniuersall; wherein the French, for so
      much as they stand firme for the King and his cause, can be no Iudges: and in that regard the
      L. Cardinal requireth onely the presence of the French Church. Who seeth not here into what
      pickle the French cause is brought by this meanes ? The Bishops of <hi rend="italic"
       >Italie</hi> forsooth, of <hi rend="italic">Spaine</hi>, of <hi rend="italic">Sicilie</hi>,
      of <hi rend="italic">Germanie</hi>, the subiects of Soueraignes many times at pro- fessed or
      priuie enemitie with <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, shall haue the cause compremitted and
      referred to their iudgement, whether the Kingdome of <hi rend="italic">France</hi> shall driue
      out her Kings, and shall kindle the flames of seditious troubles, in the very heart and bowels
      of the Realme. But is it not possible, that a King may lacke the loue of his owne subiects,
      and they taking the vantage of that occasion, may put him to his trumps in his owne Kingdome ?
      Is it not possible, that calumniations whereby a credulous Pope hath beene seduced, may in
      like maner deceiue some part of a credulous people ? Is it not possible that one part of the
      people may cleaue to the Popes Faction, another may hold and stand out for the Kings rightfull
      cause, and ciuill warres may be kindled by the splene of these two sides ? Is it not possible,
       <pb n="208"/> that his Holinesse will not rest in the remonstrances of the French, and will
      no further pursue his cause ? And whereas now a dayes a Generall Councill cannot be held,
      except it be called and assembled by the Popes authority; is it credible, the Pope will take
      order for the conuocation of a Council, by whom he shall be iudged ? And how can the Pope be
      President in a Councill, where himselfe is the party impleaded ? and to whom the sifting of
      his owne sentence is referred, as it were to Committies, to examine whether it was denounced
      according to Law, or against Iustice ? But in the meane time, whilest all these remonstrances
      and addresses of the Council are on foot; behold, the Royall Maiestie of the King hangeth as
      it were by loose gimmals, and must stay the iudgement of the Council to whom it is referred.
      Well: what if the Councill should happe to be two or three yeeres in assembling, and to
      continue or hold eighteene yeeres, like the Councill of <hi rend="italic">Trent</hi>; should
      not poore <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, I beseech you, be reduced to a very bad plight ?
      should she not be in a very wise and warme taking ? To be short; His Lordships whole speach
      for the vntying of this knot, not onely sur- mounteth possiblitie, but is stuft with
      ridiculous toyes. This I make manifest by his addition in the same passage. <hi rend="italic"
       >If the Pope deceiued in fact, shall rashly and vniustly declare the King to be an heretike;
       then the Popes declaration shall not be seconded with actual deposition, vnles the Realme
       shall consent vnto the Kings depos- ing</hi>. What needes any man to bee instructed in this
      doctrine ? Who doth not knowe, that a King, so long as he is vpheld and maintained in his
      Kingdome by his people, cannot actually and effectually be deposed from his Throne ? Hee that
      speaketh such language and phrase, in effect saith, and saith no more then this: A King is
      neuer depriued of his Crowne, so long as he can keepe his Crowne on his head: a King is neuer
      turned and stript naked, so long as he can keepe his cloathes on his backe: a King is neuer
      deposed, so long as he can make the stronger partie and side against his enemies: in briefe, a
      King is King, and shall still remaine King, so long as he can hold the possession of his
      Kingdome, and sit fast in his Chaire of Estate. Howbeit, let vs here by the way, take notice
      of these words vttered by his Lordship: <hi rend="italic">Thatfor the deposing of a King, the
       consent of the people must be obtained</hi>: For by these words the people are exalted aboue
      the King, and are made the Iudges of the Kings deposing. </p>
     <p>But here is yet a greater matter: For that Popes may erre in faith, it is ac- knowledged by
      Popes themselues:<note anchored="true" place="foot">Can. Si Papa, Dist. 40. Nisi sit a fide
       deuius. </note> For some of them haue condemned Pope <hi rend="italic">Honorius</hi> for a
      Monothelite: S. <hi rend="italic">Hierome</hi>, and S. <hi rend="italic">Hilarius</hi>, and S.
       <hi rend="italic">Athanasius</hi> doe testifie, that Pope <hi rend="italic">Liberius</hi>
      started aside, and subscribed to <hi rend="italic">Arrianisme</hi>: Pope <hi rend="italic"
       >Iohn</hi> 23. was condemned in the Councill of <hi rend="italic">Constance</hi>, for
      maintaining there is neither hell not heauen: Diuerse other Popes haue been tainted with
      errour in faith. If therefore any Pope hereticall in himselfe, shall depose an Orthodoxe King
      for heresie; can it be imagined, that he which boasts himselfe to beare all <pb n="209"/>
      diuine and humane lawes in the priuy coffer or casket of his breast,<note anchored="true"
       place="foot"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Omnia jura in scrinio pectoris.</foreign>
      </note> will stoope to the remonstrances of the French, and vayle to the reasons which they
      shall pro- pound, though neuer so justifiable, and of neuer so great validitie ? And how can
      he, that may be infected with damnable heresie (when himselfe is not alwayes free from
      heresie) be a iudge of heresie in a King ? In this question some are of opinion, that as a
      man, the Pope may fall into error, but not as Pope. Very good: I demand then vpon the matter,
      wherefore the Pope doth not instruct and re- forme the man ? or wherefore the man doth not
      require the Popes instructions ? But whether a King be deposed by that man the Pope, or by
      that Pope the man, is it not all one ? is he not deposed ? Others affirme, the Pope may erre
      in a ques- tion of the fact, but not in a question of the right. An egregious gullery and im-
      posture: For if he may be ignorant whether Iesus Christ died for our sinnes, doubtles he may
      also be to seeke, whether we should repose all our trust and assured confidence in the death
      of Christ. Consider with me the Prophets of olde: They were all inspired and taught of God, to
      admonish and reprooue the Kings of Iudah and Israel: they neither erred in matter of fact, nor
      in point of right: they were as farre from being blinded and fetcht ouer by deceitfull calum-
      niations, as from beeing seduced by the painted shew of corrupt and false doctrine: As they
      neuer trode awry in matter of faith: so they neuer whetted the edge of their tongue or style
      against the faultlesse. Had it not beene a trimme deuice in their times, to say, that as <hi
       rend="italic">Esay</hi> and as <hi rend="italic">Daniel</hi> they might haue sunke into
      heresie, but not as Prophets ? For doubtlesse in this case, that <hi rend="italic">Esay</hi>
      would haue taken councell of the Prophet which was himselfe. To be short; If Kings are onely
      so long to be taken for Kings, vntill they shall be declared heretikes, and shall be deposed
      by the Pope; they continually stand in extreame danger, to vndergoe a very heauy and vniust
      sentence. Their safeth way were to know nothing, and to beleeue by proxie; least, if they
      should happen to talke of God, or to thinke of religion, they should be drawne for heretikes
      into the Popes Inquisition. </p>
     <p>All the examples hitherto produced by the Lord Cardinall on a rowe, are of a latter date,
      they lacke weight, are drawne from the time of bondage, and make the Popes themselues
      witnesses in their owne cause: They descant not vpon the point of deposition, but onely strike
      out and sound the notes of excommunication and interdiction, which make nothing at all to the
      musicke of the question. And therefore hee telleth vs (in kindnesse as I take it) more
      oftentimes then once or twice, that hee speaketh onely of the fact; as one that doeth
      acknowledge him- selfe to bee out of the right: Hee relates things done, but neuer what should
      bee done: which, as the Iudicious know, is to teach nothing. <pb n="210"/>

     <head> THE SECOND INCONVENIENCE EXAMINED.</head>
     <p>THE second Inconuenience like to grow, (as the Lord Cardinall seemeth to be halfe afraid)
       <note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag. 86.</note> if the Article of the third Estate might
      haue passed with approba- tion, is couched in these words: <hi rend="italic">Lay-men shall by
       authoritie bee strengthened with power, to iudge in matters of Religion; as also to determine
       the doctrine comprised in the said Article to haue requisite conformitie with Gods word: yea
       they shall haue it in their hands to compell Ecclesiastics by necessitie, to sweare, preach,
       and teach the opinion of the one side, as also by Sermons and publike writings to impugne the
       other</hi>. This inconuenience he aggrauateth with swelling words, and breaketh out into
      these vehement exclamations: O <hi rend="italic">reproach, O scandall, O gate set open to a
       world of heresies</hi>. He therefore laboureth both by reasons, and by authorities of holy
      Scripture, to make such vsurped power of Laics, a fowle, shameful, and odious practise. In the
      whole, his Lordship toyles himselfe in vaine, &amp; maketh suppositions of castles in the
      aire. For in preferring this Article, the third Estate haue born themselues not as iudges or
      vmpires, but altogether as petitioners: re- questing the said Article might be received into
      the number of the Parliament bookes to bee presented vnto the King and his Counsell, vnto whom
      in all humili- tie they referred the iudgment of the said Article; conceiuing all good hope
      the Clergie and Nobilitie would be pleased to ioyne for the furtherance of their humble
      petition. They were not so ignorant of State-matters, or so vnmindfull of their owne places
      and charges, to beare themselues in hand, that a petition put vp and preferred by the third
      Estate, can carry the force of a Law or Statute, so long as the other two Orders withstand the
      same, and so long as the King himselfe holds backe his Royall consent. Besides, the said
      Article was not propounded as a point of Religious doctrine; but for euer after to remaine and
      continue a funda- mentall Law of the Common-wealth and State it selfe, the due care whereof
      was put into their handes, and committed to their trust. If the King had ratified the said
      Article with Royall consent, and had commanded the Clergie to put in execu- tion the contents
      thereof; it had bene their duetie to see the Kings will and pleasure fulfilled, as they are
      subiects bound to giue him aide in all things, which may any way serue to procure the safetie
      of his life, and the tranquilitie of his Kingdome: Which if the Clergie had performed to the
      vttermost of their power, they had not shewed obedience as vnderlings, vnto the third Estate,
      but vnto the King alone; by whom such command had bene imposed, vpon suggestion of his
      faithfull subiects, made the more watchfull by the negligence of the Clergie; whom they
      perceiue to be lincked with stricter bandes vnto the Pope, then they are vnto their King. Here
      then the Cardinall fights with meere shadowes, and mooues a doubt whereof his aduersaries haue
      not so much as once thought in a dreame: But yet, according to his great dexteritie and
      nimblenesse of spirit, by this deuice he cunningly takes vpon him to giue the King a lesson
      with more <pb n="211"/> libertie; making semblance to direct his masked Oration to the
      Deputies of the people, when hee shooteth in effect, and pricketh at his King, the Princes
      also and Lords of his Counsell, whom the Cardinall compriseth vnder the name of Laics; whose
      iudgment (it is not vnlikely) was apprehended much better by the Clergie, then the iudgement
      of the third Estate. Now these are the men whom he tearmes intruders into other mens charges,
      and such as open a gate for I wot not how many legions of heresies, to rush into the Church:
      For if it be proper to the Clergie and their Head, to iudge in this cause of the Right of
      Kings; then the King himselfe, his Princes, and Nobilitie, are debarred and wiped of all
      iudgement in the same cause, no lesse then the representatiue body of the people. </p>
     <p>Well then, the L. Cardinall<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag. 61.</note> showres downe
      like haile sundry places and testimonies of Scripture, where the people are commanded to haue
      their Pastors in singular loue, and to beare them all respects of due obseruance. Be it so;
      yet are the said passages of Scripture no barre to the people, for their vigilant circum-
      spection, to preserue the life and Crowne of their Prince, against all the wicked enterprises
      of men stirred vp by the Clergie, who haue their Head out of the King- dome, and hold
      themselues to be none of the Kings subiects: a thing neuer spoken by the sacrificing Priests
      and Prelates, mentioned in the passages alleadged by the Lord Cardinal. He likewise produceth
      two Christian Emperours,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag. 68. </note>
      <hi rend="italic">Constantine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Valentinian</hi> by name; the first
      refusing to meddle with iudgement in Episcopall causes: the other forbearing to iudge of
      subtile Questions in Diuinity, with protestation, that <hi rend="italic">Hee would neuer bee
       so curious, to diue into the streames, or sound the bottome of so deepe matters</hi>. But who
      doth not know, that working and prouid- ing for the Kings indemnitie and safetie, is neither
      Episcopall cause, nor matter of curious and subtile inquisition ? The same answere meets with
      all the rest of the places produced by the L. Cardinal out of the Fathers. And that one for
      example, out of <hi rend="italic">Gregory Nazianzenus</hi>,<note anchored="true" place="foot"
        ><foreign xml:lang="lat">Orat. ad ciues timore perculsos</foreign>. </note> is not cited by
      the Cardinall with faire dealing. For <hi rend="italic">Gregory</hi> doeth not boord the
      Emperour himselfe, but his Deputy or L. President, on this maner: <hi rend="italic">For we
       also are in authoritie and place of a Ruler, we haue command aswell as your selfe</hi>:<note
       anchored="true" place="foot"><foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/rxomen ga\r kai\ au)toi\</foreign>
      </note> wheras the L. Cardinal with foule play, turnes the place in these termes, <hi
       rend="italic">We also are Emperours</hi>. Which words can beare no such inter- pretation, as
      well because he to whom the Bishop then spake, was not of Imperiall dignitie; as also because
      if the Bishop himselfe, a Bishop of so small a citie as <hi rend="italic">Nazianzum</hi>, had
      qualified himselfe Emperour, hee should haue passed all the bounds of modestie, and had shewed
      himselfe arrogant aboue measure. For as touching subiection due to Christian Emperours, hee
      freely acknowledgeth a little before, <hi rend="italic">that himselfe and his people are
       subiect vnto the superiour powers,<note anchored="true" place="foot"><foreign
         xml:lang="greek">u(potelei=s fo/rou</foreign>.</note> yea bound to pay them tribute</hi>.
      The historie of the same <hi rend="italic">Gregories</hi> life doeth testifie, that he was
      drawen by the <hi rend="italic">Arrians</hi> before the Consuls iudgement seate, and from
      thence returned acquitted, without either stripes or any other kinde of con- <pb n="212"/>
      tumelious entreatie and vse: yet now at last vp starts a Prelate, who dares make this good
      Father vaunt himselfe to be an Emperour. It is willingly granted, that Emperours neuer
      challenged, neuer arrogated, to bee Soueraigne Iudges in con- trouersies of doctrine and
      faith; neuerthelesse it is clearer then the Sunnes light at high noone, that for moderation at
      Synods, for determinations and orders established in Councils, and for the discipline of the
      Church, they haue made a good and a full vse of their Imperiall authoritie. The first
       Council<note anchored="true" place="foot">Vide Canones Graecos a Tilio editos. </note> held
      at <hi rend="italic">Con- stantinople</hi>, beares this title or inscription; <hi
       rend="italic">The dedication of the holy Synode to the most religious Emperour</hi>
      Theodosius <hi rend="italic">the Great, to whose will and pleasure they haue submitted these
       Canons by them addressed and established in Councill</hi>. And there they also beseech the
      Emperour, to confirme and approue the said Canons. The like hath bene done by the Council of
       <hi rend="italic">Trullo</hi>, by whom the Canons of the fift and sixt Councils were put
      foorth and published. This was not done, because Em- perours tooke vpon them to bee infallible
      Iudges of doctrine; but onely that Emperours might see and iudge, whether Bishops (who feele
      the pricke of am- bition as other men doe) did propound nothing in their Conuocations and Con-
      sultations, but most of all in their Determinations, to vndermine the Emperours authoritie, to
      disturbe the tranquilitie of the Common-wealth, and to crosse the determinations of precedent
      Councils. Now to take the cognizance of such matters out of the Kings hand or power; what is
      it but euen to transforme the King into a standing Image, to wring and wrest him out of all
      care of himselfe and his Kingly Charge, yea to bring him downe to this basest condition, to
      be- come onely an executioner, and (which I scorne to speake) the vnhappy hangman of the
      Clergies will, without any further cognizance, not so much as of matters which most neerely
      touch himselfe, and his Royall estate ? </p>
     <p>I grant it is for Diuinitie Scholes, to iudge how farre the power of the Keyes doth stretch:
      I grant againe, that Clerics both may, and ought also to display the colours and ensignes of
      their censures against Princes, who violating their publike and solemne oath, doe raise and
      make open warre against Iesus <hi rend="italic">Christ:</hi> I grant yet againe, that in this
      case they need not admit Laics to be of their coun- sell, nor allow them any scope or libertie
      of iudgement. Yet all this makes no barre to Clerics, for extending the power of their keyes,
      many times a whole degree further then they ought; and when they are pleased, to make vse of
      their said power, to depriue the people of their goods, or the Prince of his Crowne: all this
      doeth not hinder Prince or people from taking care for the preseruation of their owne rights
      and estates, nor from requiring Clerics to shew their cards, and produce their Charts, and to
      make demonstration by Scripture, that such power as they assume and challenge, is giuen them
      from God. For to leaue the Pope absolute Iudge in the same cause, wherein hee is a partie, and
      (which is the strongest rampier and bulwarke, yea the most glorious and eminent point of his
      domination) to arme him with power to vnhorse Kings out of their seates; what <pb n="213"/> is
      it else but euen to draw them into a state of despaire for euer winning the day, or preuailing
      in their honourable and rightful cause ? </p>
     <p>It is moreouer granted, if a King shall command any thing directly contrary to Gods word,
      and tending to the subuerting of the Church; that Clerics in this case ought not onely to
      dispense with subiects for their obedience, but also ex- presly to forbid their obedience: For
      it is alwayes better to obey God then man. Howbeit in all other matters, whereby the glory and
      maiestie of God is not impeached or impaired, it is the duety of Clerics to plie the people
      with wholesome exhortation to constant obedience, and to auert by earnest disswasions the said
      people from tumultuous reuolt and seditious insurrection. This practise vnder the Pagan
      Emperours, was held and followed by the ancient Christians; by whose godly zeale and patience
      in bearing the yoke, the Church in times past grew and flourished in her happy and plentifull
      increase, farre greater then Poperie shall euer purchase and attaine vnto by all her cunning
      deuices and sleights: as namely by degrading of Kings, by interdicting of Kingdoms, by
      apposted murders, and by Diabolicall traines of Gunne-powder-mines. </p>
     <p>The places of Scripture alleadged in order by the Cardinal, in fauour of those that stand
      for the Popes claime of power and authoritie to depose Kings, are cited with no more sincerity
      then the former: <hi rend="italic">They alledge</hi> (these are his words) <hi rend="italic"

      Priest- hood. Both false and contrary to the tenour of trewth in the sacred history: For <hi
       rend="italic">Saul</hi> was neuer deposed according to the sense of the word (I meane, <hi
       rend="italic">depose)</hi> in the present question; to wit, as deposing is taken for
      despoiling the King of his royall dignitie, and reducing the King to the condition of a

      held the title of King, and continued in possession of his Kingdome, euen to his dying day.
      Yea, the Scripture styles him King, euen to the periodicall and last day of his life, by the
      testimony of <hi rend="italic">Dauid</hi> himselfe, who both by Gods promise, and by precedent
      vnction, was then heire apparant as it were to the Crown, in a maner then ready to gird and
      adorne the temples of his head. For if <hi rend="italic">Samuel</hi>, by Gods commandement,
      had then actually remooued <hi rend="italic">Saul</hi> from his Throne, doubt- lesse the whole
      Church of Israel had committed a grosse errour, in taking and honouring <hi rend="italic"
       >Saul</hi> for their King, after such deposition: doubtlesse the Prophet <hi rend="italic"
       >Samuel</hi> himselfe, making knowen the Lords Ordinance vnto the people, would haue enioyned
      them by strict prohibition to call him no longer the King of Israel: Doubtlesse, <hi

      vntrewth, in as much as the sacred historie begins the computation of the yeeres of <hi
       rend="italic">Dauids</hi> Reigne, from the day of <hi rend="italic">Sauls</hi> death. Trew it
      is, that in the I. Sam. cap. 15. <hi rend="italic">Saul</hi> was denounced by Gods owne
      sentence, a man reiected, and as it were excommunicated out of the Kingdome, that hee should
      not rule and reigne any longer as King ouer Israel; neuerthelesse, the said sentence was not
      put in execution, before the day when God, executing vpon <hi rend="italic">Saul</hi> an
      exemplarie iudge- ment, did strike him with death. From whence it is manifest and cleare, that
      when <hi rend="italic">Dauid</hi> was annointed King by <hi rend="italic">Samuel</hi>, that
      action was onely a promise,<note anchored="true" place="foot">1. Sam. 16. 23.</note> and a
      testimony of the choice, which God had made of <hi rend="italic">Dauid</hi> for succession
      immediately after <hi rend="italic">Saul</hi>; and not a present establishment, inuestment, or

      <hi rend="italic">Rehoboam was deposed by Ahiah the Prophet, from his Royall right ouer the
       tenne Tribes of Israel, because his father Salomon had played the Apostata, in falling from
       the Law of God</hi>. This I say also is more, then the trewth of the sacred history doeth
      afoard: For <hi rend="italic">Ahiah</hi> neuer spake to <hi rend="italic">Rehoboam</hi> (for
      ought we reade,) nor brought vnto him any message from the Lord; As for the passagequoted by
      the L. Cardinal out of 3. <hi rend="italic">Reg</hi>. chap. 11 . it hath not reference to the
      time of <hi rend="italic">Rehoboams</hi> raigne, but rather indeed to Salomons time: nor doeth
      it carry the face of a iudicatorie sentence for the Kings deposing, but rather of a
      Propheticall predic- tion: For how could <hi rend="italic">Rehoboam</hi>, before hee was made
      King, be depriued of the Kingdome ? Last of all, but worst of all; to alleadge this passage
      for an example of a iust sentence in matter of deposing a King, is to approoue the disloyall
      treacherie of a seruant against his master, and the rebellion of <hi rend="italic"
       >Ieroboam</hi> branded in Scripture with a marke of perpetuall infamie for his wickednesse

      <hi rend="italic">King Achab was deposed by Elias the Prophet, because he imbraced false

       >Achab</hi> lost his crowne and his life both together. The Scripture, that speaketh not
      according to mans fancie, but according to the trewth, doeth extend and number the yeeres of
       <hi rend="italic">Achabs</hi> raigne, to the time of his death. Predictions of a Kings ruine,
      are no sentences of deposition. <hi rend="italic">Elias</hi> neuer gaue the subiects of <hi

      inckling of any such absolution; neuer set vp, or placed any other King in <hi rend="italic"
       >Achabs</hi> throne. </p>
     <p>That of the L. Cardinall <note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag. 68.</note> a little after,
      is no lesse vntrew: <hi rend="italic">That King Vzziah was driuenfrom the conuersation of the
       people by Azarias the Priest, and thereby the</hi>
      <pb n="215"/>
      <hi rend="italic">administration of his Kingdome was left no longer in his power</hi>. Not so:
      For when God had smitten <hi rend="italic">Vzziah</hi> with leprosie in his forehead, he
      withdrew himselfe,<note anchored="true" place="foot">2. Chro. 26. </note> or went out into an
      house apart, for feare of infecting such as were whole by his con- tagious disease. The high
      Priest smote him not with any sentence of deposition, or denounced him suspended from the
      administration of his Kingdome. No: the dayes of his raigne are numbred in Scripture, to the
      day of his death. And whereas the Priest, according to the Law in the 13. of <hi rend="italic"
       >Leuit</hi>. iudged the King to be vncleane; he gaue sentence against him, not as against a
      criminal person, and thereby within the compasse of deposition; but as against a diseased
      body: For the Law inflicteth punishments, not vpon diseases, but vpon crimes. Hereupon,
      whereas it is recorded by Iosephus <note anchored="true" place="foot">Antiq. 1. 9. cap.
       11.</note> in his Antiquities, that <hi rend="italic">Vzziah</hi> led a priuate, and in a
      maner, a solitarie life; the said author doeth not meane, that <hi rend="italic">Vzziah</hi>
      was deposed, but onely that he disburdened himselfe of care to mannage the publique affaires. </p>
     <p>The example of <hi rend="italic">Mattathias</hi>,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag.
       69.</note> by whom the Iewes were stirred vp to rebel against <hi rend="italic"
       >Antiochus</hi>, is no better worth: For in that example we finde no sentence of deposition,
      but onely an heartning and commotion of a people then grieuously afflicted and oppressed. He
      that makes himselfe the ringleader of conspiracie against a King, doeth not foorthwith assume
      the person, or take vp the office and charge of a Iudge, in forme of Law, and iuridically to
      depriue a King of his Regall rights, and Royall prerogatiues. <hi rend="italic"
       >Mattathias</hi> was chiefe of that conspiracie, not in qualitie of Priest, but of
      cheiftaine, or leader in warre and a man the best qualified of all the people. Things acted by
      the suddaine violence of the base vulgar, muste not stand for Lawes, nor yet for proofes and
      arguments of ordinarie power, such as the Pope challengeth to himselfe, and appropriateth to
      his triple-Crowne. </p>
     <p>These be our solide answeres: we disclaime the light armour which the L. Cardinall<note
       anchored="true" place="foot">Page 67.</note> is pleased to furnish vs withall, forsooth to
      recreate himselfe, in rebat- ing the points of such weapons, as hee hath vouchsafed to put
      into our hands. Now it wil be worth our labour to beate by his thrusts, fetch from the
      ordinary mission of the New Testament, from leprosie, stones, and locks of wooll: A leach no
      doubt of admirable skill, one that for subiecting the Crownes of Kings vnto the Pope, is able
      to extract arguments out of stones; yea, out of the leprosie, and the drie scab, onely
      forsooth because heresie is a kind of leprosie, and an heretike hath some affinitie with a
      leper. But may not his <hi rend="italic">Quoniam</hi>, bee as fitly applyed to any contagious
      and inueterate vice of the minde beside heresie ? His warning- piece <note anchored="true"
       place="foot">Page 66.</note> therefore is discharged to purpose, whereby hee notifies that
      hee pretendeth to handle nothing with resolution: For indeed vpon so weake arguments, a
      resolution is but ill-fauouredly and weakely grounded. </p>
     <p>His bulwarkes thus beaten downe, let vs now view the strength of our owne. First, he makes
      vs to fortifie on this maner: <hi rend="italic">They that are for the negatiue, doe</hi>
      <pb n="216"/>
      <hi rend="italic">alleadge the authoritie of</hi> S. Paul; <hi rend="italic">Let euery soule

       ordinance of God. And likewise that of</hi> S. Peter; <hi rend="italic">Submit your selues,
       whether it be vnto the King, as vnto the superiour, or vnto gouernours, &amp;c. Vpon these
       passages, and the like, they in ferre, that the obedience is due to Kings by the Law of God,
       and not dispensable by any Spirituall or Temporall authoritie.</hi><note anchored="true"
       place="foot">Page 69.</note> Thus he brings vs in with our first weapon. But here the very
      chiefe sinew and strength of our argument, hee doeth wittingly balked and of purpose conceale:
      To wit; That all the Emperors of whom the said holy Apostles haue made any mention in their
      diuine Epistles, were professed enemies to CHRIST, Pagans, Infidels, fearefull and bloody
      Tyrants: to whom notwithstand- ing <hi rend="italic">euery soule</hi>, and therefore the
      Bishop of Rome for one, is commanded to sub- mit himselfe, and to professe subiection. Thus
      much <hi rend="italic">Chrysostome</hi> hath expresly taught in his Hom. 23. vpon the Epistle
      to the Romanes; <hi rend="italic">The Apostle giues this commandement vnto all: euen to
       Priests also, and cloistered Monkes not onely to Secular: be thou an Apostle, an Euangelist,
       a Prophet, &amp;.c</hi>. Besides, it is here worthy to be noted, that howsoeuer the Apostles
      rule is generall, and therefore bindeth all the faithfull in equall bands; yet is it
      particularly, directly, and of purpose addressed to the Church of Rome by S. <hi rend="italic"
       >Paul</hi>, as by one who in the spirit of an Apostle did foresee, that rebellion against
      Princes was to rise and spring from the citie of Rome. Now in case the Head of that Church by
      warrant of any priuiledge, contained in the most holy Register of Gods holy word, is exempted
      from the binding power of this generall precept or rule; did it not become his Lord- ship to
      shew by the booke, that it is a booke case, and to lay it foorth before that honourable
      assembly, who no doubt expected and waited to heare when it might fall from his learned lips ?
      But in stead of any such authenticall and canonicall confirmation, he flieth to a sleight
      shift, and with a cauill is bold to affirme the foundation, laid by those of our side, doeth
      no way touch the knot of the con- trouersie. Let vs heare him speake: <hi rend="italic">It is
       not in controuersie, whether obedience be due to kings by Gods Law, so long as they are
       kings, or acknowledged for Kings, but our point controuerted, is whether by Gods Law it be
       required, that hee who hath bene once recognised and receiuedfor King by the body of Estates,
       can at any time be taken and reputed as no King, that is to say can doe no maner of acte
       whereby hee may loose his right, and so cease to be saluted King</hi>. This answere of the L.
      Cardinall is the rare deuise, euasion, and starting hole of the <hi rend="italic"
       >Iesuites</hi>: In whose eares of delicate and tender touch, King-killing soundeth very
      harsh; but forsooth to vn-king a King first, and then to giue him the stab, that is a point of
      iust and trew descant: For to kill a King, once vnking'd by deposition, is not killing of a
      King: For the present, I haue one of that Iesuiticall Order in prison, who hath face enough to
      speake this language of Ashdod, and to maintaine this doctrine of the <hi rend="italic"
       >Iesuites</hi> Colledges. The L. Cardinall harpes vpon the same string; He can like
      subiection and obedience to the King, whilest he sitteth King: but his Holinesse must haue <pb
       n="217"/> all power, and giue order withall, to hoyst him out of his Royall Seat. I therefore
      now answer, that in very deed the former passages of S. <hi rend="italic">Paul</hi> and S. <hi
       rend="italic">Peter</hi> should come nothing neere the question, if the state of the question
      were such as he brings it, made and forged in his owne shop. But certes the states of the
      ques- tion is not, whether a King may doe some acte, by reason whereof hee may fall from his
      right, or may not any longer be acknowledged for King: For all our contention is, concerning
      the Popes power to vn-authorize Princes; whereas in the question framed and fitted by the L.
      Cardinal, not a word of the Pope. For were it granted and agreed on both sides, that a King by
      election might fal from his Kingdom, yet stil the knot of the question would hold, whether he
      can be dis- possessed of his Regal authoritie, by any power in the Pope, &amp; whether the
      Pope hath such fulnes of power, to strip a King of those Royall robes, rights, and reuenewes
      of the Crowne, which were neuer giuen him by the Pope; as also by what authoritie of holy
      Scripture, the Pope is able to beare out himselfe in this power, and to make it good. </p>
     <p>But here the L. Card.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Page 71.</note> stoutly saith in his
      owne defence by way of reioinder; <hi rend="italic">As one text hath, Let euery soule be
       subiect vnto the higher powers; in like manner an other text hath, Obey your Prelates, and be
       subiect vnto your Pastors: for they watch ouer your soules, as men that shall giue an accompt
       for your soules</hi>. This reason is void of reason, and makes against himselfe: For may not
      Prelates be obeyed and honoured, without Kings be deposed ? If Prelates preach the doc- trine
      of the Gospell, will they in the pulpit stirre vp subiects to rebell against Kings ? Moreouer,
      whereas the vniuersall Church in these daies is diuided into so many discrepant parts, that
      now Prelates neither doe nor can draw all one way; is it not exceeding hard, keeping our
      obedience towards God, to honour them all at once with due obedience ? Nay; is not here
      offered vnto me a dart out of the L. Cardinals armorie, to cast at himselfe ? For as God
      chargeth all men with obedience to Kings, and yet from that commaundement of God, the L.
      Cardinall would not haue it inferred, that Kings haue power to degrade Ecclesiasticall
      Prelates: euen so God giueth charge to obey Prelates, yet doeth it not follow from hence, that
      Prelates haue power to depose Kings. These two degrees of obedience agree well together, and
      are each of them bounded with peculiar and proper limits. </p>
     <p>But for so much as in this point, we haue on our side the whole auncient Church, which,
      albeit she liued and groned for many aages together vnder heathen Emperours, heretikes, and
      persecuters, did neuer so much as whisper a word about rebelling and falling from their
      Soueraigne Lords, and was neuer by any mortall creature freed from the oath of allegiance to
      the Emperour; the Cardinall is not vnwilling to graunt, that ancient Christians in those times
      were bound to performe such fidelity and allegiance, for as much as the Church (the Cardinall
      for shame durst not say the Pope) then had not absolued them of their oath. <pb n="218"/> No
      doubt a pleasant dreame, or a merry conceit rather, to imagine the Bishop of Rome was armed
      with power to take away the Empire of the world from <hi rend="italic">Nero</hi>, or <hi
       rend="italic">Claudius</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Domitianus</hi>; to whom it was not knowen,
      whether the citie of Rome had any Bishop at all. Is it not a master-iest, of a straine most
      ridiculous, to pre- suppose the Grand-masters and absolute Lords of the whole world, had a
      sent so dull, that the were not able to smell out, and to nose things vnder their owne noses ?
      that they saw so little with other mens eies and their owne, that within their capitall citie,
      they could not spie that Soueraigne armed with ordinary and lawfull authority to degrade, and
      to turne them out of their renowned Empire ? Doubtlesse the said Emperours, vassals belike of
      the Popes Empire, are to be held excused for not acknowledging and honouring the Pope in
      quality of their Lord, as became his vassals; because they did not know there was any such
      power in the world, as aftertimes haue magnified and adored vnder the qualitie of Pope: For
      the Bishops of Rome in those times, were of no greater authoritie, power, and means, then some
      of the Bishops are in these daies within my Kingdomes. </p>
     <p>But certes those Popes of that primitiue aage, thought it not expedient in the said times to
      draw their swords: they exercised their power in a more mild and soft kind of carriage toward
      those miserable Emperours, for three seuerall reasons alledged by the L. Cardinall. </p>
     <p>The first: because the Bishops then durst not by their censures whet and prouoke those
      Emperours, for feare of plunging the Church in a Sea of persecu- tions. But if I be not cleane
      voide of common sense, this reason serueth to charge not onely the Bishops of Rome, but all
      the auncient professors of Christ besides, with deepe dissimulation and hypocrisie: For it is
      all one as if he had professed, that all their obedience to their Soueraignes, was but
      counterfeit, and extorted, or wrong out of them by force; that all the submissiue
      supplications of the auncient Fathers, the assured testimonies and pledges of their
      allegiance, humili- tie, and patience, were but certaine formes of disguised speech,
      proceeding not freely from the suggestions of fidelity, but faintly and fainedly, or at least
      from the strong twitches and violent conuulsions of feare. Whereupon it followes, that all
      their torments and punishments, euen to the death, are wrongfully hon- oured with the title,
      and crowned with the crowne of Martyrdome; because their patience proceeded not from their
      owne free choice and election, but was taught by the force of necessitie, as by compulsion:
      and whereas they had not mu- tinously and rebelliously risen in armes, to asswage the
      scorching heat and burn- ing flames of tyrannicall persecuters, it was not for want of will,
      but for lacke of power. Which false and forged imputation, the Fathers haue cleared themselues
      of in their writings. <hi rend="italic">Tertullian</hi><note anchored="true" place="foot"

       >Socr. lib. 3. cap. 19. Theod, lib. 4. cap. 1. Sozom. lib. 6. cap. 1.</note> the Bishop of
       <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi> had fit opportunitie to draw the sword of his authoritie (if hee
      had then any such sword hanging at his Pontificall side) to make <hi rend="italic">Iulian</hi>
      feele the sharpe edge of his weapon, and thereby to pull him downe from the stately pearch of
      the Romane Empire. I say moreouer, that by this generall and sudden profession of the whole
       <hi rend="italic">Caesarian</hi> armie, <hi rend="italic">Wee are all Christians</hi>, it is
      clearly testified, that if his armie or souldiers were then addicted to Paganisme, it was
      wrought by compulsion, and cleane con- trary to their setled perswasion before: and then it
      followes, that with greater patience they would haue borne the deposing of <hi rend="italic"
       >Iulian</hi>, then if hee had suffered them to vse the libertie of their conscience. To bee
      short in the matter; S. <hi rend="italic">Augus- tine</hi>
      <note anchored="true" place="foot">August. in Psal. 124.</note> makes all whole, and by his
      testimony doeth euince, that <hi rend="italic">Iulians</hi> armie per- seuered in the faith of
      Christ. <hi rend="italic">The souldiers of Christ serued a Heathen Emperour: But when the
       cause of Christ was called in question, they acknowledged none but Christ in heauen: When the
       Emperour would haue them to serue, and to perfume his idols with frankincense, they gaue
       obedience to God, rather then to the Emperour</hi>. After which words, the very same words
      alleadged by the L. Cardinall <note anchored="true" place="foot">Page 82.</note> against
      himselfe doe follow; <hi rend="italic">They did then distinguish betweene the Lord Eternal,
       and the Lord temporall: neuerthelesse, they were subiect vnto the Lord temporall, for the
       Lord Eternall</hi>. It was therefore to pay God his duetie of obedience, and not for feare to
      incense the Emperour, or to draw persecution vpon the Church (as the L. Cardinal would made vs
      beleeue) that Christians of the Primitiue Church, and Bishops by their censures, durst not
      anger and prouoke their Emperours. But his Lordship by his coloured pretences doeth manifestly
      prouoke and stirre vp the <pb n="220"/> people to rebellion, so soone as they know their own
      strength to beare out a re- bellious practise: Whereupon it followes, that in case their
      conspiracie shall take no good effect, all the blame and fault must lie, not in their
      disloyalty and treason, but in the bad choice of their times for the best aduantage, and in
      the want of taking a trew sight of their owne weakenesse. Let stirring spirits be trained vp
      in such practicall precepts, let desperate wits be seasoned with such rules of dis- cipline;
      and what need we, or how can wee wonder they contriue Powder-con- spiracies, and practise the
      damnable art of parricides ? </p>
     <p>After <hi rend="italic">Iulian</hi>, his Lordship falles vpon <hi rend="italic"
       >Valentinian</hi> the younger, who maintain- ing Arrianisme with great and open violence,
      might haue bene deposed by the Christians from his Empire, and yet (say wee) they neuer
      dream'd of any such practise. Heere the L. Cardinall<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag.
       82.</note> maketh answere: <hi rend="italic">The Christians mooued with respect vnto the
       fresh memory both of the brother and father, as also vnto the weake estate of the sonnes
       young yeeres, abstained from all counsels and courses of sharper effect and operation</hi>.
      To which answere I replie: these are but friuolous coniec- tures, deuised and framed to ticle
      his owne fancie: For <hi rend="italic">had Valentinianus</hi> the younger beene the sonne of
      an <hi rend="italic">Arrian</hi>, and had then also attained to threescore yeeres of aage,
      they would neuer haue borne themselues in other fashion then they did, towards their Emperour.
      Then the Cardinall goeth on: The people would not abandon the factious and seditious party,
      but were so firme or obstinate rather for the faction, that <hi rend="italic">Valentinian</hi>
      for feare of the tumultuous vproares was constrained to giue way, and was threatened by the
      souldiers, that except hee would adhere vnto the Catholikes, they would yeeld him no
      assistance, nor stand for his partie. Now this answere of the L. Cardinall makes nothing to
      the purpose, concerning the Popes power to pull downe Kings from their stately nest. Let vs
      take notice of his proper consequence. <hi rend="italic">Valentinian</hi> was afraid of the
      popu- lar tumult at <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi>; the Pope therefore hath power to curbe
      Hereticall Kings by deposition. Now marke what distance is betweene <hi rend="italic"
       >Rome</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi>, what dif- ference betweene the people of <hi
       rend="italic">Milan</hi>, and the Bishop of <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>; betweene a popular
      tumult, and a iudicatorie sentence; betweene fact and right, things done by the people or
      souldiers of <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi>, and things to be done according to right and law by
      the Bishop of <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>; the same distance, the same difference (if not
      farre greater) is betweene the L. Cardinals antecedent and his consequent, betweene his
      reason, and the maine cause or argument which we haue in hand. The mad commotion of the people
      was not heere so much to bee regarded, as the sad in- struction of the Pastour, of their good
      and godly Pastour S. <hi rend="italic">Ambrose</hi>, so farre from hartening the people of <hi
       rend="italic">Milan</hi> to rebel, that being Bishop of <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi>, he
      offered himself to suffer Martydome: <hi rend="italic">If the Emperour abuse his Imperiall
       authority</hi>, (for so <hi rend="italic">Theodoret</hi> hath recited his words) <hi
       rend="italic">to tyrannize thereby, heere am I ready to suffer death</hi>. And what
      resistance he made against his L. Emperor, was onely by way of supplication in these termes;
       <hi rend="italic">Wee beseech thee</hi>, 0 Augustus, <hi rend="italic">as humble
       suppliants;</hi>
      <pb n="221"/>
      <hi rend="italic">we offer no resistance: we are not infeare, but weflie to supplication</hi>.

       wil goe and meet my torments. Shall I be drag'd to prison or to death ? I will take delight
       in both. Item,</hi> in his Oration to <hi rend="italic">Auxentius; I can afflict my soule

       can resist, nor ought in any other maner to make resistance.</hi><note anchored="true"

     <p><hi rend="italic">Iustinian</hi> the Emperour in his old aage fell into the heresie of the
       <hi rend="italic">Aphtharto- docites</hi>. Against <hi rend="italic">Iustinian</hi>, though
      few they were that fauoured him in that heresie, the Bishop of <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>
      neuer darted with violence any sentence of excom- munication, interdiction, or deposition. </p>
     <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ostrogot</hi> Kings in <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi>, the <hi
       rend="italic">Visigot</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Spaine</hi>, the <hi rend="italic"
       >Vandal</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi> were all addicted to the <hi rend="italic"
       >Arrian</hi> impietie, and some of them cruelly persecuted the trew professours. The <hi
       rend="italic">Visigot</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vandall</hi> were no neighbours to <hi
       rend="italic">Italie</hi>. The Pope thereby had the lesse cause to feare the stings of those
      waspes, if they had bene angred. The Pope for all that neuer had the humour to wrestle or
      iustle with any of the said Kings in the cause of deposing them from their Thrones. But espe-
      cially the times when the <hi rend="italic">Vandals</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Affricke</hi>,
      and the <hi rend="italic">Goths</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Italie</hi> by <hi rend="italic"
       >Belisarius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Narses</hi>, professours of the Orthodoxe Faith, were
      tyred with long warres, and at last were vtterly defeated in bloody battels, are to bee
      considered. Then were the times or neuer, for the Pope to vnsheath his weapons, and to vncase
      his ar- rowes of deposition; then were the times to draw them out of his quiuer, and to shoot
      at all such <hi rend="italic">Arrian</hi> heads; then were the times by dispensations to
      release their subiects of their oathes, by that peremptorie meanes to aide and strengthen the
      Catholique cause: But in that aage the said weapons were not knowne to haue bene hammered in
      the Pontificall forge. <hi rend="italic">Gregorie</hi> the I. made his boasts, that he was
      able to ruine the Lombards, (for many yeeres together sworne enemies to the Bishops of Rome)
      their state present, and the hope of all their future prosperitie. But he telleth vs, that by
      the feare of God before his eyes and in his heart, he was bridled and restrained from any such
      intent; as elsewhere we haue obserued:<note anchored="true" place="foot">In Apol. pro iuram.
       fidel. His owne words lib. 7. Epist. 1.</note>
      <hi rend="italic">If I would haue medled with practis- ing and procuring the death of the
       Lombards, the whole nation of the Lombards at this day had bene robbed of their Kings, Dukes,
       Earles, they had bene reduced to the tearmes of extreame confusion</hi>. He might at least
      haue deposed their King, (if the credit of the L. Cardinals iudgement be currant) without
      polluting or stayning his owne conscience. </p>
     <p>What can we tearme this assertion of the L. Cardinal, but open charging the most ancient
      Bishops of Rome with crueltie, when they would not succour the Church of CHRIST oppressed by
      tyrants, whose oppression they had power to represse by deposing the oppressors. Is it
      credible, that IESVS CHRIST hath giuen <pb n="222"/> a Commission to S. <hi rend="italic"
       >Peter</hi> and his successors for so many aages, without any power to execute their
      Commission, or to make any vse thereof by practise ? Is it credible, that hee hath giuen them
      a sword to bee kept in the scabbard, without drawing once in a thousand yeeres ? Is it
      credible, that in the times when Popes were most deboshed, abandoning themselues to all sorts
      of corrupt and vitious courses, as is testified by their owne flatterers and best affected
      seruants; it is credible that in those times they began to vnderstand the vertue &amp;
      strength of their Commission ? For if either feare or lacke of power, was the cause of holding
      their hands, and voluntarie binding of themselues to the Peace or good behauiour: wherefore is
      not some one Pope at least produced, who hath complained that he was hindered from executing
      the power that CHRIST had conferred vpon his Pontificall See ? Wherefore is not some one of
      the ancient and holy Fathers alledged, by whom the Pope hath bene aduised and exhorted to take
      courage, to stand vpon the vigor and sinewes of his Papall Office, to vnsheath and vncase his
      bolts of thunder against vngodly Princes, and grieuous enemies to the Church ? wherefore
      liuing vnder Christian and gracious Emperours, haue they not made knowne the reasons, why they
      were hindred from drawing the pretended sword; lest long custome of not vsing the sword so
      many aages, might make it so to rust in the scabbard, that when there should be occasion to
      vse the said sword, it could not be drawne at all; and lest so long custome of not vsing the
      same, should confirme prescription to their greater preiudice ? If weakenesse be a iust let,
      how is it come to passe, that Popes haue enterprised to depose <hi rend="italic">Philip the
       Faire, Lewis</hi> the XII, and ELIZABETH my predecessor of happy memorie; (to let passe
      others) in whom experience hath well proued, how great inequalitie was betweene their
      strengths ? Yea, for the most part from thence grow most grieuous troubles and warres, which
      iustly recoile and light vpon his owne head; as happened to <hi rend="italic">Gregorie</hi>
      the VII. and <hi rend="italic">Boniface</hi> the VIII. This no doubt is the reason, wherefore
      the Pope neuer sets in (for feare of such inconueniences) to blast a King with lightning and
      thunder of deposition, but when hee perceiues the troubled waters of the Kingdome by some
      strong faction setled in his Estate; or when the King is confined and bordered by some Prince
      more potent, who thirsteth after the prey, and is euer gaping for some occasion to picke a
      quarrell. The King standing in such estate, is it not as easie for the Pope to pull him downe,
      as it is for a man with one hand to thrust downe a tottering wall, when the groundsill is
      rotten, the studdes vnpind and nodding or bending towards the ground ? But if the King shall
      beare downe and breake the faction within the Realme; if hee shall get withall the vpper hand
      of his enemies out of the Kingdome; then the holy Father presents him with pardons neuer sued
      for, neuer asked; and in a fathers indul- gence forsooth, giues him leaue still to hold the
      Kingdome, that hee was not able by all his force to wrest and wring out of his hand, no more
      then the club of <hi rend="italic">Her- cules</hi> out of his fist. How many worthy Princes,
      incensed by the Pope, to conspire against Soueraigne Lords their Masters, and by open
      rebellion to worke some <pb n="223"/> change in their Estates, haue miscarried in the action,
      with losse of life, or honour, or both ? For example; <hi rend="italic">Rodulphus</hi> Duke of
       <hi rend="italic">Sueuia</hi> was eg'd on by the Pope, against <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi>
      IIII. of that name Emperour. How many massacres, how many desolations of Cities and townes,
      how many bloody battels ensued thereupon ? Let histories bee searched, let iust accompts be
      taken, and besides sieges layde to Cities, it will appeare by trew computation, that <hi
       rend="italic">Henry</hi> the IIII. and <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> the first, fought
      aboue threescore battels, in defence of their owne right against enemies of the Empire,
      stirred vp to armes by the Pope of Rome. How much Christian blood was then spilt in these
      bloody battels, it passeth mans wit, penne, or tongue to expresse. And to giue a little touch
      vnto matters at home; doeth not his Holinesse vnderstand right well the weakenesse of Papists
      in my Kingdome ? Doeth not his Holinesse neuerthelesse animate my Papists to rebellion, and
      forbid my Papists to take the Oath of Allegiance ? Doeth not his Holinesse by this meanes draw
      (so much as in him lyeth) persecution vpon the backes of my Papists as vpon rebels, and expose
      their life as it were vpon the open stall, to be sold at a very easie price ? All these
      examples, either ioynt or seuerall, are manifest and euident proofes, that feare to draw
      mischiefe and persecution vpon the Church, hath not barred the Popes from thundering against
      Emperours and Kings, when- soeuer they conceiued any hope, by their fulminations to aduance
      their greatnesse. </p>
     <p>Last of all; I referred the matter to the most possessed with preiudice, euen the very
      aduersaries, whether this doctrine, by which people are trained vp in subiection vnto Infidel
      or hereticall Kings, vntill the subiects be of sufficient strength to mate their Kings, to
      expell their Kings, and to depose them from their Kingdomes, doth not incense the Turkish
      Emperours and other Infidell Princes to roote outall the Christians that drawe in their yoke,
      as people that waite onely for a fit occasion to rebell, and to take themselues ingaged for
      obedience to their Lords, onely by constraint and seruile feare. Let vs therefore now conclude
      with <hi rend="italic">Ozius</hi>,<note anchored="true" place="foot"><foreign xml:lang="lat"
        >Apud Athan. in Epist. ad solitar. vitam agentes</foreign>.</note> in that famous Epistle
      speaking to <hi rend="italic">Constantius</hi> an Arrian heretike: <hi rend="italic">As hee
       that by secret practise or open violence would bereaue thee of thy Empire, should violate
       Gods ordinance: so bee thou touched with feare, least, by vsurping authoritie ouer Church
       matters, thou tumble not headlong into some hainous crime</hi>. Where this holy Bishop hath
      not vouchsafed to insert and mention the L. Cardinals excep- tion; to wit, the right of the
      Church alwaies excepted and saued, when she shall be of sufficient strength to shake off the
      yoke of Emperours. Neither speaks the same holy Bishop of priuate persons alone, or men of
      some particular condition and calling; but hee setteth downe a generall rule for all degrees,
      neuer to impeach imperial Maiesties upon any pretext whatsoever. </p>
     <p>As his Lordships first reason drawne from weakenesse is exceeding weake: so is thatwhich the
      L. Cardinall<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag. 77.</note> takes vp in the next place: <hi
       rend="italic">He tellethvs there is very great difference betweene Pagan Emperours, and
       Christian Princes: Pagan Emperours who neuer did homage to Christ, who neuer were by their
       subiects receiued, with condition</hi>
      <pb n="224"/>
      <hi rend="italic">to acknowledge perpetuall subiection vnto the Empire of Christ; who neuer
       were bound by oath and mutuall contract between Prince and subiect. Christian Princes who
       slide backe by Apostasie, degenerate by Arrianisme, or fall away by Mahometisme.</hi>
      Touching the latter of these two, (as his Lordshippe saith) <hi rend="italic">If they shall as
       it were take an oath, and make a vowe contrary to their first oath and vow made and taken
       when they were installed, and contrary to the condition vnder which they receiued the Scepter
       of their Fathers; if they withall shall turne persecutors of the Catholike re- ligion</hi>;
      touching these I say, the L. Cardinal holds, that without question they may bee remooued from
      their Kingdomes: He telleth vs not by whom, but euery where he meaneth by the Pope. Touching
      Kings deposed by the Pope vnder pretence of stupidity, as <hi rend="italic">Childeric</hi>; or
      of matrimoniall causes, as <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi> I. or for collating of benefices, as
       <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi> the Faire; not one word: By that point he easily glideth, and
      shuffles it vp in silence, for feare of distasting the Pope on the one side, or his auditors
      on the other. </p>
     <p>Now in alledging this reason, his Lordship makes all the world a witnes, that in deposing of
      Kings, the Pope hath no eye of regard to the benefit and securitie of the Church: For such
      Princes as neuer suckt other milke then that of Infidelitie and persecution of Religion, are
      no lesse noisome and pernicious vermin to the Church, then if they had sucked of the Churches
      breasts. And as for the great- nesse of the sinne or offence, it seemes to me there is very
      little difference in the matter. For a Prince that neuer did sweare any religious obedience to
      IESUS <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi>, is bound no lesse to such obedience, then if he had taken
      a solemne oath: As the sonne that rebelliously stands vp against his father, is in equall
      degree of sinne, whether he hath sworne or not sworne obedience to his father; because he is
      bound to such obedience, not by any voluntarie contract or couenant, but by the law of Nature.
      The commaundement of God to kisse the Sonne, whom the Father hath confirmed and ratified King
      of Kings, doeth equally bind all Kings, as well Pagans as Christians. On the other side, who
      denies, who doubts, that <hi rend="italic">Constantius</hi> Emperour at his first steppe or
      entrance into the Empire, did not sweare and bind himselfe by solemne vowe, to keepe the rules
      and to maintaine the precepts of the Orthodox faith, or that he did not receiue his fathers
      Empire vpon such condition? This notwithstanding, the Bishop of <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>
      pulled not <hi rend="italic">Constantius</hi> from his Imperiall throne, but <hi rend="italic"
       >Constantius</hi> remooued the Bishop of <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi> from his Papall See. And
      were it so, that an oath taken by a King at his consecration, and after violated, is a
      sufficient cause for the Pope to depose an Apostate or hereticall Prince; then by good
      consequence the Pope may in like sort depose a King, who beeing neither dead in Apostasie, nor
      sicke of Heresie, doeth neglect onely the due administration of iustice to his loyall
      subiects: For his oath taken at consecration importeth likewise, that he shall minister
      iustice to his people. A point wherein the holy Father is held short by the L. Cardinall, who
      dares prescribe new lawes to the Pope, and presumes to limit <hi rend="italic">his fulnesse of
       power</hi>, within certaine meeres and head-lands, extending the Popes power only <pb n="225"
      /> to the deposing of Christian Kings, when they turne Apostats forsaking the Catholike faith;
      and not such Princes as neuer breathed any thing but pure Paganisme, and neuer serued vnder
      the colours of Iesus Christ. Meanewhile his Lordship forgets, that King <hi rend="italic"
       >Attabaliba</hi> was deposed by the Pope from his King- dome of <hi rend="italic">Peru</hi>,
      and the said Kingdome was conferred vpon the King of <hi rend="italic">Spaine,</hi> though the
      said King of <hi rend="italic">Peru</hi> never forsook his heathen superstition; and though
      the turning of him out of his terrestriall Kingdome was no way to conuert him vnto the faith
      of Christ. Yea his Lordship <note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag. 77.</note> a little after
      telleth vs himselfe, that <hi rend="italic">Be the Turkes possession in the conquests that he
       maketh ouer Christians neuer so auncient, yet by no long tract of time whatsoeuer, can he
       gaine so much as a thumbes breadth of prescription</hi>: that is to say, the Turke for all
      that is but a disseisor, one that violently and wilfully keeps an other man from his owne, and
      by good right may be dispossessed of the same: whereas notwithstanding the Turkish Em- perours
      neuer fauoured nor sauoured Christianitie. Let vs runne ouer the ex- amples of Kings whom the
      Pope hath dared and presumed to depose; and hardly will any one be found, of whom it may be
      trewly auouched, that he hath taken an oath contrary to his oath of subiection to Iesus <hi
       rend="italic">Christ</hi>, or that he hath wilfully cast himselfe into Apostaticall
      defection. </p>
     <p>And certes to any man that weighs the matter with due consideration, it wil be found
      apparently false, that Kings of <hi rend="italic">France</hi> haue bene receiued of their sub-
      iects at any time, with condition to serue IESVS CHRIST. They were actually Kings before they
      came forth to the solemnitie of their sacring, before they vsed any stipulation or promise to
      their subiects. For in hereditary kingdoms, (nothing more certaine, nothing more
      vncontrouleable) the Kings death in- stantly maketh liuery and seisin of the Royaltie, to his
      next successour. Nor is it materiall to replie, that a King succeeding by right of
      inheritance, takes an oath in the person of his predecessor. For euery oath is personall,
      proper to the person by whom it is taken: and to God no liuing creature can sweare, that his
      owne sonne or his heire shall proue an honest man. Well may the father, and with great
      solemnitie, promise that he will exhort his heire apparant with all his power and the best of
      his endeauours, to feare God and to practise piety. If the fathers oath be agreeable to the
      dueties of godlinesse, the sonne is bound thereby, whether he take an oath, or take none. On
      the other side, if the fathers oath come from the puddles of impietie, the sonne is bound
      thereby to goe the contrary way. If the fathers oath concerne things of indifferent nature,
      and such as by the variety or change of times, become either pernicious or impossible; then it
      is free for the Kings next successor and heire, prudently to fit and proportion his Lawes vnto
      the times present, and to the best benefit of the Common-wealth. </p>
     <p>When I call these things to mind with some attention, I am out of all doubt, his Lordship is
      very much to seeke, in the right sense and nature of his Kings oath taken at his Coronation,
      to defend the Church, and to perseuere in the <pb n="226"/> Catholike faith: For what is more
      vnlike and lesse credible then this conceit, that after <hi rend="italic">Clouis</hi> had
      reigned 15. yeeres in the state of Paganisme, and then receiued holy Baptisme, he should
      become Christian vpon this condition, That in case hee should afterward reuolt from the Faith,
      it should then bee in the power of the Church, to turne him out of his Kingdome ? But had any
      such conditionall stipulation beene made by <hi rend="italic">Clouis</hi>, in very good
      earnest and trewth; yet would hee neuer haue intended, that his deposing should bee the acte
      of the Romane Bishop, but rather of those (whether Peeres or people, or whole body of the
      State) by whom he had bene aduanced to the Kingdome. Let vs heare the trewth, and this is the
      trewth: It is farre from the customary vse in <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, for their Kings
      to take any such oath, or to vse any such stipulation with their subiects. If any King or
      Prince wheresoeuer, doth vse an oath or solemne promise in these ex- presse termes, <hi
       rend="italic">Let me lose my Kingdome, or my life, be that day my last both for life and
       reigne, when I shall first reuolt from the Christian Religion</hi>: By these words he calleth
      vpon God for vengeance, hee vseth imprecation against his owne head: but hee makes not his
      Crowne to stoupe by this meanes to any power in the Pope, or in the Church, or in the people. </p>
     <p>And touching inscriptions vpon coynes, of which point his Lordship speaketh by the way;
      verely the nature of the money or coine (the stamping and minting whereof is one of the marks
      of the Prince his dignity and Soueraignty) is not changed by bearing the letters of Christ
      Name on the reuerse or on the front. Such characters of Christs Name, are aduertisements and
      instructions to the people, that in shewing and yeelding obedience vnto the King, they are
      obedient vnto the King, they are obedient vnto Christ; &amp; those Princes likewise, who are
      so wel aduised, to haue the most sacred Names inscribed and printed in their coines, doe take
      and acknowledge Iesus <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi> for supreme King of Kings. The said holy
      characters are no representation or profession, that any Kings Crowne dependeth vpon the
      Church, or can be taken away by the Pope. The L. Cardinal indeed so beareth vs in hand. But he
      inuerts the words of Iesus <hi rend="italic">Christ</hi>, and wrings them out of the right
      ioynt: For Christ without all ambiguitie and circum- locution, by the image and inscription of
      the money, doeth directly and expressely prooue <hi rend="italic">Caesar</hi> to bee free from
      subiection, and entirely Soueraigne. Now if such a supreme and Soueraigne Prince, at any time
      shall bandie and combine against God, and thereby shall become a rebellious and perfidious
      Prince; doubtless for such disloyaltie he shall deserue, that God would take from him all hope
      of life eternall: and yet hereby neither Pope nor people hath reason to bee puft vp, in their
      power to depriue him of his temporall Kingdome. </p>
     <p>The L. Cardinall <note anchored="true" place="foot">Page 76.</note> saith besides; <hi
       rend="italic">The champions of the Popes power to depose Kings, doe expound that commandement
       of</hi> S. Paul, <hi rend="italic">whereby euery soule is made sub- iect vnto the superiour
       powers, to bee a prouisionall precept or caution accommodated to the times; and to stand in
       force, onely vntill the Church were growen in strength vn-</hi>
      <pb n="227"/>
      <hi rend="italic">to such a scantling, that it might be in the power of the faithfull, without
       shaking the pillars of Christian state, to stand in the breach, and cautelosly to prouide
       that none but Christian Princes might be receiued; according to the Law in Deut. Thou shalt
       make thee a King from among thy brethren</hi>. The reason whereupon they ground, is this: <hi
       rend="italic">Because</hi> Paul <hi rend="italic">saith, It is a shame for Christians to be
       iudged vnder vniust Infidels, in matters or businesse, which they had one against another:
       For which inconuenience,</hi> Iustinian <hi rend="italic">after prouided by Law; when hee
       ordeined that no Infidel nor Heretike might be admitted to the administration of iustice in
       the Common-wealth.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>In which words of the Cardinall, the word <hi rend="italic">Receiued</hi>, is to bee
      obserued espe- cially and aboue the rest: For by chopping in that word, hee doeth nimbly and
      with a tricke of <hi rend="italic">Legier demain</hi>, transforme or change the very state of
      the ques- tion. For the question or issue of the cause, is not about receiuing, establishing,
      or choosing a Prince; (as in those Nations where the Kingdome goes by election) but about
      doing homage to the Prince, when God hath setled him in the King- dome, and hath cast it vpon
      a Prince by hereditary succession: For that which is written, <hi rend="italic">Thou shalt
       make thee a King</hi>, doeth no way concerne and touch the people of <hi rend="italic"
       >France</hi> in these dayes: because the making of their King hath not of long time been tyed
      to their election. The passage therefore in Deuter. makes nothing to the purpose; no more then
      doth <hi rend="italic">Iustinians</hi> law: For it is our free and voluntary confession, that
      a Christian Prince is to haue speciall care of the Lawes, and to prouide that no vnbeleeuer be
      made Lord Chiefe-Iustice of the Land, that no Infidel be put in trust with administration of
      Iustice to the people. But here the issue doeth not direct vs to speake of Delegates, of
      subordinate Magistrates, and such as are in Commission from the Prince, but of the supreame
      Prince himselfe, the Soueraigne Magistrate ordained by nature, and confirmed by succession.
      Our question is, whether such a Prince can be vnthroned by the Pope, by whom he was not placed
      in the Throne; and whether the Pope can despoile such a Prince, of that Royaltie which was
      neuer giuen him by the Pope, vnder any pretended colour and imputation of heresie, of
      stupiditie, or infringing the priuiledges of Monaste- ries, or transgressing the Lawes and
      lines of holy Matrimonie. </p>
     <p>Now that S. <hi rend="italic">Pauls</hi> commandement which bindeth euery soule in the bands
      of subiection vnto the higher powers, is no precept giuen by way of <hi rend="italic"
       >prouiso</hi>, and onely to serue the times, but a standing and a perpetuall rule, it is
      hereby more than manifest. S. <hi rend="italic">Paul</hi> hath grounded this commandement vpon
      certaine rea- sons, not onely constant and permanent by their proper nature, but likewise
      necessary for euery state, condition, and reuolution of the times. His reasons; <hi
       rend="italic">Because all powers are ordained of God: because resisting of powers is
       resisting the ordinance of God: because the Magistrate beares the sword to execute iustice:
       because obedience and subiection to the Magistrate is necessary, not onely for feare of his
       wrath, or feare of punishment, but also for conscience sake</hi>. It is therefore a case
      grounded vpon conscience, it is not a Law deuised by humane wisedome; it is not fashionable to
      the qualities of the times. Apostolicall instructions for the right <pb n="228"/> informing of
      maners, are not changeable according to times and seasons. To vse the L. Cardinals language,
      and to follow his fancie in the matter, is to make way for two pestiferous mischiefes: First,
      let it be free and lawfull for Christians, to hold the commanding rules of GOD for
      prouisionall cautions, and what followes ? Men are ledde into the broad way of impietie, and
      the whole Scripture is wiped of all authoritie. Then againe, for the other mischiefe: The
      glorious triumphes of most blessed Martyrs in their vnspeakable torments and sufferings, by
      the L. Car- dinals position shall bee iudged vnworthy to weare the title and Crowne of Mar-
      tyrdome. How so ? Because (according to his new fiction) they haue giuen place to the violence
      and furie of heathen Magistrates, not in obedience to the necessary and certaine Commandement
      of God, but rather to a prouisionall direction, ac- commodated to the humours of the times.
      And therfore the L. Cardinal hath vsed none other clay wherewith to dawbe ouer his deuise, but
      plaine falsification of holy Scripture: For he makes the Apostle say to the Corinthians, <hi
       rend="italic">It is a shame for Christians to bee iudged vnder vnbeleeuing Magistrates</hi>;
      whereas in that whole context of Paul, there is no such matter. For when the Apostle saith,
       <hi rend="italic">I speake it euen to your shame</hi>; <note anchored="true" place="foot"
        ><foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\s e)ntroph\n de/gw</foreign>.</note> he doeth not say it is a
      shame for a beleeuer to be iudged vnder an Infidel, but he makes them ashamed of their vngodly
      course, and vn- christian practise, that in suing and impleading one another, they layd their
      actions of contention in the Courts of vnbeleeuing Iudges. The shame was not in bearing that
      yoke which God had charged their necks withall, but in deuouring and eating vp one an other
      with Writs of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi>, and with other Processes; as also in
      vncouering the shame, in laying open the shamefull parts and prankes played by Christians,
      before Infidels, to the great scandall of the Church. Here I say the L. Cardinall is taken in
      a tricke of manifest falsification. If therefore a King when he falls to play the heretike,
      deserueth to be deposed; why should not a Cardinall when he falls to play the iuggler with
      holy Scripture, deserue to be disrobed ? </p>
     <p>Meane while the indifferent Reader is to consider, how greatly this doctrine is preiudicial,
      and how full of danger, to Christians liuing vnder hereticall or Pagan Princes. For make it
      once knowne to the Emperour of Turkes, let him once get neuer so little a smacke of this
      doctrine; that Christians liuing vnder his Empire doe take Gods commandement, for obedience to
      Princes whom they count In- fidels, to be onely a prouisional precept for a time, and wait
      euery houre for all occasions to shake off the yoke of his bondage; doubtlesse he will neuer
      spare with all speed to roote the whole stocke, with all the armes and branches of Christians
      out of his dominions. Adde hereunto the L. Cardinals former determination; that possession
      kept neuer so long by the Turke in his Conquests ouer Christians, gaines him not by so long
      tract of time one inch of prescription; and it will appear, that his Lordship puts the Turkish
      Emperour in minde, and by his in- struction leades the said Emperour as it were by the hand,
      to haue no maner of <pb n="229"/> affiance in his Christian subiects; and withall to afflict
      his poore Christians with all sorts of most grieuous and cruell torments. In this regard the
      poore Christians of Grecia and Syria, must needs be very little beholden to his Lordship. As
      for my selfe, and my Popish Subiects, to whom 1 am no lesse then an heretike for- sooth am not
      I by this doctrine of the Cardinall, pricked and whetted against my naturall inclination, to
      turne clemencie into rigour; seeing that by his doctrine my subiects are made to beleeue, they
      owe me subiection onely by way of <hi rend="italic">prouiso,</hi> and with waiting the
      occasion to worke my vtter destruction and finall ruine; the rather, because Turkes,
      miscreants, and heretikes are marshalled by the Cardinall in the same ranke; and heretikes are
      counted worse, yea more iustly deposeable, then Turkes and Infidels, as irreligious breakers
      and violaters of their oath ? Who seeth not here how great indignitie is offered to me a
      Christian King, paral- leled with Infidels, reputed worse then a Turke, taken for an vsurper
      of my King- domes, reckoned a Prince, to whom subiects owe a forced obedience by way of
      prouision, vntill they shall haue meanes to shake off the yoke, and to bare my temples of the
      Crowne, which neuer can be pulled from the sacred Head, but with losse of the head it selfe ? </p>
     <p>Touching the warres vndertaken by the <hi rend="italic">French, English</hi>, and <hi
       rend="italic">Germaines</hi>, in their expedition for Ierusalem, it appeares by the issue and
      euent of the said warres, that God approoued them not for honourable. That expedition was a
      deuise and inuention of the Pope, whereby he might come to be infeoffed in the Kingdomes of
      Christian Princes.. For then all such of the <hi rend="italic">French, English</hi>, or <hi
       rend="italic">Germaines</hi>, as vndertooke the Croisade, became the Popes meere vassals.
      Then all robbers by the high way side, adulterers, cutthroats, and base bankerupts, were
      exempted from the Secular and Ciuill power, their causes were sped in Con- sistorian Courts,
      so soone as they had gotten the Crosse on their cassocks or coat- armours, and had vowed to
      serue in the expedition for the Leuant. Then for the Popes pleasure and at his commaundement,
      whole countryes were emptied of their Nobles and common souldiers. Then they made long marches
      into the Leuant: For what purpose ? Onely to die vpon the points of the <hi rend="italic"
       >Saracens</hi> pikes, or by the edge of their barbarous courtelasses, battle-axes, fauchions,
      and other weapons, without any benefit and aduantage to themselues or others. Then the Nobles
      were driuen to sell their goodly Mannors, and auncient demaines to the Church-men, at vnder
      prises and low rates; the very roote from which a great part of the Church and Church-mens
      reuenewes hath sprung and growne to so great height. Then, to be short, his most bountifull
      Holiness <note anchored="true" place="foot">See the Bull of Innoc. 3. at the end of the
       Latter. Conc.</note> gaue to any of the riffe-raffe-rank, that would vndertake this
      expedition into the Holy land, a free and full pardon for all his sinnes, besides a degree of
      glory aboue the vulgar in the Celestial Paradise. Military vertue, I confesse, is commendable
      and honourable; prouided it bee employed for iustice, and that generous noblenesse of valiant
      spirits bee not vnder a colour and shadow of piety, fetcht ouer with some casts or deuises of
      Italian cunning. <pb n="230"/>

     <p>Now let vs obserue the wisedome of the Lord Cardinall through this whole discourse. His
      Lordship is pleased in his Oration, to cite certaine few passages of Scripture, culls and
      picks them out for the most gracefull in shewe: leues out of his whole troupes of honourable
      witnesses, vpon whose testimonie, the Popes themselues and their principall adherents doe
      build his power to depose Kings, and to giue order for all Temporall causes. Take a sight of
      their best and most honourable witnesses. <hi rend="italic">Peter</hi> said to Christ, <hi
       rend="italic">See here two swords</hi>; and Christ answered, <hi rend="italic">It is
       sufficient</hi>. Christ said to <hi rend="italic">Peter, Put vp thy sword into thy
       sheath.</hi> God said to Ieremie,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Ier. 1.</note>
      <hi rend="italic">I haue established thee ouer Nations and Kingdomes. Paul</hi><note

       >The spirituall man discerneth all things</hi>. Christ said to his Apostles, <hi

      forsooth to loose the oath of allegiance. <hi rend="italic">Moses</hi> said, <hi rend="italic"
       >In the beginning God created the heauen and the earth</hi>. Vpon these passages, Pope <hi
       rend="italic">Boniface</hi> 8. grapling and tugging with <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi> the

      like authorities. Christ said of himself, <hi rend="italic">All things are giuen to me of my
       Father, and all power is giuen vnto me in heauen and in earth</hi>. The Deuils said, <hi
       rend="italic">If thou cast vs out, send vs into this herd of swine</hi>. Christ said to his
      Disciples, <hi rend="italic">Yee shall finde the colt of an asse bound, loose it and bring it
       vnto me</hi>. By these places the aduersaries prooue, that Christ disposed of Temporall
      matters; and inferre thereupon, why not Christs Vicar as well as Christ himselfe. The places
      and testimonies now following are very expresse: <hi rend="italic">In stead of thy fathers
       shall be thy children: thou shalt make them Princes through all the earth</hi>.<note
       anchored="true" place="foot">Psal. 45.</note> Item, Iesus Christ not onely commaunded <hi

       shall iudge the Angels ? how much more then the things that pertaine vnto this life</hi> ? A
      little after, <hi rend="italic">Haue not we power to eate</hi> ? These are the chiefe
      passages, on which as vpon maine arches, the roofe of Papall Monarchie, concerning Temporall
      causes, hath rested for three or foure aages past. And yet his Lordship durst not repose any
      confidence in their firme standing to beare vp the said roofe of Temporall Monarchie, for
      feare of making his auditors to burst with laughter. A wise part without question, if his
      Lordship hath not defiled his lips before, with a more ridiculous argument drawne from the
      leprosie and drie scab. </p>
     <p>Let vs now by way of comparison behold Iesus Christ paying tribute vnto <hi rend="italic"
       >Caesar</hi>, and the Pope making <hi rend="italic">Caesar</hi> to pay him tribute: Iesus
      Christ perswading the Iewes to pay tribute vnto an heathen Emperour, and the Pope dispending
      with subiects for their obedience to Christian Emperours: Iesus Christ refusing to arbitrate a
      controuersie of inheritance partable betweene two priuate parties, and the Pope thrusting in
      himselfe without warrant or Commission to bee absolute <pb n="231"/> Iudge in the deposing of
      Kings: Iesus Christ professing that his Kingdome is not of this world, and the Pope
      establishing himselfe in a terrene Empire. In like manner the Apostles forsaking all their
      goods to followe Christ, and the Pope robbing Christians of their goods; the Apostles
      persecuted by Pagan Emperours, and the Pope now setting his foote on the very throate of
      Christian Emperours, then proudly treading Imperiall Crownes vnder his feete. By this
      comparison, the L. Cardinalls allegation of Scripture in fauour of his Master the Pope, is but
      a kind of puppet-play, to make Iesus Christ a mocking stocke, rather then to satisfie his
      auditors with any sound precepts and wholesome instructions. Hereof he seemeth to giue some
      inckling himselfe: For after he hath beene plentifull in citing authorities of Scripture, and
      of newe Doctors, which make for the Popes power to depose Kings; at last he comes in with a
      faire and open confession,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag. 85. </note> that neither by
      diuine Oracles, nor by honourable antiquitie, this controuersie hath beene yet determined: and
      so pulls downe in a word with one hand, the frame of worke that he had built and set vp before
      with an other; discouering withall, the reluctation and priuie checkes of his owne conscience. </p>
     <p>There yet remaineth one obiection, the knot whereof the L. Cardinall in a maner sweateth to
      vntie. His words be these:<note anchored="true" place="foot">Page 84.</note>
      <hi rend="italic">The champions for the negatiue flie to the analogie of other proceedings and
       practises in the Church: They affirme that priuate persons, masters or owners of goods and
       possesions among the common people, are not depriued of their goods for Heresie; and
       consequently that Princes much more should not for the same crime bee depriued of their
       estates</hi>. For answere to this reason, he brings in the defendants of deposition, speaking
      after this maner; <hi rend="italic">In the Kingdome of</hi> France <hi rend="italic">the
       strict execution of lawes decreed in Court against Here- tikes, is fauourably suspended and
       stopped, for the preseruation of peace and publike tranquilitie</hi>. He saith elsewhere; <hi
       rend="italic">Conniuence is vsed towards these Heretikes in regard of their multitude,
       because a notable part of the French Nation and State is made all of Heretikes</hi>. I
      suppose that out of speciall charitie, he would haue those Here- tikes of his owne making,
      forewarned what courteous vse and entreaty they are to expect; when he affirmeth that
      execution of the lawes is but suspended: For indeed suspensions hold but for a time. But in a
      cause of that nature and impor- tance, I dare promise my selfe, that my most honoured brother
      the King of <hi rend="italic">France,</hi> will make vse of other counsell: will rather seeke
      the amitie of his neighbour Princes, and the peace of his Kingdome: will beare in mind the
      great and faithfull seruice of those, who in matter of religion dissent from his Maiestie, as
      of the onely men that haue preserued and saued the Crowne for the King his father, of most
      glorious memorie. I am perswaded my brother of <hi rend="italic">France</hi> wil beleeue, that
      his liege people pretended by the L. Cardinall to bee heretikes, are not halfe so bad as my
      Romane Catholike subiects, who by secret practises vndermine my life, serue a forreine
      Souereigne, are discharged by his Bulls of their obedience due to me their naturall
      Souereigne, are bound (by the maximes and rules published and <pb n="232"/> maintained in
      fauour of the Pope, before this full and famous assemblie of the Estate <hi rend="italic">at
       Paris</hi>; if the said maximes be of any weight and authoritie) to hold meet for no lawfull
      King, are there taught and instructed, that <hi rend="italic">Pauls</hi> commande- ment
      concerning subiection vnto the higher Powers, aduerse to their professed religion, is onely a
      prouisionall precept, framed to the times, and watching for the opportunitie to shake off the
      yoake. All which notwithstanding, I deale with such Romane-Catholikes by the rules and wayes
      of Princely clemencie; their heinous and pernicious error, in effect no lesse then the
      capitall crime of high treason, I vse to call some disease or distemper of the mind. Last of
      all, I beleeue my said brother of <hi rend="italic">France will</hi> set downe in his tables,
      as in record, how little hee standeth ingaged to the L. Cardinall in this behalfe: For those
      of the reformed Religion professe and proclaime, that next vnder God, they owe
      theirpreseruation and safetie to the wisedome and benignity of their Kings. But now comes the
      Cardinall, and he seekes to steale this perswasion out of their hearts: He tells them in open
      Parliament, and without any going about bushes, that all their wel- fare and securitie
      standeth in their multitude, and in the feare which others con- ceiue to trouble the State, by
      the strict execution of lawes against Heretikes. </p>
     <p>He addeth moreouer, that <hi rend="italic">In case a third Sect should peepe out and growe
       vp in</hi> France, <hi rend="italic">the professors thereof should suffer confiscation of
       their goods, with losse of life it selfe; as hath bene practised at</hi> Geneua <hi
       rend="italic">against</hi> Seruetus, <hi rend="italic">and in</hi> England <hi rend="italic"
       >against</hi> Arians. My answer is this, That punishments for heretikes, duely and according
      to Law conuicted, are set downe by decrees of the ciuill Magistrate, bearing rule in the
      countrey where the said heretikes inhabite, and not by any ordinances of the Pope. I say
      withall, the L. Cardinall hath no reason to match and parallell the reformed Churches with <hi
       rend="italic">Seruetus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Arians</hi>: For those heretikes were
      powerfully conuicted by Gods word, and lawfully condemned by the ancient Generall Councils,
      where they were permitted and admitted to plead their owne cause in person. But as for the
      trewth professed by me, and those of the reformed Religion, it was neuer yet hissed out of the
      Schooles, nor cast out of any Council, (like some Parliament bills) where both sides haue bene
      heard with like indifferencie. Yea, what Council soeuer hath bene offered vnto vs in these
      latter times, it hath bene proposed with certaine presuppositions: as, That his Holinesse
      (beeing a partie in the cause, and consequently to come vnder iudge- ment as it were to the
      barre vpon his triall) shall be the Iudge of Assize with Commission of <hi rend="italic"
       >Oyer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Determiner</hi>: it shall been celebrated in a citie of no
      safe accesse, without safe conduct or conuoy to come or goe at pleasure, and without danger:
      it shall be assembled of such persons with free suffrage and voyce, as vphold this rule,
      (which they haue already put in practise <hi rend="italic">against Iohn Hus</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">Hierome</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Prage</hi>) that faith giuen, and oath taken
      to an Heretike, must not be obserued. </p>
     <p>Now then to resume our former matter; If the Pope hitherto hath neuer pre- sumed, for
      pretended heresie to confiscate by sentence, either the lands or the <pb n="233"/> goods of
      priuate persons, or common people of the French Nation, wherefore should hee dare to
      dispossesse Kings of their Royall thrones ? wherefore takes he more vpon him ouer Kings, then
      ouer priuate persons; wherefore shall the sacred heads of Kings be more churlishly, vnciuilly,
      and rigorously handled, then the hoods of the meanest people ? Here the L. Cardinal in stead
      of a direct answer, breakes out of the lists, alledging cleane from the purpose examples of
      heretikes punished, not by the Pope, but by the ciuill Magistrate of the Countrey: But <hi
       rend="italic">Bellarmine</hi> speakes to the point with a more free and open heart: hee is
      absolute and resolute in this opinion, that his Holinesse hath plenary power to dispose all
      Temporall estates and matters in the whole world; <hi rend="italic">I am confident</hi> (saith
       <hi rend="italic">Bellar- mine <note anchored="true" place="foot">Contr. Barclaium, cap.
        27.</note>) and I speake it with assurance, that our Lord</hi> Iesus Christ <hi
       rend="italic">in the dayes of his mortalitie, had power to dispose of all Temporall things
       yea, to strip Souereigne Kings and absolute Lords of their Kingdomes and Seignories: and
       without all doubt hath granted and left euen the same power vnto his Vicar, to make vse
       thereof when- soeuer hee shall thinke it necessary for the saluation of soules</hi>. And so
      his Lordship speaketh without exception of any thing at all: For who doth not know, that <hi
       rend="italic">lesus Christ</hi> had power to dispose no lesse of priuate mens possessions,
      then of whole Realmes and Kingdomes at his pleasure, if it had beene his pleasure to display
      the ensignes of his power ? The same fulnesse of power is likewise in the Pope. In good time:
      belike his Holinesse is the sole heire of Christ, in whole and in part. The last Lateran
      Council <note anchored="true" place="foot">Sess. 9.</note> fineth a Laic that speaketh
      blasphemie, for the first offence (if he be a gentleman) at 25. ducats, and at 50. for the
      second. It presupposeth and taketh it for graunted, that the Church may rifle and ran- sacke
      the purses of priuate men, and cast lots for their goods. The Councill of <hi rend="italic"
       >Trent</hi> diggeth as deepe for the same veine of gold and siluer. It ordaines; <note
       anchored="true" place="foot">Sess. 25. cap. 19. </note>
      <hi rend="italic">That Emperours, Kings, Dukes, Princes, and Lords of cities, castles, and
       territories hold- ing of the Church, in case they shall. assigne any place within their
       limits or liberties for the duell betweene two Christians, shall be depriued of the said
       citie, castle, or place, where such duell shall be performed, they holding the said place of
       the Church by any kind of tenure: that all other Estates held in fee where the like offence
       shall be committed, shall forthwith fall and become forfeited to their immediate and next
       Lords: that all goods, possessions, and estates, as well of the combatants themselues, as of
       their seconds shall bee confiscate</hi>. This Councill doeth necessarily presuppose, it lieth
      in the hand and power of the Church, to dispose of all the lands and estates, held in fee
      throughout all Christendome; (because the Church forsooth can take from one, and giue vnto an
      other all estates held in fee whatsoeuer, as well such as hold of the Church, as of secular
      Lords) and to make ordinances for the confisca- tion of all priuate persons goods. By this
      Canon the Kingdome of <hi rend="italic">Naples</hi> hath need to looke well vnto it selfe. For
      one duell it may fall into the Exchecquer of the Romane Church; because that Kingdome payeth a
      Reliefe to the Church, as a Royaltie or Seignorie that holdeth in fee of the said Church. And
      in <hi rend="italic">France</hi>
      <pb n="234"/> there is not one Lordship, not one Mannor, not one farme which the Pope by this
      meanes cannot shift ouer to a new Lord. His Lordship therefore had carried him- selfe and the
      cause much better, if in stead of seeking such idle shifts, he had by a more large assertion
      maintained the Popes power to dispose of priuate mens possessions, with no lesse right and
      authoritie then of Kingdomes: For what colour of reason can bee giuen, for making the Pope
      Lord of the whole, and not of the parts ? for making him Lord of the forrest in grosse, and
      not of the trees in parcell ? for making him Lord of the whole house, and not of the parlour
      or the dining chamber ? </p>
     <p>His Lordship alleadgeth yet an other reason, but of no better weight: <hi rend="italic"
       >Betweene the power of priuate owners ouer their goods, and the power of Kings ouer their
       estates, there is no little difference: For the goods of priuate persons are ordained for
       their owners, and Princes for the benefit of their Common-wealths</hi>. Heare me now answere.
      If this Cardinal-reason hath any force to inferre, that a King may law- fully be depriued of
      his Kingdome for heresie, but a priuate person cannot for the same crime be turned out of his
      mansion house; then it shall follow by the same reason, that a Father for the same cause may
      bee depriued of all power ouer his children, but a priuate owner cannot be depriued of his
      goods in the like case: because goods are ordeined for the benefit and comfort of their
      owners, but fathers are ordeined for the good and benefit of their children: But most certain
      it is, that Kings representing the image of God in earth and Gods place, haue better and
      closer seate in their chaires of Estate, then any priuate persons haue in the saddle of their
      inheritances and patrimonies, which are dayly seene for sleight causes, to flit and to fall
      into the hands of new Lords: Whereas a Prince being the Head, cannot bee loosed in the proper
      ioynt, not dismounted; like a cannon when the carriage thereof is vnlockt, without a sore
      shaking and a most grieuous disloca- tion of all the members, yea, without subuerting the
      whole bodie of the State, whereby priuate persons without number are inwrapped together in the
      same ruine; euen as the lower shrubs and other brush-wood are crushed in pieces alto- gether
      by the fall of a great oake. But suppose his Lordships reason were some- what ponderous and
      solide withall, yet a King (which would not bee forgotten) is endowed not onely with the
      Kingdome, but also with the ancient Desmenes and Crowne-lands, for which none can be so simple
      to say, The King was ordeined and created King; which neuerthelesse he loseth when hee loseth
      his Crowne. Admit againe this reason were of some pith, to make mighty Kings more easily de-
      poseable then priuate persons from their patrimonies; yet all this makes nothing for the
      deriuing and fetching of deposition from the Popes Consistorie. What hee neuer conferred, by
      what right or power can he claime to take away ? </p>
     <p>But see heere no doubt a sharpe and subtile difference put by the L. Cardinall betweene a
      Kingdome, and the goods of priuate persons. <hi rend="italic">Goods</hi>, as his Lordship
      saith, <hi rend="italic">are without life: they can be constrained by no force, by no example,
       by no inducement of their owners to lose eternall life: Subiects by their Princes may</hi>.
      Now <pb n="235"/> I am of the contrary beliefe, That an hereticall owner, or master of a
      family, hath greater power and meanes withall, to seduce his owne seruants and children, then
      a Prince hath to peruert his own subiects; and yet for the contagion of Heresie, and for
      corrupt religion, children are not remoued from their parents, nor seruants are taken away
      from their masters. Histories abound with examples of most flourishing Churches, vnder a
      Prince of contrary religion. And if things without life or soule are with lesse danger left in
      an heretikes hands; why then shall not an hereticall King with more facilitie and lesse danger
      keepe his Crowne, his Royall charge, his lands, his customes, his imposts, &amp;c ? For will
      any man, except he bee out of his wits, affirme these things to haue any life or soule ? Or
      why shall it bee counted folly to leaue a sword in the hand of a mad Bedlam ? Is not a sword
      also without life and soule ? For my part, I should rather be of this minde; that possession
      of things without reason, is more dangerous and pernicious in the hands of an euill master,
      then the possession of things endued with life and reason: For things without life lacke both
      reason and iudgment, how to exempt and free themselues from being instruments in euill and
      wicked actions, from being emploied to vngodly and abominable vses. I will not deny, that an
      hereti- call Prince is a plague, a pernicious and mortall sickenesse to the soules of his
      subiects: But a breach made by one mischiefe, must not bee filled vp with a greater
      inconuenience: An errour must not be shocked and shouldered with disloialtie, not heresie with
      periurie, not impietie with sedition and armed rebel- lion against GOD and the King. GOD, who
      vseth to try and to schoole his Church, will neuer forsake his Church; nor hath need to
      protect his Church by any pro- ditorious and prodigious practises of perfidious Christians:
      For he makes his Church to be like the burning bush: In the middest of the fire and flames of
      per- secutions, hee will prouide that she shall not be consumed, because hee standeth in the
      midst of his Church. And suppose there may be some iust cause for the French, to play the
      rebels against their King; yet will it not follow, that such rebellious motions are to be
      raised by the bellowes of the Romane Bishop, to whose Pastorall charge and office it is
      nothing proper, to intermeddle in the ciuill affaires of forraine Kingdomes. </p>
     <p>Here is the summe and substance of the L. Cardinals whole discourse, touching his pretence
      of the second inconuenience. Which discourse hee hath closed with a remarkeable confession: to
      wit, that neither by the authoritie of holy Scripture, nor by the the testimonie and verdict
      of the Primitiue Church, there hath bene any full decision of this question. In regard whereof
      he falleth into admiration, that Lay-people haue gone so farre in audaciousnesse, as to labour
      that a doubt- full doctrine might for euer passe currant, and be taken for a new article of
      faith. <hi rend="italic">What a shame, what a reproach is this ? how full of scandall</hi> ?
      for so his Lordship is pleased to cry out. <hi rend="italic">This breakes into the seueralls
       and inclosures of the Churche: this lets in whole herds of heresies to grase in her greene
       and sweet pastures</hi>. On the other side, without any such Rhetoricall outcries, I simply
      affirme: It is a re- <pb n="236"/> proach, a scandall, a crime of rebellion, for a subiect
      hauing his full charge and loade of benefits, in the new spring of his Kings tender aage, his
      King-fathers blood yet reeking, and vpon the point of an addresse for a double match with
      Spaine; in so honourable an assembly, to seeke the thraldome of his Kings Crowne, to play the
      captious in cauilling about causes of his Kings deposing, to giue his former life the Lye with
      shame enough in his old aage, and to make him- selfe a common by-word, vnder the name of a <hi
       rend="italic">Problematicall Martyr</hi>; one that offers himselfe to fagot and fire, for a
      point of doctrine but problematically handled, that is, distrustfully and onely by way of
      doubtfull and questionable dis- course: yea for a point of doctrine, in which the French (as
      he pretendeth) are permitted to thwart and crosse his Holines in iudgement, prouided they
      speake in it as in a point, not certaine and necessary, but onely doubtfull and probable. </p>

    <div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
     <head> THE THIRD INCONVENIENCE EXAMINED.</head>

     <p>THE third Inconuenience pretended by the L. Cardinall<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag.
       87.</note> to grow by admitting this Article of the third Estate, is flourished in these
      colours: <hi rend="italic">It would breed and bring foorth an open and vnauoydeable schisme
       against his Holinesse, and the rest of the whole Ecclesiasticall body: For thereby the
       doctrine long approued and ratified by the Pope and the rest of the Church, should now be
       taxed and condemned of impious and most detestable consequence; yea the Pope and the Church,
       euen in faith and in points of saluation, should be reputed and beleeued to be erroniously
       per- swaded</hi>. Hereupon his Lordship giues himselfe a large scope of the raines, to frame
      his elegant amplifications against schismes and schismatikes. </p>
     <p>Now to mount so high, and to flie in such place vpon the wings of amplifica- tion for this
      Inconuenience, what is it else but magnifically to report and imagine a mischiefe by many
      degrees greater then the mischiefe is ? The L. Cardinal is in a great errour, if hee make
      himselfe beleeue, that other nations wil make a rent or separation from the communion of the
      French, because the French stand to it tooth and naile, that French Crownes are not liable or
      obnoxious to Papall de- position; howsoeuer there is no schisme that importeth not separation
      of com- munion. The most illustrious Republike of <hi rend="italic">Venice</hi>, hath imbarked
      hereselfe in this quarrell against his Holinesse, hath played her prize, and caried away the
      weapons with great honour. Doeth she, notwithstanding her triumph in the cause, forbeare to
      participate with all her neighbours in the same Sacraments ? doeth she liue in schisme with
      all the rest of the Romane Church ? No such matter. When the L. Cardinal himselfe not many
      yeeres past, maintained the Kings cause, and stood honourably for the Kings right against the
      Popes Tem- porall vsurpations, did he then take other Churches to be schismaticall, or the
      rotten members of <hi rend="italic">Antichrist</hi> ? Beleeue it who list, I beleeue my Creed.
      Nay his Lordship telleth vs himselfe a little after, that his Holinesse giues the French <pb
       n="237"/> free scope, to maintaine either the affimatiue or negatiue of this question. And
      will his Holinesse hold them schismatikes, that dissent from his opinion and iudgement in a
      subiect or cause esteemed problematicall ? Farre be it from his Holinesse. The King of Spaine,
      reputed the Popes right arme, neuer gaue the Pope cause by any acte or other declaration, to
      conceiue that he acknowledged himselfe deposeable by the Pope for heresie, or Tyrannie, or
      stupiditie. But being well assured the Pope standeth in greater feare of his arme, then hee
      doeth of the Popes head and shoulders, he neuer troubles his owne head about our question.
      More, when the booke of Cardinall <hi rend="italic">Baronius</hi> was come foorth, in which
      booke the Kingdome of Naples is descried and publiquely discredited (like false money)
      touching the qualitie of a Kingdome, and attributed to the King of Spaine, not as trew
      proprietary thereof, but onely as an Estate held in fee of the Romane Church; the King made no
      bones to condemne and to banish the said booke out of his dominions. The holy Father was
      contented to put vp his Catho- like sonnes proceeding to the Cardinals disgrace, neuer opened
      his mouth against the King, neuer declared or noted the King to be schismaticall. He waits
      perhaps for some fitter opportunitie; when the Kingdome of Spaine groaning vnder the burthens
      of intestine dissentions and troubles, hee may without any danger to himselfe giue the
      Catholike King a Bishops mate. Yea, the L. Cardinal himselfe is better seene in the humors and
      inclinations of the Christian world, then to be grosly perswaded, that in the Kingdome of
      Spaine, and in the very heart of Rome it selfe there be not many, which either make it but a
      ieast, or else take it in fowle scorne, to heare the Popes power ouer the Crownes of Kings
      once named: espe- cially since the Venetian Republic hath put his Holinesse to the worse in
      the same cause, and cast him in Law. </p>
     <p>What needed the L. Cardinall then, by casting vp such mounts and trenches, by heaping one
      amplification vpon an other, to make schisme looke with such a terrible and hideous aspect ?
      Who knowes not how great an offence, how heinous a crime it is to quarter not IESVS CHRISTS
      coat, but his body, which is the Church ? And what needed such terrifying of the Church with
      vglinesse of schisme, whereof there is neither colourable shew, nor possibilitie ? </p>
     <p>The next vgly monster, after schisme, shaped by the L. Cardinall <note anchored="true"
       place="foot">Pag. 89.</note> in the third supposed and pretended inconuenience, is heresie.
      His Lordship saith for the purpose: <hi rend="italic">By this Article we are cast headlong
       into a manifest heresie, as binding vs to confesse, that for many aages past, the Catholike
       Church hath bene banished out of the whole world. For if the champions of the doctrine
       contrary to this Article, doe hold an impious and a detestable opinion, repugnant vnto Gods
       word, then doubtlesse the Pope for so many hundred yeeres expired, hath not bene the head of
       the Church, but an heretike and the Antichrist</hi>. He addeth moreouer; <hi rend="italic"
       >That the Church long agoe hath lost her name of Catholike, and that in France there hath no
       Church flourished, nor so much as appeared these many and more then many yeeres: for as much
       as all</hi>
      <pb n="238"/>
      <hi rend="italic">the French doctors for many yeeres together, haue stood for the contrary
       opinion. We can erect and set vp no trophey more honorable for heretikes in token of their
       victory, then to auow that Christs visible Kingdom is perished from the face of the earth,
       and that for so many hundred yeres that there hath not beene any Temple of God, nor any
       spouse of Christ, but euery where, and all the world ouer, the kingdom of Antichrist, the
       synagogue of Satan, the spouse of the diuel, hath mightily preuailed and borne all the sway.
       Lastly, what stronger engines can these heretikes wish or desire, for the battering and the
       demolishing of transubstantiation, of auricular confession, and other like towers of our
       Catholike Religion, then if it should bee granted the Church hath decided the said points
       without any authoritie ? &amp;c.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>Mee thinkes the L. Cardinal in the whole draught and course of these words doeth seeke not a
      little to blemish the honour of his Church, and to marke his religion with a blacke coale: For
      the whole frame of his Mother-Church is very easie to be shaken, if by the establishing of
      this Article she shall come to finall ruine, and shall become the Synagogue of Satan.
      Likewise, Kings are brought into a very miserable state and condition, if their Souereigntie
      shall not stand, if they shall not bee without danger of deposition, but by the totall ruine
      of the Church, and by holding the Pope, whom they serue, to be Antichrist. The L. Cardinall
      himselfe (let him be well sifted) herein doeth not credit his owne words: For doeth not his
      Lordship tell vs plaine, that neither by Diuine testimony, nor by any sentence of the ancient
      Church, the knot of this controuersie hath bene vntied? againe, that some of the French, by
      the Popes fauourable indulgence, are licensed or tolerated to say their mind, to deliuer their
      opinion of this question, though contrary to the iudgement of his Holinesse; prouided they
      hold it onely as problematicall, and not as necessary ? What ? Can there be any assurance for
      the Pope, that hee is not Antichrist; for the Church of <hi rend="italic">Rome,</hi> that she
      is not a Synagogue of Satan, when a mans assurance is grounded vpon wauering and wilde
      vncertainties, without Canon of Scripture, without consent or countenance of antiquitie, and
      in a cause which the Pope by good leaue suffereth some to tosse with winds of problematicall
      opinion ? It hath beene shewed before, that by Gods word, whereof small reckoning perhaps is
      made, by venerable antiquitie, and by the French Church in those times when the Popes power
      was mounted aloft, the doctrine which teacheth deposing of Kings by the Pope, hath bene
      checked and countermanded. What, did the French in those dayes beleeue the Church was then
      swallowed vp, and no where visible or extant in the world ? No verely; Those that make the
      Pope of Soueraigne authoritie for matters of Faith, are not perswaded that in this cause they
      are bound ab- solutely to beleeue and credit his doctrine. Why so ? Because they take it not
      for any decree or determination of Faith; but for a point perteining to the mys- teries of
      State, and a pillar of the Popes Temporall Monarchie; who hath not receiued any promise from
      God, that in causes of this nature hee shall not erre: For they hold, that errour by no meanes
      can crawle or scramble vp to the Papall <pb n="239"/> See, so highly mounted; but grant
      ambition can scale the highest walls, and climbe the loftiest pinacles of the same See. They
      hold withall, that in case of so speciall aduantage to the Pope, whereby he is made King of
      Kings, and as it were the pay-master or distributer of Crownes, it is against all reason that
      hee should sit as Iudge, to carue out Kingdomes for his owne share. To bee short, let his
      Lordship be assured that he meeteth with notorious blockeheads, more blunt- witted then a
      whetstone, when they are drawne to beleeue by his perswasion, that whosoeuer beleeues the Pope
      hath no right nor power to put Kings beside their Thrones, to giue and take away Crownes, are
      all excluded and barred out of the heauenly Kingdome. </p>
     <p>But now followes a worse matter: For they whom the Cardinall reproachfully calls heretikes,
      haue wrought and wonne his Lordship (as to mee seemeth) to plead their cause at the barre, and
      to betray his owne cause to these heretikes: For what is it in his Lordship, but plaine
      playing the Praeuaricator, when he crieth so lowd, that by admitting and establishing of this
      Article, the doctrine of Cake-incarnation and priuie Confession to a Priest, is vtterly
      subuerted ? Let vs heare his reason, and willingly accept the trewth from his lips. The
      Articles (as his Lordship granteth) of Transubstantiation, auricular Confession, and the Popes
      power to depose Kings, are all grounded alike vpon the same authoritie. Now he hath
      acknowledged the Article of the Popes power to depose Kings, is not decided by the Scripture,
      not by the ancient Church, but within the compasse of certaine aages past, by the authoritie
      of Popes and Councils. Then he goes on well, and inferres with good reason, that in case the
      point of the Popes power be weakened, then the other two points must needs bee shaken, and
      easily ouer- throwen: So that hee doeth confesse the monstrous birth of the breaden-God, and
      the blind Sacrament or vaine fantasie of auricular confession, are no more con- ueyed into the
      Church by pipes from the springs of sacred Scripture, or from the riuers of the ancient
      Church, then that other point of the Popes power ouer Kings and their Crownes. Very good: For
      were they indeed deriued from either of those two heads, that is to say, were they grounded
      vpon the foundation of the first or second authoritie; then they could neuer bee shaken by the
      downefall of the Popes power to depose Kings. I am well assured, that for vsing so good a
      reason, the world will hold his Lordship in suspicion, that he still hath some smacke of his
      fathers discipline and instruction, who in times past had the honour to be a Minister of the
      holy Gospel. </p>
     <p>Howbeit he playeth not faire, nor vseth sincere dealing in his proceeding against such as he
      calls heretikes; when hee casts in their dish, and beares them in hand they frowardly wrangle
      for the inuisibilitie of the Church in earth: For indeed the matter is nothing so. They freely
      acknowledge a visible Church: For howsoeuer the assembly of Gods elect, doth make a body not
      discerneable by mans eye; yet we assuredly beleeue, and gladly professe, there neuer wanted a
      visible Church in the world; yet onely visible to such as make a part of the same. <pb n="240"
      /> All that are without, see no more but men, they doe not see the said men to be the trew
      Church. Wee beleeue moreouer of the vniuersall Church visible, that it is composed of many
      particular Churches, whereof some are better fined and more cleane from lees and dregs then
      other: and withall, we denie the purest Churches to be alwayes the greatest and most visible.

     <head> THE FOVRTH AND LAST INCONVENIENCE EXAMINED.</head>

     <p> THE Lord Cardinall before he looketh into the last Inconuenience, vseth a cer- taine
      preamble of his owne life past, and seruices done to the Kings, <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi>
      the III. and IIII. Touching the latter of which two Kings, his Lordship saith in a straine of
      boasting, after this manner: <hi rend="italic">I, by the grace of God, or the grace of God by
       mee rather, reduced him to the Catholike religion. I obtained at Rome his absolution of Pope
       Clement 8. I reconciled him to the holy See</hi>. Touching the first of these points; I say
      the time, the occasions, and the foresaid Kings necessary affaires doe sufficiently testifie,
      that he was induced to change his mind, and to alter his religion, vpon the strength of other
      manner of arguments then Theological schooles, or the perswasions of the L. Cardinals fluent
      Rhetoricke, doe vsually afford, or could possibly suggest. Moreouer, who doeth not know, that
      in affaires of so high nature and consequence, resolutions once taken, Princes are to pro-
      ceede with instructions by a formal course ? As for the Kings absolution, pre- tended to bee
      purchased of <hi rend="italic">Clement</hi> 8. by the L. Cardinals good seruice; it had beene
      the part of so great a Cardinall, for the honour of his King, of the Realme, and of his owne
      place, to haue buried that piece of his notable seruice in perpetuall silence, and in the
      darke night of eternall obliuion: For in this matter of reconcile- ment, it is not vnknowne to
      the world, how shamefully and basely hee prostituted the inuiolable dignity of his King, when
      his Lordship representing the person of his King, and couching on the ground by way of
      sufficient penance, was glad (as I haue noted in the Preface to my Apologie) to haue his
      venerable shoulders grace- fully saluted with stripes, and reuerently worshipped with
      bastonados of a Ponti- ficiall cudgell. Which gracefull, or disgracefull blemish rather, it
      pleased Pope <hi rend="italic">Clement</hi> of his rare clemencie, to grace yet with a higher
      degree of spirituall graces; in giuing the L. Cardinall then Bishop of <hi rend="italic"
       >Eureux</hi>, a certaine quantity of holy graines, crosses, and medals, or little plates of
      siluer, or some other mettall, to hang about the necke, or to bee borne about against some
      euill: Which treasures of the Popes grace, whosoeuer should graciously and reuerently kisse,
      they should with- out faile purchase vnto themselues a pardon for one hundred yeeres. These
      feate and prety gugawes for children, were nor doubt a speciall comfort vnto the good Kings
      heart, after his Maiestie had beene handsomely basted vpon the L. Bishops backe. But with what
      face can his Lordship brag, that he preuailed with Pope <hi rend="italic">Clement</hi> for the
      Kings absolution ? The late Duke of <hi rend="italic">Neuers</hi>, not long before had
      solicited his Holines, with all earnest and humble instance to the same purpose; <pb n="241"/>
      howsoeuer, the Kings affaires then seeming desperate in the Popes eye, he was licensed to
      depart for <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, without any due and gracious respect vnto his
      errand. But so soone as the Pope receiued intelligence, of the Kings fortunes growing to the
      full, and the affaires of the League to be in the wane, and the prin- cipall cities, the
      strongest places of garrison through all <hi rend="italic">France</hi> to strike tops and tops
      gallant, and to hale the King; then the holy Ghost in good time inspired the holy Father with
      a holy desire and tender affection, to receiue this poore wandring sheep againe into the
      flocke of Christ, and bosome of holy Church. His Holinesse had reason: For he feared by his
      obstinate seuerity to prouoke the patience of the French, and to driue that Nation (as they
      had many times threatned before) then to put in execution their auncient designe; which was,
      to shake off the Pope, and to set vp some of their owne tribes or kinreds for Patriarch ouer
      the French Church. But let his Lordshippe vouchsafe to search the secret of his owne bosome,
      and no doubt he wil not sticke to acknowledge, that before he stirred one foote out of <hi
       rend="italic">France</hi>, he had good assurance of the good successe and issue of his
      honourable embassage. </p>
     <p>Now the hearers thus prepared by his Preface, the L. Cardinall proceedeth in his purpose;
      namely to make proofe, how this Article of the third Estate, wherein doubtfull and
      questionable matters are mingled and confounded with certaine and indubitable principles, doth
      so debilitate and weaken the sinewes and vertue of any remedy intended for the danger of
      Kings, as it maketh all remedies and receipts prescribed for that purpose, to become
      altogether vnprofitable, and with- out effect. He yeelds this reason, (take it forsooth vpon
      my warrant) a reason full of pith and substance: The onely remedie against parricides, is to
      thunder the solemne curses of the Church, and the punishments to be inflicted after death:
      which points, if they be not grounded vpon infallible authoritie, will neuer be setled in mens
      perswasions with any certaine assurance. Now in the solemne curses of the Church, no man can
      attaine to the said assurance, if things not denied be mingled with points not graunted, and
      not consented vnto by the Vniuersall Church. By a thing not denied and not contested, the L.
      Cardinall meanes prohibiting and condemning of King-killing: and by points contested, he
      meanes denying of the Popes power to depose Kings. </p>
     <p>In this whole discourse, I find neither pith of argument, nor course of proofe; but onely a
      cast of the L. Cardinalls office by way of counsell: whereunto I make this answere. If there
      be in this Article of the third Estate any point, wherein all are not of one mind and the same
      iudgement; in whom lieth all the blame, from whence rises the doubt, but from the Popes and
      Popish parasites, by whom the certaintie of the said point hath bin cunningly remooued and
      conueied away, and must be restored againe by publike authority ? Now the way to restore
      certainty vnto a point, which against reason is called into doubt and question, is to make it
      vp in one masse, or to tie it vp in the same bundle, with other certaine points of the same
      nature. <pb n="242"/>
     </p>
     <p>Here I am forced to summon the consciences of men, to make some stand or stay vpon this
      point, and with me to enter into deepe consideration, how great and vnuanquishable force is
      euer found in the trewth: For these two questions, Whether Kings may lawfully be made away by
      assassins waged and hired for the act; and Whether the Pope hath lawfull power to chase Kings
      out of their Thrones, are by the L. Cardinals owne confession, in so full aspect of
      coniunction, that if either bee brought vnder any degree of doubt, the other also is fetcht
      within the same compasse. In which words he directly pointeth as with a finger to the very
      trew source of the maine mischiefe, and to the basilique and liuer veine, infected with
      pestilential blood, inflamed to the destruction of Basilicall Princes by detestable parricide:
      For whosoeuer shall confidently beleeue that Popes are not armed with power to depose Kings;
      will beleeue with no lesse con- fidence and assurance, it is not lawful by sudden assaults to
      flie at their throats. For are not all desperate villaines perswaded, when they are hired to
      murder Kings, that in doing so damnable a feate, they doe it for a piece of notable and
      extraordinary seruice to the Pope ? This maxime therefore is to be held for a principle
      vnmooueable and indubitable; that, If subiects desire the life of their Kings to bee secured;
      they must not yeeld the Pope one inch of power, to depriue their Kings of their Thrones and
      Crownes, by deposing their Kings. </p>
     <p>The Lord Cardinall testifieth no lesse himselfe in these words: <hi rend="italic">If those
       monsters of men, and furies of hell, by whom the life-blood of our two last Kings was let out
       had euer beene acquainted with Lawes Ecclesiasticall, they might haue read them- selues
       adiudged by the Councill of Constance to expresse damnation</hi>. For in these words, the L.
      Cardinall preferreth a bill of inditement to cast his Holinesse; who, vpon the commencing of
      the Leaguers warres, in stead of giuing order for the publishing of the said Ecclesiasticall
      Lawes for the restraining of all parricidicall practises and attempts, fell to the terrour of
      his fulminations, which not long after were seconded and ratified by the most audatious and
      bloody murder of King <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> III. In like manner, the whole Clergy of
       <hi rend="italic">France</hi> are wrapped vp by the L. Cardinals words, and inuolued in the
      perill of the said inditement: For in stead of preaching the said Ecclesiasticall Lawes, by
      which all King-killing is inhibited; the Priests taught, vented, and published nothing but
      rebellion; and when the people in great deuotion came to powre their confessions into the
      Priests eares; then the Priests, with a kind of counterbuffe in the second place when their
      turne was come, and with great deuotion, powred blood into the eares of the people; out of
      which roote grewe the terrour of those cruell warres, and the horrible parricide of that good
      King. </p>
     <p>But let vs here take some neere sight of these Ecclesiasticall Lawes, whereby subiects are
      inhibited to kill, or desperately to dispatch their Kings out of the way. The Lord Cardinall,
      for full payment of all scores vpon this reckoning, layeth downe the credit of the Councill at
       <hi rend="italic">Constance</hi>, which neuerthelesse affoardeth not one myte of trew and
      currant payment. The trewth of the history may bee <pb n="243"/> taken from this briefe
      relation. <hi rend="italic">Iohn</hi> Duke of Burgundy, procured <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi>
      Duke of Orleans to be murthered in Paris: To iustifie and make good this bloody acte, he
      produced a certaine petimaster, one called by the name of <hi rend="italic">Iohn Petit</hi>.
      This little Iohn caused nine propositions to be giuen foorth or set vp, to bee discussed in
      the famous Vniuersitie of Paris: The summe of all to this purpose; It is lawfull, iust, and
      honourable, for euery subiect or priuate person either by open force and violence, or by
      deceit and secret lying in waite, or by some wittie stratagem, or by any other way of fact, to
      kil a Tyrant practising against his King, and other higher powers; yea the King ought in
      reason, to giue him a pension or stipend, that hath killed any person disloyal to his Prince.
      The words of <hi rend="italic">Petits</hi> first pro- position be these:<note anchored="true"
       place="foot">Gerson.</note>
      <hi rend="italic">It is lawfull for euery subiect, without any command or com- mission from
       the higher powers by all the Lawes of nature, of man, and of God him- selfe, to kill or cause
       to be killed any Tyrant, who either by a couetous and greedie desire, or by fraud, by
       diuination vpon casting of Lots, by double and treacherous dealing, doeth plot or practise
       against his Kings corporall health, or the health of his higher powers</hi>. In the third
      proposition: <hi rend="italic">It is lawfull for euery subiect honourable and meritorious, to
       kill the said Tyrant, or cause him to be killed as a Traitor, dis- loyall and trecherous to
       his King</hi>. In the sixt proposition: <hi rend="italic">The King is to appoint a salarie
       and recompence for him that hath kilted such a Tyrant, or hath caused him to bee killed</hi>.
      These propositions of <hi rend="italic">Iohannes Paruus</hi>, were condemned by the Councill
      of Constance, as impious, and tending to the scandall of the Church. Now then, whereas the
      said Councill no doubt vnderstood the name or word Tyrant in the same sense, wherein it was
      taken by <hi rend="italic">Iohannes Paruus</hi>; certaine it is, the Councill was not of any
      such iudgement or mind, to condemne one that should kill a King or Soueraigne Prince; but one
      that by treason, and without commandement should kill a subiect, rebelling and practising
      against his King. For <hi rend="italic">Iohn Petit</hi> had vndertaken to iustifie the making
      away of the Duke of Orleans to be a lawfull acte, and calls that Duke a Tyrant, albeit hee was
      no Soueraigne Prince; as all the aboue recited words of <hi rend="italic">Iohn Petit</hi> doe
      testifie, that he speaketh of such a Tyrant, as being in state of subiection, rebelleth
      against his free and absolute Prince: So that whosoeuer shall narrowly search and looke into
      the mind and meaning of the said Council, shal easily perceiue, that by their decrees the
      safetie of Kings was not confirmed but weakened, not augmented but dimin- ished; for as much
      as they inhibited priuate persons to kill a Subiect, attempting by wicked counsels and
      practises to make away his King. </p>
     <p>But be it granted, the Councill of Constance is flat and altogether direct against
      King-killers; For I am not vnwilling to be perswaded, that had the ques- tion then touched the
      murdering of Soueraigne Princes, the said Councill would haue passed a sound and holy decree:
      But, I say, this granted, what shield of defence is hereby reached to Kings, to ward or beat
      off the thrust of a murderers weapon, and to saue or secure their life ? seeing the L.
      Cardinall, building vpon <pb n="244"/> the subtile deuise and shift of the Iesuites, hath
      taught vs out of their Schooles, that by Kings are vnderstood Kings in <hi rend="italic"
       >esse</hi>, not yet fallen from the supreame de- gree of Soueraigne Royaltie: For being once
      deposed by the Pope, (say the <hi rend="italic">Iesuites</hi>) they are no longer Kings, but
      are fallen from the rights of Soueraigne dignitie; and consequently to make strip and wast of
      their blood, is not forsooth to make strip and wast of Royall blood. The <hi rend="italic"
       >Iesuiticall</hi> masters, in the file of thire words are so supple and so limber, that by
      leauing still in their speech some starting hole or other, they are able by the same, as by a
      posterne or backdoore, to make an escape. </p>
     <p>Meane while the Readers are here to note (for well they may) a tricke of monstrous and most
      wicked cunning. The L. Cardinall contends for the bridling and hampering of King-killers by
      the Lawes Ecclesiasticall. Now it might be presumed, that so reuerend and learned a Cardinal
      intending to make vse of Ecclesiasticall Lawes, by vertue whereof the life of Kings may be
      secured, would fill his mouth and garnish the point with diuine Oracles, that wee might the
      more gladly and willingly giue him the hearing, when hee speakes as one furnished with
      sufficient weight and authoritie of sacred Scripture. But behold, in stead of the authenticall
      and most ancient word, hee propounds the decree of a lateborne Councill at Constance, neither
      for the Popes tooth, nor any way comming neere the point in controuersie. And suppose it were
      pertinent vnto the purpose, the L. Cardinall beareth in his hand a forke of distinction, with
      two tines or teeth to beare off, nay to shift off and to auoid the matter with meere
      dalliance. The shortest and neerest way (in some sort of respects) to establish a false
      opinion, is to charge or set vpon it with false and with ridiculous reasons. The like way to
      worke the ouerthrow of trew doctrine, is to rest or ground it vpon friuolous rea- sons or
      authorities of stubble-weight. For example; if we should thus argue for the immortalitie of
      the soule with <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>:<note anchored="true" place="foot">In
       Phaedone.</note> The swan singeth before her death; <hi rend="italic">ergo</hi>, the soule is
      immortall. Or thus with certaine seduced Christians: The Pope hath ordained the word of God to
      be authenticall: <hi rend="italic">ergo</hi>, all credit must be giuen to diuine Scripture.
      Vpon the spurkies or hookes of such ridiculous argu- ments and friuolous reasons, the L.
      Cardinall hangs the life and safetie of Kings. </p>
     <p>With like artificiall deuises hee pretendeth to haue the infamous murders, and apposted
      cutting of Kings throats in extreame detestation; and yet by deposing them from their Princely
      dignities, by degrading them from their supreame and Soueraigne authorities, hee brings their
      sacred heads to the butchers blocke: For a King deposed by the Pope, (let no man doubt) will
      not leaue any stone vnre- mooued, nor any meanes and wayes vnattempted, nor any forces or
      powers of men vnleuied or vnhired, to defend himselfe and his Regall dignitie, to represse and
      bring vnder his rebellious people, by the Pope discharged of their alleagiance. In this
      perplexitie of the publike affaires, in these tempestuous perturbations of the State, with
      what perils is the King not besieged and assaulted ? His head is <pb n="245"/> exposed to the
      chances of warre; his life a faire marke to the insidious practises of a thousand traitours;
      his Royall person obuious to the dreadfull storme of angry fortune, to the deadly malice, to
      the fatall and mortall weapons of his enemies. The reason: He is presupposed to be lawfully
      and orderly stripped of his Kingdome. Wil he yet hold the sterne of his Royall estate ? Then
      is he necessarily taken for a Tyrant, reputed an vsurper, and his life is exposed to the
      spoile: For the publike lawes make it lawful and free, for any priuate person to enterprise
      against an vsurper of the Kingdome: <hi rend="italic">Euery man</hi>, saith <hi rend="italic"
        >Tertullian,<note anchored="true" place="foot"><foreign xml:lang="lat">In reos Maiestatis,
         publicos hostes omnis homo miles est</foreign>. Tertul. apol. cap. 2.</note> is a souldier,
       to beare armes against all traitors and publike enemies</hi>. Take from a King the title of
      lawfull King, you take from him the warrant of his life, and the weap- ons whereby he is
      maintained in greater securitie, then by his Royall Guard armed with swords and halberds,
      through whose wards and ranks, a desperate villaine will make himselfe an easie passage, being
      master of another mans life, because he is prodigall and carelesse of his owne. Such therefore
      as pretend so much pity towards Kings, to abhorre the bloody opening of their liuer-veine, and
      yet withall, to approoue their hoysting out of the Royall dignity, are iust in the veine and
      humour of those that say, Let vs not kill the King, but let vs disarme the King that he may
      die a violent death: let vs not depriue him of life, but of the meanes to defend his life: let
      vs not strangle the King and stop his vitall breath, so long as he remaineth King; 0 that were
      impious, 0 that were horrible and abominable; but let him be deposed, and then whosoeuer shall
      runne him through the body with a weapon vp to the very hilts, shall not beare the guilt of a
      King-killer. All this must be vnderstood to be spoken of Kings, who after they are despoiled
      of Regalitie, by sentence of deposition giuen by the Pope, are able to arme them- selues, and
      by valiant armes doe defend their Soueraigne rights. But in case the King, blasted with Romane
      lightning, and stricken with Papall thunder, shall actually and speedily bee smitten downe
      from his high Throne of Regality, with present losse of his Kingdome; I beleeue it is almost
      impossible for him to war- rant his owne life, who was not able to warrant his owne Kingdome.
      Let a cat be throwen from a high roofe to the bottom of a cellour or vault, she lighteth on
      her feet, and runneth away without taking any harme. A King is not like a cat, how- soeuer a
      cat may looke vpon a King: he cannot fall from the loftie pinacle of Royalty, to light on his
      feet vpon the hard pauement of a priuate state, without crushing all his bones in pieces. It
      hath bene the lot of very few Emperors and Kings, to outliue their Empire: For men ascend to
      the loftie Throne of Kings, with a soft and easie pace, by certaine steps and degrees; there
      be no stately staires to come downe, they tumble head and heeles together when they fall. He
      that hath once griped anothers Kingdome, thinks himselfe in little safetie, so long as he
      shall of his courtesie suffer his disseised predecessour to draw his breath. And say that some
      Princes, after their fall from their Thrones, haue escaped both point and edge of the Tyrants
      weapon; yet haue they wandred like miserable <pb n="246"/> fugitiues in forreine countreys, or
      else haue bene condemned like captiues to perpetuall imprisonment at home, a thousand-fold
      worse and more lamentable then death it selfe. <hi rend="italic">Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant of
       <hi rend="italic">Syracusa</hi>, from a great King in <hi rend="italic">Sicilie</hi> tur'nd
      Schoolemaster in <hi rend="italic">Corinth</hi>. It was the onely calling and kind of life,
      that as he thought bearing some resemblance of rule and gouernment, might recreate his mind,
      as an image or picture of his former Soueraigntie ouer men. This <hi rend="italic"
       >Dionysius</hi> was the onely man (to my knowledge) that had a humour to laugh after the
      losse of a Kingdome, and in the state of a Pedant or gouernour of children, merily to ieast
      and to scorne his former state and condition of a King. In this my Kingdome of <hi
       rend="italic">England</hi>, sundry Kings haue seene the walls as it were of their Princely
      fortresse dismantled, razed, and beaten downe. By name, <hi rend="italic">Edward</hi> and <hi
       rend="italic">Richard</hi>, both II. and <hi rend="italic">Henrie</hi> the VI. all which
      Kings were most cruelly murdered in prison. In the reigne of <hi rend="italic">Edward</hi>
      III. by Acte of Parliament, <hi rend="italic">Who- soeuer shall imagine</hi>, (that is the
      very word of the Statute) <hi rend="italic">or machinate the Kings death, are declared guiltie
       of Rebellion and high Treason</hi>. The learned Iudges of the Land, grounding vpon this Law
      of <hi rend="italic">Edward</hi> the third, haue euer since reputed and iudged them traitors
      according to Law, that haue dared only to whisper or talke softly betweene the teeth, of
      deposing the King: For they count it a cleare case, that no Crowne can be taken from a Kings
      head, without losse of Head and Crowne together, sooner or later. </p>
     <p>The L. Cardinal<note anchored="true" place="foot">Page 95.</note> therefore in this most
      weightie and serious point doth meerely dally and flowt after a sort, when hee tells vs, <hi
       rend="italic">The Church doeth not inter- meddle with releasing of subiects, and knocking of
       their yrons of obedience, but onely before the Ecclesiasticall tribunall seat; and that
       besides this double censure, of absolu- tion to subiects, and excommunication to the Prince,
       the Church imposeth none other penaltie. Vnder pretence of which two censures, so farre is
       the Church</hi> (as the L. Car- dinall pretendeth) <hi rend="italic">from consenting that any
       man so censured should bee touchedfor his life, that she vtterly abhorreth all murder
       whatsoeuer; but especially all sudden and vnpre- penced murders for feare of casting away
       both body and soule; which often in sudden murders goe both one way</hi>. It hath bene made
      manifest before, that all such pro- scription and setting forth of Kings to port-sale, hath
      alwaies for the traine thereof, either some violent and bloody death, or some other mischiefe
      more intolerable then death it selfe. What are we the better, that parricides of Kings are
      neither set on, nor approued by the Church in their abominable actions; when shee layeth such
      plots, and taketh such courses, as necessarily doe inferre the cutting of their throates ? In
      the next place be it noted, that his Lordship against all reason, reckons the absoluing of
      subiects from the oath of alleagiance, in the ranke of penalties awarded and enioyned before
      the Ecclesiasticall tri- bunall seate: For this penaltie is not Ecclesiasticall, but Ciuill,
      and consequently not triable in Ecclesiasticall Courts, without vsurping vpon the Ciuill
      Magistrate. But I wonder with what face the L. Cardinall can say, The Church neuer con- <pb
       n="247"/> senteth to any practise against his life, whom she hath once chastised with seuere
      censures: For can his Lordship be ignorant, what is written by Pope <hi rend="italic"
        >Vrbanus,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Can. excom. Caus. 23. Quaest. 6.</note> Can.
       Excommunicatorum. Wee take them not in any wise to bee man-slayers, who in a certaine heat of
       zeale towards the Catholike Church their Mother, shall happen to kill an excommunicate
       person</hi>. More, if the Pope doth not approoue and like the practice of King-killing,
      wherefore hath not his Holinesse imposed some seuere censure vpon the booke of <hi
       rend="italic">Mariana</hi> the Iesuite (by whom parricides are com- mended, nay highly
      extolled) when his Holinesse hath beene pleased to take the paines to censure and call in some
      other of <hi rend="italic">Mariana's</hi> bookes ? Againe, wherefore did his Holinesse aduise
      himselfe to censure the Decree of the Court of Parlia- ment in <hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>
      against <hi rend="italic">Iohn Chastell</hi> ? Wherefore did hee suffer <hi rend="italic"
       >Garnet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Old- corne</hi> my powder-miners, both by bookes and
      pictures vendible vnder his nose in <hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, to be inrowled in the Canon
      of holy Martyrs ? And when hee saw two great Kings murdered one after another, wherefore by
      some publike declaration did not his Holinesse testifie to all Christendome, his inward sense
      and trew ap- prehension of so great misfortune, as all <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi> had iust
      cause to lament on the behalfe of <hi rend="italic">France</hi> ? Wherefore did not his
      Holinesse publish some Law or Pon- tificiall Decree, to prouide for the securitie of Kings in
      time to come ? Trew it is, that he censured <hi rend="italic">Becanus</hi> his booke: But
      wherefore ? That by a captious and sleight censure, he might preuent a more exact and rigorous
      Decree of the <hi rend="italic">Sorbone</hi> Schoole: For the Popes checke to <hi
       rend="italic">Becanus</hi>, was onely a generall censure and touch, without any particular
      specification of matter touching the life of Kings. About some two moneths after, the said
      booke was printed againe, with a dedica- tion to the Popes <hi rend="italic">Nuntio</hi> in
       <hi rend="italic">Germany</hi>; yet without any alteration, saue onely of two articles
      conteining the absolute power of the people ouer Kings. In recom- pence and for a
      counterchecke whereof, three or foure articles were inserted into the said booke, touching the
      Popes power ouer Kings; articles no lesse wicked &amp; iniurious to Regall rights; nay more
      iniurious then any of the other clauses, whereof iust cause of exception and complaint had
      bene giuen before. If I would collect and heape vp examples of ancient Emperours, (as of <hi
       rend="italic">Henrie IV</hi>. whose dead corps felt the rage and furie of the Pope; or of <hi
       rend="italic">Frederic</hi> II. against whom the Pope was not ashamed to whet and kindle the
      Sultane; or of Queene <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi> our Predecessour, of glorious memorie,
      whose life was diuers times assaulted by priuie murderers, expresly dispatched from <hi
       rend="italic">Rome</hi> for that holy seruice) if I would gather vp other examples of the
      same stampe, which I haue layd forth in my Apologie for the oath of alleagiance; I could make
      it more cleare then day-light, how farre the L. Cardinals words are discrepant from the
      trewth, where his Lord- ship <note anchored="true" place="foot">Page 97.</note> out of most
      rare confidence is bold to auow, <hi rend="italic">That neuer any Pope went so farre, as to
       giue consent or counsell for the desperate murdering of Princes</hi>. That which already hath
      bene alleadged may suffice to conuince his Lordship: I meane, that his Holinesse by deposing
      of Kings, doeth lead them directly to their graues and tombes. <pb n="248"/>
     </p>
     <p>The Cardinall<note anchored="true" place="foot">Pag. 95.</note> himselfe seemeth to take
      some notice hereof. <hi rend="italic">The Church (as</hi> he speaketh) <hi rend="italic"
       >abborreth sudden and vnprepensed murders aboue the rest</hi>. Doth not his Lordship in this
      phrase of speech acknowledge, that murders committed by open force, are not so much disauowed
      or disclaimed by the Church ? A little after he speakes not in the teeth, as before, but with
      full and open mouth; that hee doeth not dislike a King once deposed by the Pope, should be
      pursued with open warre: Whereupon it followes, that in warre the King may be lawfully slaine.
      No doubt a remarkable degree of his Lordships clemencie. A King shall bee better entreated and
      more mildly dealt withal, if he be slaine by the shot of an harquebuse or caleeuer in the
      field, then if hee bee stabd by the stroke or thrust of a knife in his chamber: or if at a
      siege of some city hee be blowne vp with a myne, then by a myne made, and a traine of
      gunpowder laid vnder his Palace or Parliament house in time of peace. His reason: Forsooth,
      because in sudden murders, oftentimes the soule and the body perish both together. O singular
      bountie, and rare clemencie! prouokers, instigators, strong puffers and blowers of parricides,
      in mercifull compassion of the soule, become vnmercifull and shamefull murderers of the body.
      This deuice may well claime and challenge kinred of <hi rend="italic">Mariana</hi> the <hi
       rend="italic">Iesuites</hi> inuention: For he liketh not at any hand the poisoning of a
      Tyrant by his meat or drinke; for feare lest he taking the poison with his owne hand, and
      swallowing or gulping it downe in his meate or drinke so taken, should be found <hi
       rend="italic">felo de se</hi>, (as the common Lawyer speaketh) or culpable of his owne death.
      But <hi rend="italic">Mariana</hi> likes better, to haue a Tyrant poysoned by his chaire, or
      by his apparell and robes, after the example of the <hi rend="italic">Mauritanian</hi> Kings;
      that being so poysoned onely by sent, or by contact, he may not be found guiltie of selfe-
      fellonie, and the soule of the poore Tyrant in her flight out of the body may be innocent. 0
      hel-hounds, 0 diabolical wretches, 0 infernall monsters! Did they onely suspect and imagine,
      that either in Kings there is any remainder of Kingly courage, or in their subiects any sparke
      left of ancient libertie; they durst as soone eat their nailes, or teare their owne flesh from
      the bones, as once broach the vessell of this diabolicall deuice. How long then, how long
      shall Kings whom the Lord hath called his Anointed, Kings the breathing Images of God vpon
      earth; Kings that with a wry or frowning looke, are able to crush these earth-wormes in
      pieces; how long shall they suffer this viperous brood, scotfree and without punishment, to
      spit in their faces ? how long, the Maiestie of GOD in their person and Royall Maiestie, to be
      so notoriously vilified, so dishonourably trampled vnder foot ? </p>
     <p>The L. Cardinall boards vs with a like manifest ieast, and notably trifles; first,
      distinguishing betweene Tyrants by administration, and Tyrants by vsurpation; then shewing
      that he by no means doeth approue those prophane and heathenish Lawes, whereby secret
      practises and conspiracies against a Tyrant by administra- tion are permitted. His reason; <hi
       rend="italic">Because after deposition there is a certaine habitude</hi>
      <pb n="249"/>
      <hi rend="italic">to Royall dignitie, and as it were a kinde of politicke Character inherent
       in Kings, by which they are discerned from persons meerely private, or the common sort of
       people; and the obstacle, crosse-barre, or sparre once remooued and taken out of the way, the
       said Kings deposed are at length reinuested and endowed againe with lawfull vse of Royall
       dignitie, and with lawfull administration of the Kingdome</hi>. Is it possible that his
      Lordship can speake and vtter these words according to the inward per- swasion of his heart? I
      beleeue it not. For admit a King cast out of his King- dome were sure to escape with life; yet
      being once reduced to a priuate state of life, after hee hath wound or wrought himselfe out of
      deadly danger, so farre he is from holding or retayning any remainder of dignity or politike
      impression, that on the contrary he falleth into greater contempt and misery, then if he had
      bene a very peasant by birth, and had neuer held or gouerned the sterne of Royall estate. What
      fowle is more beautifull then the peacocke? Let her be plumed and bereft of her feathers; what
      owle, what iacke-daw more ridiculous, more without all pleasant fashion ? The homely sowter,
      the infamous catchpol, the base tincker, the rude artificer, the pack-horse porter, then
      liuing in Rome with libertie, when <hi rend="italic">Valentinian</hi> was detain'd captiue by
       <hi rend="italic">Saporas</hi> the Persian King, was more happie then that Romane Emperour.
      And in case the L. Cardinall himselfe should bee so happie (I should say so vnfortunate) to be
      stript of all his dignities and Ecclesiasticall promotions; would it not redound to his
      Lordships wonderfull consolation, that in his greatest extremity, in the lowest of his
      barenesse and nakednesse, he still retaineth a certaine habituall right and character of a
      Car- dinall, whereby to recouer the losse of his former dignities and honours ? when hee
      beholds these prints and impressions of his foresaid honours; would it not make him the more
      willing and glad, to forsake the backe of his venerable mule, to vse his Cardinals foot-cloath
      no longer, but euer after like a Cardinall in print and character, to walke on foot ? </p>
     <p>But let vs examine his Lordships consolation of Kings, thrust out of their kingdomes by the
      Pope for heresie. <hi rend="italic">The obstacle</hi> (as the L. Cardinall speaketh) <hi
       rend="italic">being taken away</hi>; that is to say, when the King shall be reformed; <hi
       rend="italic">this habituall right and character yet inherent in the person of a King,
       restores him to the Lawfull administration of his Kingdome</hi>. I take this to be but a cold
      comfort: For here his Lordship doeth onely presuppose, and not prooue, that after a King is
      thrust out of his Throne, when hee shall repent and turne trew Romane Catholike, the other by
      whom he hath bene cast out, and by force disseised, will recall him to the Royall seat, and
      faithfully settle him againe in his ancient right, as one that reioyceth for the recouery of
      such a lost sheepe. But I should rather feare, the new King would presse and stand vpon other
      termes; as a terme of yeeres for a triall, whether the repentance of the King displaced be
      trew &amp; sound to the coare, or counterfeit, dissembled, and painted holines; for the words,
      the sorrowfull and heauie lookes, the sad and formall gestures, of men pretending repentance,
      are not alwayes to bee taken, to be respected, to be credited. Againe, I should feare <pb
       n="250"/> the afflicted King might be charged and borne downe too, that albeit hee hath
      renounced his former heresie, hee hath stumbled since at an other stone, and runne the ship of
      his faith against some other rocke of new hereticall prauitie. Or I should yet feare, he might
      be made to beleeue that heresie maketh a deeper im- pression, and a character more indeleble
      in the person, then is the other politike character of Regal Maiestie. Alas, good Kings! in
      how hard, in how miserable a state doe they stand ? Once deposed, and euer barred of
      repentance: As if the scapes and errors of Kings, were all sinnes against the Holy Ghost, or
      sinnes vnto death, for which it is not lawfull to pray. Falls a priuate person ? he may be set
      vp, and new established. Falls a King ? is a King deposed ? his repentance is euer fruitlesse,
      euer vnprofitable. Hath a priuate person a traine of seruants ? He can not be depriued of any
      one without his priuitie and consent. Hath a King millions of subiects ? He may be depriued by
      the Pope of a third part, when his Holinesse will haue them turne Clerics or enter Cloisters,
      without asking the King leaue: and so of subiects they may be made non-subiects. </p>
     <p>But I question yet further. A King falling into heresie, is deposed by the Pope, his sonne
      stands pure Catholike: The Regal seat is empty. Who shall suc- ceed in the deposed Kings place
      ? Shall a stranger be preferred by the Pope ? That were to doe the innocent sonne egregious
      and notorious wrong. Shall the sonne himselfe ? That were a more iniurious part in the sonne
      against his father: For if the sonne bee touched with any feare of God, or mooued with any
      reuerence towards his father, hee will diligently and seriously take heed, that hee put not
      his father by the Kingdome by whose meanes he nimselfe is borne to a Kingdome. Nor will hee
      tread in the steps of <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> the V. Emperour, who by the Popes
      instigation, expelled and chased his aaged father out of the Imperiall dignitie. Much lesse
      wil he hearken to the voice and aduise of Doctor <hi rend="italic">Suares</hi>
      <note anchored="true" place="foot">Lib. 6. cap. 4. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Si Papa Regem
        deponat, ab illis tantum poterit, expelli vel interfici, quibus ipse id
        commiserit.</foreign></note> the Iesuite; who, in his booke written against my selfe, a
      booke applauded and approoued of many Doctours, after hee hath like a Doctour of the chaire,
      pronounced, <hi rend="italic">That a King deposed by the Pope, cannot bee lawfully expelled or
       killed, but onely by such as the Pope hath charged with such execution</hi>: falleth to adde
      a little after: <hi rend="italic">If the Pope shall declare a King to bee an heretike, and
       fallen from the Kingdome, without making further declaration touching execution</hi>; that is
      to say, without giuing expresse charge vnto any to make away the King: <hi rend="italic">then
       the lawfull successour being a Catholike, hath power to doe the feate; and if he shall
       refuse, or if there shall be none such, then it appertaineth to the comminaltie or body of
       the Kingdome</hi>. A most detestable sentence: For in hereditarie Kingdomes, who is the Kings
      lawfull suc- cessour, but his sonne ? The sonne then by this doctrine, shall imbrew his hands
      inhis owne fathers blood, so soone as he shall be deposed by the Pope. A matter so much the
      neerer and more deepely to bee apprehended, because the said most outragious booke flyeth like
      a furious mastiffe directly at my throat, and withall <pb n="251"/> instilleth such precepts
      into the tender disposition of my sonne, as if hereafter hee shall become a Romane Catholike,
      so soone as the Pope shall giue me the lift out of my Throne, shall bind him forthwith to make
      effusion of his owne fathers blood. Such is the religion of these reuerend Fathers, the
      pillars of the Pontificiall Monarchie: In comparison of whose religion and holinesse, all the
      impietie that euer was among the Infidels, and all the barbarous crueltie that euer was among
      the Canibals, may passe hencefoorth in the Christian world for pure clemencie and humanitie.
      These things ought his Lordship to haue pondered, rather then to babble of habitudes and
      politike characters, which to the common people are like the Bergamasque or the wilde-Irish
      forme of speach, and passe their vnderstanding. </p>
     <p>All these things are nothing in a maner, if we compare them with the last clause, which is
      the closer, and as it were the vpshot of his Lordships discourse: For therein he laboureth to
      perswade concerning this Article, framed to bridle the Popes tyrannicall power ouer Kings, if
      it should receiue gracious entertainement, and generall approbation; <hi rend="italic">That it
       would breed great danger, and worke effects of pernicious consequence vnto Kings</hi>. The
      reason: <hi rend="italic">because it would prooue an in- troduction to schisme; and schisme
       would stirre vp ciuil warres, contempt of Kings, distempered inclinations and motions to
       intrap their life; and which is worst of all, the fierce wrath of God, inflicting all sorts
       of calamities</hi>. An admirable paradoxe, and able to strike men stone-blind: that his
      Holinesse must haue power to de- pose Kings, for the better security and safegard of their
      life; that when their Crownes are made subiect vnto anothers will and pleasure, then they are
      come to the highest altitude and eleuation of honour; that for the onely-warrant of their
      life, their supreme and absolute greatnesse must be depressed; that for the longer keeping of
      their Crownes, another must plucke the Crowne from their heads. As if it should be said, Would
      they not be stript naked by another ? the best way is, for themselues to vntrusse, for
      themselues to put off all, and to goe naked of their owne accord. Wil they keepe their
      Souereigntie in safetie for euer ? The best way is to let another haue their Soueraigne
      authoritie and supreme Estate in his power. But I haue bene euer of this mind, that when my
      goods are at no mans command or disposing but mine own, then they are trewly and certainly
      mine owne. It may be this error is growen vpon me and other Princes for lacke of braines:
      whereupon it may be feared, or at least coniectured, the Pope meanes to shaue our crownes, and
      thrust vs into some cloister, there to hold ranke in the brotherhood of good King <hi
       rend="italic">Childeric</hi>. Forasmuch then as my dull capacitie doeth not serue mee to
      reach or comprehend the pith of this admirable reason, I haue thought good to seeke and to vse
      the instruction of old and learned experience, which teacheth no such matter: by name, that
      ciuill warres and fearefull per- turbations of State in any nation of the world, haue at any
      time growen from this faithful credulity of subiects, that Popes in right haue no power to
      wrest and lift Kings out of their dignities and possessions. On the other side, by
      establishing <pb n="252"/> the contrary maximes, to yoke and hamper the people with
      Pontificiall tyrannie, what rebellious troubles and stirres, what extreme desolations hath <hi
       rend="italic">England</hi> bene forced to feare and feele, in the Reigne of my Predecessours
       <hi rend="italic">Henrie</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Iohn</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
       >Henrie</hi> III ? These be the maximes and principles, which vnder the Emperour <hi
       rend="italic">Henrie</hi> IV. and <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> the I. made all <hi
       rend="italic">Europe</hi> flowe with channels and streames of blood, like a riuer with water,
      while the Saracens by their incursions and victo- ries ouerflowed, and in a manner drowned the
      honour of the Christian name in the East. These be the maximes and principles, which made way
      for the warres of the last League into <hi rend="italic">France</hi>; by which the very bowels
      of that most famous and flourishing Kingdome were set on such a combustion, that <hi
       rend="italic">France</hi> her selfe was brought within two fingers breadth of bondage to
      another Nation, and the death of her two last Kings most villenously and traiterously
      accomplished. The L. Cardinall then giuing these diabolicall maximes for meanes to secure the
      life and Estate of Kings, speaketh as if he would giue men counsell to dry themselues in the
      riuer, when they come as wet as a water spaniell out of a pond; or to warme themselues by the
      light of the Moone, when they are stark-naked, and well neere frozen to death. </p>

     <head> THE CONCLVSION OF THE LORD OF PERRON EXAMINED.</head>
     <p>AFTER the L. Cardinal hath stoutly shewed the strength of his arme, and the deepe skill of
      his head in fortification; at last he leaues his loftie scaffolds, and falls to worke neerer
      the ground, with more easie tooles of humble praiers and gentle exhortations. The summe of the
      whole is this: <hi rend="italic">He adiures his auditors neuer to forge remedies, neuer so to
       prouide for the temporall safetie of Kings, as thereby to worke their finall falling from
       eternall saluation: neuer to make any rent or rupture in the vnitie of the Church, in this
       corrupt aage infected with pestilent Heresies, which already hauing made so great a breach in
       the walles of</hi> France, <hi rend="italic">will no doubt double their strength by the
       dissentions, diuisions, and schismes of Catholikes. If this infectious plague shall still
       increase and grow to a carbuncle, it can by no meanes poyson Religion, without bringing Kings
       to their winding sheetes and wofull hearses. The first rowlers of that stone of offence,
       aimed at no other marke, then to make an ignominious and lamentable rent in the Church. Hee
       thinks the Deputies of the third Estate, had neither head nor first hand in contriuing this
       Article; but holds it rather a new deuice and subtile inuention, suggested by persons, which
       beeing already cut off by their owne practises from the body of the Romane Church, haue
       likewise inueigled and insnared some that beare the name of Catholiks, with some other
       Ecclesiastics; and vnder afaire pretence and goodly cloake, by name, the seruice of the King,
       haue surprised and played vpon their simplicitie. These men</hi> (as the Cardinall saith) <hi
       rend="italic">doe imitate</hi> Iulian <hi rend="italic">the Apostata, who to bring the
       Christians to idolatrous worship of false gods, commaunded the idols of</hi> Iupiter <hi
       rend="italic">and</hi> Venus <hi rend="italic">to be intermingled with Imperiall statues, and
       other Images of Christian Emperours, &amp;c.</hi>
      <pb n="253"/> Then after certaine Rhetoricall flourishes, his Lordship fals to prosecute his
      former course, and cries out of this Article; <hi rend="italic">A monster hauing the tayle of
       a fish, as if it came cutting the narrow Seas out of</hi> England: <hi rend="italic">For in
       full efect it is downright the</hi> English <hi rend="italic">oath; sauing that indeed the
       oath of</hi> England <hi rend="italic">runneth in a more mild forme, and a more moderate
       straine</hi>. And here he suddenly takes occasion to make some digression: For out of the
      way, and clean from the matter, he entreth into some purpose <hi rend="italic">of my praise
       and commendation</hi>: He courteously forsooth is pleased to grace mee <hi rend="italic">with
       knowledge of learning, and with ciuill vertues</hi>: He seemeth chiefly to reioyce in his
      owne behalfe, and to giue me thanks, <hi rend="italic">that I haue done him the honour to
       enter the lists of Theologicall dispute against hit Lordship</hi>. Howbeit he twitches and
      carpes at me withall, as at one that soweth seeds of dissension and schisme amongst Romane
      Catholiks: And yet he would seeme to qualifie the matter, and to make all whole againe, by
      saying, <hi rend="italic">That in so doing I am perswaded I doe no more then my duetie
       requires. But now</hi> (as his Lordship followes the point) <hi rend="italic">it standeth
       neither with godlinesse, nor with equity, nor with reason, that Acts made, that Statutes,
       Decrees, and Ordinances ratifiedfor the State and Gouernement of</hi> Eng- land, <hi
       rend="italic">should be thrust for binding Laws vpon the Kingdome of</hi> France: <hi
       rend="italic">nor that Catholikes, and much lesse that Ecclesiastics, to the ende they may
       liue in safetie, and freely enioy their priuiledges or immunities in</hi> France, <hi
       rend="italic">should beforced to beleeue, and by oath to seale the same points, which</hi>
      English <hi rend="italic">Catholikes to the end they may pur- chase libertie onely to breath,
       nay sorrowfully to sigh rather, are constrained to allow and to aduow besides. And whereas
       in</hi> England <hi rend="italic">there is no small number of Catho- likes, that lacke not
       constant and resolute minds to endure all sorts of punishment, rather then to take that oath
       of allegiance; will there not be found an other manner of number in</hi> France, <hi
       rend="italic">armed with no lesse constancie and Christian resolution ? There will, most
       honourable Auditors, there will without all doubt: and we all that are of Episcopall dignity
       will sooner suffer Martyrdome in the cause</hi>. Then out of the super-abundance and
      ouer-weight of his Lordships goodnes, he closely coucheth and conuayeth a certaine distastfull
      opposition betweene mee and his King; with praises and thanks to God, that <hi rend="italic"
       >his King is not delighted, &amp; takes no pleasure to make Martyrs.</hi>
     </p>
     <p>All this Artificiall and swelling discourse like vnto puffe-past, if it be viewed at a neere
      distance, will be found like a bladder full of wind, without any soliditie of substantiall
      matter. For the Deputies of the third Estate were neuer so voide of understanding, to beleeue
      that by prouiding for the life and safety of their King, they should thrust him headlong into
      eternall damnation. Their braines were neuer so much blasted, so farre benummed, to dreame the
      soule of their King cannot mount vp to heauen, except he be dismounted from his Princely
      Throne vpon earth, whensoeuer the Pope shall hold vp his finger. </p>
     <p>And whereas he is bold to pronounce, that heretikes of <hi rend="italic">France</hi> doe
      make their benefit and aduantage of this diuision; that speech is grounded vpon this proposi-
      tion; That professors of the Christian Religion reformed (which is to say, purged <pb n="254"
      /> and cleansed of all Popish dregs) are heretikes in fact, and ought so to bee reputed in
      right: Which proposition his Lordship will neuer soundly and sufficiently make good, before
      his Holinesse hath compiled an other Gospell, or hath forged an other Bible at his
      Pontificiall anuile. The L. Cardinall vndertooke to reade mee a lecture vpon that argument;
      but euer since hath played Mum-budget, and hath put himselfe to silence, like one at a
      Non-plus in his enterprise. There be three yeeres already gone and past, since his Lordship
      beganne to shape some answere to a certaine writing dispatched by mee in few daies: With
      forming and reform- ing, with filing and polishing, with labouring and licking his answere
      ouer and ouer againe, with reiterated extractions and calcinations, it may be coniectured that
      all his Lordships labour and cost is long since evaporated and vanished in the aire. Howbeit,
      as well the friendly conference of a King, (for I will not call it a contention) as also the
      dignitie, excellencie, and importance of the matter, long since deserued, and as long since
      required the publishing of some or other an- swere. His Lordships long silence will neuer be
      imputed to lacke of capacity, wherewith who knoweth not how abundantly he is furnished; but
      rather to well aduised agnition of his owne working and building vpon a weake foundation. </p>
     <p>But let vs returne vnto these heretikes, that make so great gaine by the dis- agreement of
      Catholikes. It is no part of their dutie to aime at sowing of dissen- tions; but rather to
      intend and attend their faithfull performance of seruice to their King. If some be pleased,
      and others offended, when so good and loyall duties are sincerely discharged; it is for all
      good subiects to grieue and to be sory, that when they speake for the safetie of their King
      &amp; honour of the trewth, it is their hard hap to leaue any at all vnsatisfied. But suppose
      the said heretiks were the Authors of this article preferred by the third Estate: What need
      they to conceale their names in that regard ? What need they to disclaime the credit of such a
      worthy act ? Would it not redound to their perpetuall honour, to be the onely subiects that
      kept watch ouer the Kings life and Crowne, that stood centinell, and walked the rounds for the
      preseruation of his Princely diademe, when all other had no more touch, no more feeling
      thereof then so many stones ? And what neede the Deputies for the third Estate, to receiue
      instructions from for- raine Kingdomes, concerning a cause of that nature; when there was no
      want of domesticall examples, and the French histories were plentifull in that argu- ment ?
      What neede they to gape for this reformed doctrine, to come swimming with a fishes tayle out
      of an Island to the mayne continent, when they had before their eyes the murders of two Kings,
      with diuerse ciuill warres, and many Arrests of Court, all tending to insinuate and suggest
      the introduction of the same remedy ? Suggestions are needlesse from abroad, when the
      mischiefe is felt at home. It seemes to me that his Lordship in smoothing and tickling the
      Deputies for the third Estate, doth no lesse then wring and wrong their great sufficiencie
      with contumely and outragious abuse; as if they were not furnished with suffi- cient
      foresight, and with loyall affection towards their King, for the preseruation <pb n="255"/> of
      his life and honour, if the remedie were not beaten into their heads by those of the Religion,
      reputed heretikes. </p>
     <p>Touching my selfe, ranged by his Lordship in the same ranke with sowers of dissention; I
      take my God to witnes, and my owne conscience, that I neuer dream'd of any such vnchristian
      proiect. It hath beene hitherto my ordinary course to follow honest counsells, and to walke in
      open waies. I neuer wonted my selfe to holes and corners, to crafty shifts, but euermore to
      plaine and open de- signes. I neede not hide mine intentions for feare of any mortall man,
      that puffeth breath of life out of his nostrils. Nor in any sort doe I purpose, to set <hi
       rend="italic">Iulian</hi> the Apostata before mine eyes, as a patterne for me to follow. <hi
       rend="italic">Iulian</hi> of a Christian became a Pagan: I professe the same faith of Christ
      still, which I haue euer professed: <hi rend="italic">Iulian</hi> went about his designes with
      crafty conueiances; I neuer with any of his captious and cunning sleights: Iulian forced his
      subiects to in- fidelitie against Iesus Christ; I labour to induce my subiects vnto such
      tearmes of loyalty towards my selfe, as Iesus Christ hath prescribed and taught in his word.
      But how farre I differ from <hi rend="italic">Iulian</hi>, it is to be seene more at large in
      my answere to <hi rend="italic">Bellarmines</hi> Epistles written to <hi rend="italic"
       >Blackwell</hi>; from whence the Lord Cardinall borrowing this example, it might well haue
      beseemed his Lordship to borrow likewise my answere from the same place. </p>
     <p>Now as it mooues me nothing at all, to be drawne by his Lordship into suspi- tions of this
      nature and qualitie: so by the prayses, that he rockes me withall, I will neuer be lulled
      asleepe. To commend a man for his knowledge, and withall to take from him the feare of God, is
      to admire a souldier for his goodly head of haire or his curled locks, and withall to call him
      base coward, faint-hearted and fresh-water souldier. Knowledge, wit, and learning in an
      hereticke, are of none other vse and seruice, but only to make him the more culpable, &amp;
      consequently obnoxious to the more grieuous punishments. All vertues turne to vices, when they
      become the seruants of impietie. The hand-maids which the Soueraigne Lady Wisedome calleth to
      be of her traine in the 9. Prouerb. are morall vertues, and humane sciences; which then become
      pernicious, when they run away from their Soueraigne Lady-Mistris, and put ouer themselues in
      seruice to the deuill. What difference is betweene two men, both alike wanting the knowledge
      of God; the one furnished with arts and ciuill vertues, the other brutishly barbarous and of a
      deformed life, or of prophane maners ? What is the difference betweene these two ? I make this
      the onely difference: the first goeth to hell with a better grace, and falleth into perdition
      with more facilitie, then the second: But hee becom- meth exceedingly wicked, euen threefold
      and fourefold abominable, if he wast his treasure and stocke of ciuill vertues in persecuting
      the Church of CHRIST: and if that may be layd in his dish which was cast in <hi rend="italic"
       >Caesars</hi> teeth, that in plaine sobernes and well-setled temper, he attempts the ruine of
      the Common-wealth, which from a drunken sot might receiue perhaps a more easie fall. In
      briefe, I scorne all garlands of praises, which are not euer greene; but being dry and
      withered for <pb n="256"/> want of sap and radicall moysture, doe flagge about barbarous
      Princes browes. I defie and renounce those praises, which fit mee no more then they fit a <hi
       rend="italic">Ma- humetane</hi> King of <hi rend="italic">Marocco</hi>. I contest against all
      praises which grace me with petie accessories, but rob me of the principall, that one thing
      necessary; namely, the feare and knowledge of my GOD: vnto whose Maiestie alone, I haue
      deuoted my Scepter, my sword, my penne, my whole industrie, my whole selfe, with all that is
      mine in whole and in part. I doe it, I doe it in all humble acknowledge- ment of his
      vnspeakable mercie and fauour, who hath vouchsafed to deliuer me from the erroneous way of
      this aage, to deliuer my Kingdome from the Popes tyrannicall yoke, vnder which it hath lyen in
      times past most grieuously op- pressed: My Kingdom where God is now purely serued, and called
      vpon in a tongue which all the vulgar understand: My Kingdome, where the people may now reade
      the Scriptures without any special priuiledge from the Apostolike See, and with no lesse
      libertie then the people of Ephesus, of Rome, and of Corinth did reade the holy Epistles,
      written to their Churches by <hi rend="italic">S. Paul</hi>: My Kingdome, where the people now
      pay no longer any tribute by the poll for Papall indulgences, as they did about an hundred
      yeeres past, and are no longer compelled to the mart, for pardons beyond the Seas and
      mountaines, but haue them now freely offered from God, by the doctrine of the Gospel preached
      at home within their owne seuerall parishes and iurisdictions.<note anchored="true"

      miserable for these causes and the like; let him dreame on, and talke his pleasure: for my
      part I will euer auow, that more worth is our misery then all his felicitie. For the rest, it
      shal by Gods grace be my daily endeauour and serious care, to passe my daies in shaping to my
      selfe such a course of life, that without shamefull calumniating of my person, it shall not
      rest in the tip of any tongue, to touch my life with iust reprehension or blame. Nor am I so
      priuie to mine owne guiltinesse, as to thinke my state so desperate, so deplorable, as Popes
      haue made their owne: For some of them haue bene so open-hearted and so tongue-free, to
      pronounce that Popes themselues, the key- bearers of Heauen and hell, cannot be saued. Two
      Popes, reckoned among the best of the whole bunch or packe, namely, <hi rend="italic"

      <note anchored="true" place="foot">Onup. de vitis Pontif. in vit. Mar. 2. doeth testifie, that

      </note> the II. haue both sung one and the same note; that in their vnderstanding they could
      not conceiue any reason why, or any meanes how those that sway the Popedome can be partakers
      of saluation; But for my particular, grounding my faith vpon the promises of God contained in
      the Gospel, I doe confidently and assuredly beleeue, that repenting me of my sinnes, and
      reposing my whole trust in the merits of IESVS CHRIST, I shall obtaine forgiuenesse of my
      sinnes through his Name. Nor doe I feare, that I am now, or shall be hereafter cast out of the
      Churches lap and bosome; that I now haue or hereafter shall haue no right to the Church as a
       <pb n="257"/> putrified member thereof, so long as I do or shall cleaue to CHRIST IESVS, the
      Head of the Church: the appellation and name whereof, serueth in this corrupt aage, as a
      cloake to couer a thousand new inuentions; and now no longer sig- nifies the assembly of the
      faithfull or such as beleeue in IESVS CHRIST according to his word, but a certaine glorious
      ostentation and temporall Monarchie, whereof the Pope forsooth is the supreame head. </p>
     <p>But if the L. Cardinall by assured and certaine knowledge (as perhaps he may by common fame)
      did vnderstand the horrible conspiracies that haue bin plotted and contriued, not against my
      person and life alone, but also against my whole stocke: if he rightly knew &amp; were inly
      perswaded, of how many fowle periuries &amp; wicked treasons, diuers Ecclesiastical persons
      haue bene lawfully conuicted: in stead of charging me with false imputations, that <hi
       rend="italic">I suffer not my Catholiks to fetch a sigh, or to draw their breath; and that I
       thrust my Catholikes vpon the sharpe edge of punishment in euery kinde</hi>; he would, and
      might well, rather wonder, how I my selfe, after so many dangers run, after so many
      proditorious snares escaped, do yet fetch my owne breath, and yet practise Princely clemencie
      towards the said Catholiks, notorious transgressors of diuine &amp; humane lawes. If the
      French king in the heart of his kingdom, should nourish and foster such a nest of stinging
      hornets and busie wasps, I meane such a pack of subiects, denying his absolute Soueraignty, as
      many Romane Catholiks of my Kingdome do mine: It may wel be doubted, whether the L. Cardinal
      would aduise his king stil to feather the nest of the said Catholiks, stil to keep them warme,
      stil to beare them with an easie and gentle hand: It may wel be doubted, whether his Lordship
      would extol their constancie, that would haue the courage to sheath vp their swords in his
      Kings bowels, or blow vp his King with gun-powder, into the neather station of the lowest
      region: It may wel be doubted, whether he would indure that Orator, who (like as himselfe hath
      done) should stir vp others to suffer Martyrdome after such examples, and to imitate
      parricides &amp; traitors in their constancy. The scope then of the L. Cardinall, in striking
      the sweet strings, and sounding the pleasant notes of praises, which faine he would fil mine
      eares withal; is only by his excellent skil in the musick of Oratory, to bewitch the harts of
      my subiects, to infatuate their minds, to settle them in a resolution to depriue me of my
      life. The reason: Because the plotters and practisers against my life, are honoured and
      rewarded with a glorious name of Martyrs: their constancie (what els?) is admired, when they
      suffer death for treason. Wheras hitherto during the time of my whole raigne to this day, (I
      speake it in the word of a King, and trewth it selfe shall make good the Kings word) no man
      hath lost his life, no man hath in- dured the Racke, no man hath suffered corporall punishment
      in other kinds, meerely or simply, or in any degree of respect, for his conscience in matter
      of religion; but for wicked conspiring against my life, or Estate, or Royall dignitie; or els
      for some notorious crime, or some obstinate and wilfull disobedience: Of which traiterous and
      viperous brood, I commanded one to be hanged by the <pb n="258"/> necke of late in <hi
       rend="italic">Scotland</hi>; a Iesuite of intolerable impudencie, who at his arraign- ment
      and publike triall, stiffely maintained, that I haue robbed the Pope of his right, and haue no
      manner of right in the possession of my Kingdome. His Lordship therefore in offering himselfe
      to Martyrdome, after the rare example of Catholiks, as he saith, suffering all sort of
      punishment in my Kingdome, doeth plainely professe himselfe a follower of traytors and
      parricides. These be the Worthies, these the heroicall spirits, these the honourable Captaines
      and Coronels, whose vertuous parts neuer sufficiently magnified and praysed, his Lordshippe
      propoundeth for imitation to the <hi rend="italic">French</hi> Bishops. O the name of Martyrs,
      in olde times a sacred name! how is it now derided and scoffed ? how is it in these daies
      filthily prophaned ? O you the whole quire and holy company of Apostles, who haue sealed the
      trewth with your dearest blood! how much are you dis- paraged ? how vnfitly are you paragoned
      and matched, when traytors, bloody butchers, and King-killers are made your assistants, and of
      the same <hi rend="italic">Quorum;</hi> or to speake in milder tearmes, when you are coupled
      with Martyrs that suffer for maintaining the Temporall rites of the Popes Empire ? with
      Bishops that offer themselues to a Problematicall Martyrdome, for a point decided neither by
      the authorities of your Spirit-inspired pens, not by the auncient and venerable testimonie of
      the Primitiue Church ? for a point which they dare not vndertake to teach, otherwise then by a
      doubtfull, cold, fearefull way of discourse, and alto- gether without resolution. In good
      sooth, I take the Cardinall for a personage of a quicker spirit and clearer sight, (let his
      Lordship hold mee excused) then to perswade my selfe, that in these matters his tongue and his
      heart, his pen and his inward iudgement, haue any concord or correspondence one with another:
      For beeing very much against his minde (as hee doeth confesse) thrust into the office of an
      Aduocate to pleade this cause; he suffered himselfe to bee carried (after his engagement) with
      some heat, to vtter some things against his conscience, mur- muring and grumbling the contrary
      within; and to affirme some other things with confidence, whereof hee had not beene otherwise
      informed, then onely by vaine and lying report. Of which ranke is that bold assertion of his
      Lordship; That many Catholiks in England, rather then they would subscribe to the oath of
      allegiance in the forme thereof, haue vndergone all sorts of punishment: For in <hi
       rend="italic">England</hi> (as we haue trewly giuen the whole Christian world to vnderstand
      in our Preface to the Apologie) there is but one forme or kind of punishment ordained for all
      sorts of traytors. </p>
     <p>Hath not his Lordship now graced me with goodly testimonialls of prayse and commendation ?
      Am I not by his prayses proclaimed a Tyrant, as it were ine- briated with blood of the Saints,
      and a famous Enginer of torments for my Catho- likes ? To this exhortation for the suffering
      of Martyrdome, in imitation of my English traytors and parricides, if wee shall adde; how
      craftily and subtilly hee makes the Kings of <hi rend="italic">England</hi> to holde of the
      Pope by fealty, and their kingdome in bondage to the Pope by Temporall recognizance, it shall
      easily appeare, that his <pb n="259"/> holy-water of prayses wherewith I am so reuerently
      besprinkled, is a composition extracted out of a dram of hony and a pound of gall, first
      steeped in a strong decoc- tion of bitter wormewood, or of the wild gourd called Coloquintida:
      For after he hath in the beginning of his Oration,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Page.
       10.</note> spoken of Kings that owe fealtie to the Pope and are not Soueraignes in the
      highest degree of Temporall supremacie within their Kingdomes; to explaine his mind and
      meaning the better, he marshals the Kings of <hi rend="italic">England</hi> a little after in
      the same ranke. His words be these; <hi rend="italic">When King</hi> Iohn <hi rend="italic"
       >of</hi> England, <hi rend="italic">not yet bound in any temporall recognizance to the Pope,
       had expelled his Bishops, &amp;c</hi>. His Lordship means, that King <hi rend="italic"
       >Iohn</hi> became so bound to the Pope not long after. And what may this meaning be, but in
      plaine tearmes and broad speach, to call me vsurper and vnlawfull King ? For the feudatarie,
      or he that holdeth a Mannor by fealty, when he doeth not his homage, with all suit and seruice
      that he owes to the Lord <hi rend="italic">Paramount</hi>, doeth fall from the propertie of
      his fee. This reproach of the L. Cardinals, is seconded with an other of <hi rend="italic"
       >Bellar- mines</hi> his brother Cardinall; That <hi rend="italic">Ireland</hi> was giuen to
      the Kings of <hi rend="italic">England</hi> by the Pope. The best is that his most reuerend
      Lordship hath not shewed, who it was that gaue <hi rend="italic">Ireland</hi> to the Pope. </p>
     <p>And touching <hi rend="italic">Iohn</hi> King of <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, thus in
      briefe stands the whole matter. Betweene <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> 2. and the Pope had
      passed sundry bickerments, about collating of Ecclesiasticall dignities. <hi rend="italic"
       >Iohn</hi> the sonne, after his fathers death, reneweth, vndertaketh, and pursueth the same
      quarrell: Driueth certaine <hi rend="italic">English</hi> Bishops out of the Kingdome, for
      defending the Popes insolent vsurpation vpon his Royall prerogatiue, and Regall rights;
      Sheweth such Princely courage and resolu- tion in those times, when all that stood and
      suffered for the Popes Temporall pretensions against Kings, were enrowled Martyrs or
      Confessors. The Pope takes the matter in fowle scorne, and great indignation; shuts the King
      by his excommunicatory Bulls out of the Church; stirres vp his Barons, for other causes the
      Kings heauy friends, to rise in armes; giues the Kingdome of <hi rend="italic">England</hi>
      (like a masterlesse man turned ouer to a new master) to <hi rend="italic">Philippus
       Augustus</hi> King of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>; bindes <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi> to
      make a conquest of <hi rend="italic">England</hi> by the sword, or else no bargaine, or else
      no gift; promises <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi>, in recompence of his trauell and Royall
      expences in that conquest, full absolution and a generall pardon at large for all his sinnes:
      to bee short, cuts King <hi rend="italic">Iohn</hi> out so much worke, and makes him keep so
      many yrons in the fire for his worke, that he had none other way, none other meanes to pacifie
      the Popes high displeasure, to correct or qualifie the malignitie of the Popes cholericke
      humour, by whom he was then so entangled in the Popes toyles, but by yeelding himselfe to
      become the Popes vassal, and his Kingdome feudatary, or to hold by fealty of the Papall See.
      By this meanes his Crowne is made tributary, all his people liable to payment of taxes by the
      poll for a certaine yeerely tribute, and he is blessed with a pardon for all his sinnes.
      Whether King <hi rend="italic">Iohn</hi> was mooued to doe this dishonourable act vpon any
      deuotion, or inflamed <pb n="260"/> with any zeale of Religion; or inforced by the
      vnresistable weapons of necessitie, who can be so blind, that he doeth not well see and
      clearely perceiue ? For to purchase his owne freedome from this bondage to the Pope; what
      could he bee vnwilling to doe, that was willing to bring his Kingdome vnder the yoake of <hi
       rend="italic">Amirales Murmelinus</hi> a Mahumetan Prince, then King of <hi rend="italic"
       >Granado</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Barbaria ?</hi> The Pope after that, sent a Legat into
       <hi rend="italic">England</hi>: The King now the Popes vassall, and holding his Crowne of the
      Pope, like a man that holds his land of another by Knights seruice, or by homage and fealtie,
      doeth faire homage for his Crowne to the Popes Legat, and layeth downe at his feet a great
      masse of the purest gold in coyne. The reuerend Legat, in token of his Masters Soueraigntie,
      with more then vsuall pride falls to kicking and spurning the treasure, no doubt with a paire
      of most holy feet: Not onely so; but likewise at solemne feasts is easily entreated to take
      the Kings chaire of Estate. Heere I would faine know the Lord Cardinals opinion; whether these
      actions of the Pope were iust or vniust, lawfull or vnlaw- full, according to right or against
      all right and reason. If he will say against right; it is then cleare, that against right his
      Lordship hath made way to this example: if according to right, let him then make it knowen,
      from whence or from whom this power was deriued and conueyed to the Pope, whereby hee makes
      himselfe Souereigne Lord of Temporalties in that Kingdome, where neither he nor any of his
      prececessours euer pretended any right, or layd any claime to Temporall matters before. Are
      such prankes to be played by the Pontificiall Bishop ? Is this an act of Holinesse, to set a
      Kingdome on fire by the flaming brands of sedi- tion ? to dismember and quarter a Kingdome
      with intestine warres; onely to this end, that a King once reduced to the lowest degree of
      miserie, might be lifted by his Holinesse out of his Royall prerogatiue, the very soule and
      life of his Royall Estate ? When began this Papall power ? In what aage began the Pope to
      practise this power? What! haue the ancient Canons, (for the Scripture in this question
      beareth no pawme) haue the Canons of the ancient Church imposed any such satisfaction vpon a
      sinner, that of a Souereigne and free King, he should become vassall to his ghostly Father;
      that he should make himselfe together with all his people and subiects tributaries to a
      Bishop, that shall rifle a whole Nation of their coine, that shall receiue homage of a King,
      and make a King his vassall ? What! Shall not a sinner be quitted of his faults, except his
      Pastor turne robber, and one that goeth about to get a booty ? except hee make his Pastour a
      Feoffee in his whole Estate, and suffer himselfe vnder a shadow of penance to freeze naked, to
      be turned out of all his goods and possessions of inheritance ? But be it granted, admit his
      Holinesse robs one Prince of his rights and reuenewes, to con- ferre the same vpon another:
      were it not an high degree of tyrannie to finger another mans estate, and to giue that away to
      a third, which the second hath no right, no lawfull authoritie to giue ? Well, if the Pope
      then shall become his owne caruer in the rights of another; if he shall make his owne coffers
      to swell with anothers reuenewes, if he shall decke and aray his owne backe in the spoiles of
      a <pb n="261"/> sinner, with whom in absolution he maketh peace, and taketh truce; what can
      this be else, but running into further degrees of wickednesse and mischiefe ? what can this be
      else, but heaping of robbery vpon fraud, and impietie vpon rob- bery ? For by such deceitfull,
      craftie, and cunning practises, the nature of the Pontificiall See, meerely spirituall, is
      changed into the Kings-bench-Court, meerely temporall: the Bishops chaire is changed into a
      Monarchs Throne. And not onely so; but besides, the sinners repentance is changed into a snare
      or pit- fall of cousening deceit; and S. <hi rend="italic">Peters</hi> net is changed into a
      casting-net or a flew, to fish for all the wealth of most flourishing Kingdomes. Moreouer, the
      King (a hard case) is driuen by such wiles and subtilities, to worke impossibilities, to acte
      more then is lawfull or within the compasse of his power to practise: For the King neither may
      in right, nor can by power trans-nature his Crowne, impaire the Maiestie of his Kingdome, or
      leaue his Royal dignitie lesse free to his heire apparant, or next successor, then he receiued
      the same of his predecessour: Much lesse, by any dishonourable capitulations, by any vnworthy
      contracts, degrade his posteritie, bring his people vnder the grieuous burden of tributes and
      taxes to a forreine Prince: Least of all, make them tributary to a Priest; vnto whom it on way
      apperteineth to haue any hand in the ciuill affaires of Kings, or to distaine, and vnhallow
      their Crownes. And therefore when the Pope dispatched his <hi rend="italic">Nuntio</hi> to <hi
       rend="italic">Philippus Augustus</hi>, requesting the King to auert <hi rend="italic"
       >Lewis</hi> his sonne from laying any claime to the Kingdome of <hi rend="italic">England;
       Philip</hi> answered the Legat (as we haue it in <hi rend="italic">Matth. Paris;) No King, no
       Prince can alienate or giue away his Kingdom, but by consent of his Barons, bound by Knights
       seruice to defend the said Kingdome: and in case the Pope shall stand for the contrary error,
       his Holiness shall giue to Kingdomes a most pernicious example</hi>. By the same Author it is
      testified, that King <hi rend="italic">Iohn</hi> became odious to his subiects, for such
      dishonourable and vn- worthy inthralling of his Crowne, and Kingdome. Therefore the Popes
      right pretended to the Crowne of <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, which is nothing else but a
      ridiculous vsurpa- tion, hath long agoe vanished into smoake, and required not so much as the
      draw- ing of one sword to snatch and pull it by violence out of his hands: For the Popes power
      lying altogether in a certaine wilde and wandring conceit or opinion of men, and being onely
      an imaginary castle in the ayre, built by pride, and vnderpropped by superstition, is very
      speedily dispersed vpon the first rising and appearing of the trewth in her glorious
      brightnesse. There is none so very a dolt or block- head to deny, that in case this right of
      the Pope ouer <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, is grounded vpon Gods word, then his Holinesse
      may challenge the like right ouer all other King- domes: because all other Kingdomes, Crownes,
      and Scepters are subiect alike to Gods word: For what priuiledge, what charter, what euidence
      can <hi rend="italic">France</hi> fetch out of the Rolles, or any other treasurie of her
      monuments or records, to shew that she oweth lesse subiection to God then <hi rend="italic"
       >England</hi> ? Or was this yoke of bondage then brought vpon the English Nation; was it a
      prerogatiue, whereby they might more easily come to the libertie of the sonnes of God ? Of
      were the people of <pb n="262"/>
      <hi rend="italic">England</hi> perswaded, that for all their substance, wealth, and life
      bestowed on the Pope, his Holinesse by way of exchange returned them better weight and measure
      of spirituall graces ? It is ridiculous, onely to conceiue these toyes in thought; and yet
      with such ridiculous, with such toyes in conceit, his Lordship feeds and entertaines his
      auditors. </p>
     <p>From this point hee falleth to another bowt and fling at his heretikes, with whom he played
      no faire play before:<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Pag. 105.</note>
      <hi rend="italic">There is not one Synode of ministers</hi> (as he saith) <hi rend="italic"
       >which would willingly subscribe to this Article, whereunto wee should bee bound to
       sweare</hi>. But herein his Lordship shooteth farre from the marke. This Article is approoued
      and preached by the Ministers of my Kingdome: It is like- wise preached by those of <hi
       rend="italic">France</hi>, and if need bee (I asssure my selfe) will bee signed by all the
      Ministers of the French Church. </p>
     <p>The L. Cardinall proceedeth, (for hee meaneth not so soone to giue ouer these heretikes:)
       <hi rend="italic">All their Consistories beleeue it as their Creed; that if Catholike Princes
       at any time shall offer force vnto their conscience, then they are dispensed withall for
       their oath of alleagiance. Hence are these modifications and restrictions, tossed so much in
       their mouthes; Prouided the King force vs not in our conscience. Hence are these exceptions
       in the profession of their faith; Prouided the Soueraigne power and authoritie of God, bee
       not in any sort violated or infringed</hi>. In am not able to con- ceiue what engine can bee
      framed of these materialls, for the bearing of Kings out of their eminent seates, by any
      lawfull authoritie or power in the Pope: For say, those of the Religion should be tainted with
      some like errour; how can that be any shelter of excuse for those of the Romish Church, to
      vndermine or to digge vp the Thrones of their Kings ? But in this allegation of the L.
      Cardinall, there is nothing at all, which doeth not iumpe iust and accord to a haire with the
      Article of the third Estate, and with obedience due to the King: For they doe not professe,
      that in case the King shall commaund them to doe any act contrarie to their con- science, they
      would flie at his throat, would make any attempt against his life, would refuse to pay their
      taxations, or to defend him in the warres: They make no profession of deposing the King, or
      discharging the people from the oath of allegiance tendred to the King: which is the very
      point or issue of the matter in controuersie, and the maine mischiefe, against which the third
      Estate hath bin most worthily carefull to prouide a wholesome remedie by this Article. There
      is a world of difference betweene the termes of disobedience, and of deposition. It is one
      thing to disobey the Kings commaund in matters prohibited by diuine lawes, and yet in all
      other matters to performe full subiection vnto the King. It is another thing of a farre higher
      degree or straine of disloyaltie, to bare the King of his Royall robes, throne, and scepter,
      and when he is thus farre disgraced, to degrade him and to put him from his degree and place
      of a King. If the holy Father should charge the L. Cardinal to doe some act repugnant in his
      owne knowledge to the Law of God, I will religiously, and according to the rule of charitie
      pre- <pb n="263"/> sume, that his Lordship in this case would stand out against his Holinesse,
      and notwithstanding would still acknowledge him to be Pope. </p>
     <p>His Lordship yet prosecutes and followes his former purpose: <hi rend="italic">Hence are
       those armes which they haue oftentimes borne against Kings, when Kings practised to take away
       the libertie of their conscience and Religion. Hence are those turbulent Com- motions and
       seditions by them raised, as well in the Low-countryes against the King of Spaine, as in
       Swethland against the Catholike King of Polonia</hi>. Besides, he casteth <hi rend="italic"
       >Iunius Brutus, Buchananus, Barclaius</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Gerson</hi> in our teeth.
      To what end all this ? I see not how it can bee auaileable to authorize the deposing of Kings,
      especially the Popes power to depose. And yet his Lordship here doth outface (by his leaue)
      and beare downe the trewth: For I could neuer yet learne by any good and trew intelligence,
      that in France those of the Religion tooke armes at any time against their King: In the first
      ciuill warres they stood onely vpon their guard: they stood onely to their lawfull wards and
      locks of defence: they armed not, nor tooke the field before they were pursued with fire and
      sword, burnt vp and slaughtred. Besides, Religion was neither the root nor the rynde of those
      intestine troubles. The trew ground of the quarrell was this: During the minority of King <hi
       rend="italic">Francis</hi> II. the Protestants of France were a refuge and succour to the
      Princes of the blood, when they were kept from the Kings presence, and by the ouer powring
      power of their enemies, were no better then plaine driuen and chased from the Court. I meane,
      the Grand-father of the King now raigning, and the Grand-father of the Prince of <hi
       rend="italic">Conde</hi>, when they had no place of safe retreate. In regard of which worthy
      and honourable seruice, it may seeme the French King hath reason to haue the Protestants in
      his gracious remembrance. With other commotion or insurrection, the Protestants are not iustly
      to be charged. But on the contrary, certaine it is that King <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> III.
      raysed and sent forth seuerall armies against the Protestants, to ruine and roote them out of
      the Kingdome: howbeit, so soone as they perceiued the said King was brought into dangerous
      tearms, they ranne with great speed and speciall fidelitie to the Kings rescue and succour, in
      the present danger. Certaine it is, that by their good seruice the said King was deliuered,
      from a most extreame and imminent perill of his life in the city of Tours. Certaine it is,
      they neuer abandoned that <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> 3. nor his next successor <hi
       rend="italic">Henry</hi> 4. in all the heat of reuolts and rebellions, raised in the greatest
      part of the Kingdome by the Pope, and the more part of the Clergie; but stood to the said
      Kings in all their battels, to beare vp the Crowne then tottering and ready to fall. Certaine
      it is, that euen the heads and principalls of those by whom the late King deceased was pursued
      with all extremities, at this day doe enioy the fruit of all the good seruices done to the
      King by the said Protestants: And they are now disgraced, kept vnder, exposed to publike
      hatred. What, for kindling coales of questions and controuersies about Religion ? Forsooth,
      not so; but because if they might haue equall and indifferent dealing, if credit might be
      giuen to their faithfull aduertisements, the Crowne of their Kings should bee no longer <pb
       n="264"/> pinned to the Popes flie-flap; in France there should bee no French exempted from
      subiection to the French King; causes of benefices or of matrimonie, should bee no longer
      citable and summonable to the Romish Court; and the Kingdome should bee no longer tributarie
      vnder the colour of annats, the first fruits of Benefices after the remooue or death of the
      Incumbent, and other like impositions. </p>
     <p>But why doe I speake so much in the behalfe of the French Protestants ? The Lord Cardinall
      himselfe quittes them of this blame, when he telleth vs this doc- trine for the deposing of
      Kings by the Popes mace or verge, had credit and authoritie through all France, vntill <hi
       rend="italic">Caluins</hi> time. Doth not his Lordship vnder- hand confesse by these words,
      that Kings had beene alwaies before <hi rend="italic">Caluins</hi> time, the more dishonoured,
      and the worse serued ? Item, that Protestants, whom his Lordship calls heretikes, by the light
      of holy Scripture made the world then and euer since to see the right of Kings, oppressed so
      long before ? As for those of the Low Countries, and the subiects of Swethland, I haue little
      to say of their case, because it is not within ordinary compasse, and indeed serueth nothing
      to the pur- pose. These Nations, besides the cause of Religion, doe stand vpon certaine
      reasons of State, which I will not here take vpon me like a Iudge to determine or to sift. <hi
       rend="italic">Iunius Brutus</hi>, Whom the Lord Cardinall obiecteth, is an author vnknowne;
      and perhaps of purpose patcht vp by some Romanist, with a wyly deceit to draw the reformed
      Religion into hatred with Christian Princes. <hi rend="italic">Buchanan</hi> I reckon and
      ranke among Poets, not among Diuines, classicall or common. If the man hath burst out here and
      there into some tearmes of excesse, or speach of bad temper; that must be imputed to the
      violence of his humour, and, heate of his spirit, not in any wise to the rules and conclusions
      of trew Religion, rightly by him conceiued before. <hi rend="italic">Barclaius</hi> alledged
      by the Cardinall, meddles not with deposing of Kings; but deals with disavowing them for
      Kings, when they shal renounce the right of Royalty, and of their owne accord giue ouer the
      Kingdome. Now he that leaues it in the Kings choice, either to hold or to giue ouer his
      Crowne, leaues it not in the Popes power to take away the Kingdome. </p>
     <p>Of <hi rend="italic">Gerson</hi> obtruded by the Cardinal, we haue spoken sufficiently
      before, Where it hath beene shewed how <hi rend="italic">Gerson</hi> is disguised, masked, and
      peruerted by his Lordship. In briefe, I take not vpon me to iustifie and make good all the
      say- ings of particular authors: We glory (and well we may) that our religion affordeth no
      rules of rebellion; nor any dispensation to subiects for the oath of their alle- giance; and
      that none of our Churches giue entertainement vnto such monstrous and abhominable principles
      of disloyaltie. </p>
     <p>If any of the French,<note anchored="true" place="foot">Richerius.</note> otherwise
      perswaded in former times, now hauing altered and changed his iudgement, doth contend for the
      Soueraignty of Kings against Papall vsurpation: He doubtles, for winding himselfe out of the
      Laborinth <pb n="265"/> of an error so intricate &amp; pernicious, deserueth great honour and
      speciall praise: He is worthy to hold a place of dignity aboue the L. Cardinall; who hath
      quitted and betrayed his former iudgement, which was holy and iust: Their motions are
      contrary, their markes are opposite: The one reclineth from euill to good, the other declineth
      from good to euill. </p>
     <p>At last his Lordship commeth to the close of his Oration, and bindes vp his whole harangue
      with a feate wreath of praises, proper to his King. He styles the King the eldest Sonne of the
      Church, a young shoot of the lilly, which King Salomon in all his Royaltie was not able to
      match. He leades vs by the hand into the plea- sant meadowes of Histories, there to learne
      vpon the very first sight and view, That so long, so oft as the Kings of France embraced
      vnion, and kept good tearmes of concord with Popes and the Apostolike See; so long as the
      spouse of the Church was pastured and fed among the lillies, all sorts of spirituall and
      temporall graces abundantly showred vpon their Crownes, and vpon their people: On the con-
      trary, when they made any rent or separation from the most holy See; then the lillies were
      pricked and almost choaked with sharpe thornes; they beganne to droope, to stoope, and to
      beare their beautifull heads downe to the very ground, vnder the strong flawes and gusts of
      boystrous windes and tempests. </p>
     <p>My answere to this flourishing close and vpshot, shall be no lesse apert then apt. It
      sauours not of good and faithfull seruice, to smooth and stroake the Kings head with a soft
      hand of oyled speech, and in the meane time to take away the Crowne from his head, and to
      defile it with dirt. But let us try the cause by euidence of Historie, yea by the voice and
      verdict of experience; to see whether the glorious beauty of the French lillies hath beene at
      any time blasted, and thereupon hath faded, by starting aside, and making separation from the
      holy See. Vnder the raigne of King <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi> the Faire, France was blessed
      with peace and prosperity, notwithstanding some outragious acts done against the Papall See,
      and contumelious crying quittance by King <hi rend="italic">Philip</hi> with the Pope. <hi
       rend="italic">Lewis 12.</hi> in ranged battell defeated the armies of Pope <hi rend="italic"
       >ulius</hi> 2. and his Confederates: proclaimed the said Pope to be fallen from the Popedome:
      stamped certaine coynes and pieces of gold with a dishonourable mot, euen to Rome it selfe,
       <hi rend="italic">Rome is Babylon</hi>: yet so much was <hi rend="italic">Lewis</hi> loued
      and honoured of his people, that by a peculiar title he was called, <hi rend="italic">the
       Father of the Country</hi>. Greater blessings of God, greater outward peace and plenty,
      greater inward peace with spirituall and celestiall treasures, were neuer heaped vpon my Great
      Brittaine, then haue beene since my Great Britaine became Great in the greatest and chiefest
      respect of all; to wit, since my Great Brittaine hath shaken off the Popes yoke; since she
      hath refused to receiue and to entertaine the Popes Legats, employed to collect S. <hi
       rend="italic">Peters</hi> tribute or <hi rend="italic">Peter-pence</hi>; since the Kings of
      England, my Great Brittaine, haue not beene the Popes vassals to doe him homage for their
      Crowne, and haue no more felt the lashings, the scourgings of base and beggarly Monkes. Of
      Holland, Ze- land, and Friseland, what neede I speake ? yet a word and no more. Were they <pb
       n="266"/> not a kinde of naked and bare people, of small value, before God lighted the torch
      of the Gospel, and aduanced it in those Nations ? were they not an ill fedde and scragged
      people, in comparison of the inestimable wealth and prosperity (both in all military actions
      and mechanicall trades, in trafficke as merchants, in marting as men of warre, in long
      nauigation for discouerie) to which they are now raysed and mounted by the mercifull blessing
      of God, since the darknes of Poperie hath beene scattered, and the bright Sunne of the Gospel
      hath shined in those Coun- tryes ? Behold the Venetian Republique: Hath shee now lesse
      beautie, lesse glory, lesse peace and prosperitie, since she lately fell to bicker and contend
      with the Pope ? since she hath wrung out of the Popes hand, the one of his two swords ? since
      she hath plumed and shaked his Temporall dominion ? On the contrarie; after the French Kings
      had honoured the Popes, with munificent graunts and gifts of all the cities and territories,
      lands and possessions, which they now hold in Italy, and the auncient Earledome of <hi
       rend="italic">Auignon</hi> in France for an ouer- plus; were they not rudely recompenced, and
      homely handled by their most ingratefull fee-farmers and copy-holders ? Haue not Popes forged
      a donation of <hi rend="italic">Constantine</hi>, of purpose to blot out all memory of <hi
       rend="italic">Pepins</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Charlemaignes</hi> dona- tion ? Haue they not
      vexed and troubled the State ? haue they not whetted the sonnes of <hi rend="italic"
       >Lewis</hi> the Courteous against their owne Father, whose life was a pat- terne and example
      of innocencie ? Haue they not by their infinite exactions, robbed and scoured the Kingdome of
      all their treasure ? Were not the Kings of France, driuen to stoppe their violent courses by
      the pragmaticall sanction ? Did they not sundry times interdict the Kingdome, degrade the
      Kings, solicite the neighbour-Princes to inuade and lay hold on the Kingdome, and stirre vp
      the people against the King, whereby a gate was opened to a world of troubles and parricides ?
      Did not <hi rend="italic">Rauaillac</hi> render this reason for his monstrous and horrible
      attempt, That King <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> had a designe to warre with God, because he
      had a designe to take armes against his Holinesse, who is God ? This makes me to wonder, what
      mooued the L. Cardinall to marshall the last ciuill warres and motions in <hi rend="italic"
       >France</hi>, in the ranke of examples of vnhappy separation from the Pope, when the Pope
      himselfe was the trumpetor of the same troublesome motions. If the Pope had bene wronged and
      offended by the French King, or his people, and the Kingdome of <hi rend="italic">France</hi>
      had been scourged with pestilence, or famine, or some other calamitie by forraine enemies; it
      might haue beene taken in probabililtie, as a vengeance of God for some iniurie done vnto his
      Vicar: But his Holiness being the roote, the ground, the master-workeman and artificer of all
      these mis- chiefes; how can it be said, that God punisheth any iniurie done to the Pope? but
      rather that his Holinesse doth reuenge his owne quarrell; and which is worst of all, when his
      Holinesse hath no iust cause of quarrell or offence. Now then; to exhort a Nation (as the L.
      Cardinall hath done) by the remembrance of former calamities, to curry fauour with the Pope,
      and to hold a strict vnison with his Holi- nesse, is no exhortation to beare the Pope any
      respect of loue, or of reuerence, but <pb n="267"/> rather a rubbing of memory, and a calling
      to minde of those grieuous calamities, whereof the Pope hath been the only occasion. It is
      also a threatning and obtrud- ing of the Popes terrible thunder-bolts, which neuer scorched
      nor parched any skinne, (except crauens and meticulous bodies) and haue brought many great
      showres of blessings vpon my Kingdome. </p>
     <p>As for <hi rend="italic">France</hi>, if she hath enioyed prosperity in the times of her
      good agree- ment with Popes, it is because the Pope seekes the amity of Princes that are in
      prosperitie, haue the meanes to curbe his pretensions, and to put him to some plunge. Kings
      are not in prosperity, because the Pope holds amitie with Kings; but his Holinesse vseth all
      deuises, &amp; seeketh all meanes to haue amitie with Kings, because he sees them flourish
      &amp; sayle with prosperous winds. The swallow is no cause, but a companion of the spring: the
      Pope is no worker of a Kingdoms felicity, but a wooer of kings when they sit in felicities
      lap: he is no founder, but a follower of their good fortunes. On the other side: let a
      Kingdome fall into some grieuous disaster or calamitie, let ciuill warres boile in the bowels
      of the King- dome; ciuill wars no lesse dangerous to the State, then fearefull and grieuous to
      the people; who riseth sooner then the Pope, who rusheth sooner into the troubled streames
      then the Pope, who thrusteth himselfe sooner into the heate of the quarrell then the Pope, who
      runneth sooner to raise his gaine by the publike wrack then the Pope, and all vnder colour of
      a heart wounded and bleeding for the saluation of soules ? If the lawfull King happen to be
      foyled, to be oppressed, and thereupon the State by his fall to get a new master by the Popes
      practise; then the said new master must hold the Kingdome as of the Popes free gift, and rule
      or guide the sterne of the State at his becke, and by his instruction. If the first and right
      Lord, in despite of all the Popes fulminations and fire-workes, shall get the honourable day,
      and vpper hand of his enemies; then the holy Father with a cheerfull and pleasant grace, yea
      with fatherly gratulation, opens the rich cabinet of his iewells, I meane the treasurie of his
      indulgences, and falls now to dandle and cocker the King in his fatherly lap, whose throat if
      he could, he would haue cut not long before. </p>
     <p>This pestilent mischiefe hath now a long time taken roote, and is growne to a great head in
      the Christian world, through the secret, but iust iudgement of God; by whom Christian Kings
      haue beene smitten with a spirit of dizzinesse: Chris- tian Kings, who for many aages past
      haue liued in ignorance, without any sound instruction, without any trew sense and right
      feeling of their owne right and power, whilest vnder a shadow of Religion and false cloake of
      pietie, their King- domes haue beene ouer-burdened, yea ouer-borne with tributes, and their
      Crownes made to stoope euen to miserable bondage. That God in whose hand the hearts of Kings
      are poised, and at his pleasure turned as the water-courses; that mighty God alone, in his
      good time, is able to rouze them out of so deepe a slumber, and to take order (their drowzy
      fits once ouer and shaken off with heroicall spirits) that Popes hereafter shall play no more
      vpon their patience, nor presume to put <pb n="268"/> bits and snaffles in their noble
      mouthes, to the binding vp of their power with weake scruples, like mighty buls lead about by
      litle children with a small twisted thred. To that God, that King of Kings I deuote my
      scepter; at his feet in all humblenes I lay downe my Crowne; to his holy decrees and commaunds
      I will euer be a faithfull seruant, and in his battels a faithfull champion. To conclude; in
      this iust cause and quarrell, I dare send the challenge, and will require no second, to
      maintaine as a defendant of honour, that my brother-Princes and my selfe, whom God hath
      aduanced vpon the Throne of Soueraigne Maiestie and supreame dignity, doe hold the Royall
      dignitie of his Maiestie alone; to whose seruice, as a most humble homager and vassall, I
      consecrate all the glory, honour, splendor, and lustre of my earthly Kingdomes. <pb n="269"/>
