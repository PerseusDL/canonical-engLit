				<p part="N">SOCRATES (good reader) being demanded how a man might speake that which should be
					best and acceptable to all men, most wiselie (as one in all his life wholie
					giuen to serch and saie the truth in euerie thing) answered: That we then speake
					best &amp; most to be allowed, when we speake nothing but that which we best and
					perfectlie know. For we know nothing excellentlie well, but such things as are
					often heard by vs from others, manie times repeated by our selues; and that
					which is commonlie receiued, imbraced, approoued, and vsed by all men. Now those
					things are most vsed which concerne publike affaires, and such publike affaires
					are most knowne when they end in publike action; &amp; publike action, so farre
					foorth as it concerneth the thing doone, must needs be true that the same was so
					doone in that order, as it was openlie sene to be doone. Wherby might be
					concluded, that in chronicling and treating of publike affaires, we should
					speake that which is best, which is most acceptable, &amp; most true: bicause we
					report things doone in the eies of all men. But how trulie that is performed in
					some new writers, it is well knowne to all men of iudgement. For such is the
					affection of our age, that some of malice, and some for flatterie, and euerie
					one to feed their owne disposition, doo so glose things publiklie doone, as with
					a certeine witcherie of words, they like Circes transforme the things doone in
					publike shew to be of other shapes than they were indeed. Whereby Socrates maie
					now seeme to be confuted, in saieng, that they speake best that speake things
					receiued of all men, and that be common to the world: for so shall misreporting
					and flatterie, a thing commonlie knowne and vsed of all men, be the best speech;
					which in truth neither is nor can be. Now what I haue seene and knowe in that,
					as well of things at home as of things abroad, I forbeare to write; and for that
					cause also might most iustlie restraine my pen (writing vpon the report of
					others) both now and hereafter from treating of such publike affaires, to the
					end my selfe should not run into the danger of a like falsifier or misreporter.
					But then on the contrarie part, when I fall to an other exposition of the same
					saieng of Socrates, that he speaketh best, that speaketh that which he best
					knoweth, and that we best know the things which are commonlie receiued, and that
					we receiue those <!--<fw place="bot-right">"for"</fw>-->
					<pb n="656"/>
					<!--<fw place="top-left">"656"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE PREFACE."</fw>-->
					for soundest which time trieth to be most true, and those things which be most
					true are such as are knowne to be publikelie doone; I suppose I shall speake
					best and most acceptablie in writing publike affaires; considering that I am not
					sworne to anie faction, nor carried with hate or loue, nor bewitched with
					promise of gaine or honour, nor inforced to turne to the right or left hand, but
					onelie left at libertie to make truth the daughter of time to be the common end,
					knowledge, and report of publike things: sith the end of labor, of contemplation
					of studie, &amp; fruit of writing (as appeareth 2. Met. 4.) is the atteining of
					truth, and not that perpetuitie or memorie of a famous name or report, a thing
					alwaies sought by me to be auoided, being onelie content in secrecie to relie my
					selfe vpon the recording of truth, which of all things (in my mind) is most
					pleasant, bicause the same is alwaie a conqueror. For as saith Nehemias, Truth
					is great and dooth mightilie preuaile. Wherefore, as I said, sith those things
					be most true &amp; best knowne which are publikelie doone, and that they are
					publikelie doone that sort to anie action in the common-welth: we then conclude
					that we write best and most acceptablie, when we trulie set downe a common truth
					of common occurrents doone in the common-wealth; bicause that such things trulie
					reported, doo conclude with Socrates that we speake and write best in declaring
					a deed trulie doone, in that order (without ambages, gloses, or parcialities) as
					the same was most trulie performed touching the truth of that outward act.</p>
				<p part="N">Accept therfore (good reader) that which I doo suppose I haue best spoken (by
					this my argument grounded vpon Socrates) in this my continuance of the Annales
					of Scotland vnwillinglie attempted, but by inforcement of others, whose
					commanding friendship it had beene sacrilege for me to haue gainesaid. And
					therefore rather carelesse to hazard the hard opinion of others, descanting vpon
					my sudden leaping into the printers shop (especiallie at the first in a matter
					of such importance) than the losse of the long and assured friendship of those
					which laied this heauie charge vpon my weake shoulders, I haue like blind bairad
					boldlie run into this matter, vnder the hope of thy fauourable acceptance. And
					though herein I shall not in euerie respect satisfie all mens minds and
					iudgements, that for fauour of persons, times, &amp; actions, will like Proteus
					at their owne pleasure make black seeme white, alter euerie matter into euerie
					shape, &amp; curiouslie carping at my barrennes in writing, bicause I omit manie
					things in this my continuance of the Annales of Scotland, &amp; haue reported
					things in other formes than some mens humors would haue had me to doo: I must
					desire thee to consider for the first that the Scots themselues, beside manie
					others of our owne nation are the cause thereof, who either for feare durst not,
					or for pretended aduise and consultation in the matter would not, or for the
					restreint of others might not, impart to me such things as should both concerne
					the honour of the Scotish nation, and the substance of their owne cause. For the
					other matter, if I should bind my stile to the affections of some. I should
					breake the rule of Socrates, and not speake the best, sith I should then speake
					publike and common things, publikelie knowne to all men, contrarie to that
					order, in which they were commonlie and publikelie seene to be doone of all men;
					and so by that meanes fall into the reproch of a disdeined reporter.</p>
				<p part="N">Now, if thou which art the reader, thinke that I (vnacquainted with matters of
					state, especiallie in an other countrie, better knowne to all men than to my
					selfe) am far vnable to <!--<fw place="bot-right">"breake"</fw>-->
					<pb n="657"/>
					<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE PREFACE."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"657"</fw>-->
					breake the dangerous ice of such matters, and so more vnmeet to enter into the
					bosome of princes (whose harts as Salomon saith are vnsearchable) should for my
					vnaduisednesse seeme worthie the punishment of Prometheus, that stale the fier
					from Iupiter, and caried it abrode into the world, bicause the affaires of
					princes are not to be made common, to be submitted to the censure of their
					subiects, nor to be written vntill the ashes of all those whome the things
					concerne were vtterlie consumed: thou must yet remember that men haue escaped
					punishment in dealing with higher matters than with things of chronicles, or of
					such like which onelie touch the life of the bodie. And therefore in punishing
					thereof vpon Prometheus, Iupiter went beyond himselfe. For if the greater, that
					is for matters touching the soule, went not onelie free from punishment, but
					receiued eternall reward, as after shall appeare, how much more should
					Prometheus haue beene spared, that but onelie medled with the bodie? Now it is
					manifest that in diuinitie and matters of the soule (a thing that so far
					excéedeth the bodie as the sunne dooth the moone, as angels doo inferior
					creatures, and as light dooth darkenesse) there be manie which haue lept into
					heauen, and by contemplation placed their pen amongst the sonnes of God in
					writing, and laieng abrode to the world (as much as in them laie) the
					vnsearchable works of the Almightie, whereof we cannot comprehend the least
					cause, order or perfection, and haue therefore not onelie not receiued
					punishment, but eternall reward both in bodie and soule; as Enoch was translated
					to paradise; Elias taken vp in a fierie chariot; Paule rapt vp into the third
					heauen, with manie others. For which cause I saie, if they which lepped into
					matters farre beyond the reach of men, to expresse in the meanest degree of
					perfection, were not punished for medling therein, and writing thereof; much
					lesse ought I to be punished with Prometheus in medling with the discourse of
					matters vpon the earth, and such as concerne the actions of mortall creatures,
					as battels, mutations of kingdoms, death of princes, and such other earthlie
					accidents. Into which yet I would not haue so rashlie descended, or taken so
					hard a prouince in hand, had not (as before I said) the commandement of such as
					I durst not gainsaie, interponed it selfe as a shield to receiue and beat backe
					the sharpe darts of enuious toongs. For which cause sith I was bound to him by
					desart, and that he had better opinion of me than there was cause whie; I feared
					not (though I deemed it the part of him which doubted the iudgement and reproch
					of the wiser sort, not to haue hazarded his credit) to enter into this dangerous
					sea, being not so much furnished with hope to performe it well, as desirous to
					discharge the request of him, and to shew the hope I conceiued at the well
					acceptance thereof by thee. In which discourse I had rather good reader thou
					shouldest complaine of want of sufficiencie in me to performe so hard a thing:
					than that he should mislike of my goodwill in answering his desire. And should I
					feare to enter heereinto, being a thing meet onelie for great councellors and
					men priuie of matters of estate; as though there were no place for Greeke poets
					but onelie to Homer and Sophocles; and for Latine poets, but to Virgill, Ouid,
					and Horace? Did the singularitie and amplenesse of Platos knowledge in
					philosophie feare Aristotle to write in the like argument? Or hath Aristotle
					staied the pen of others? Shall no man be painters but Appelles or Zeuxis, or
					caruers or grauers but Phidias and Lysias? Shall no man be orators but Cicero,
					Quintilian, and <!--<fw place="bot-left">"VOL. V."</fw>--><!--<fw place="bot-center">"4 P"</fw>--><!--<fw place="bot-right">"thenes"</fw>-->
					<pb n="658"/>
					<!--<fw place="top-left">"658"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE PREFACE."</fw>-->
					Demosthenes? Shall none write histories but Cæsar, Liuie, Sabellicus, Paulus
					Iouius, Comineus, Guicciardine, or such like? Or shall none deliuer their
					trauell to the world bicause they cannot write in English as did sir Thomas
					Moore, sir Iohn Cheeke, Roger Askam, Gefferie Fenton, or Iohn Lilie? Yes trulie,
					for when they haue doone their best, and written what they can, a man may yet
					imagine a far more excellent thing, euen of and in that wherein they haue best
					trauelled, written, painted, or graued, and that euen by the selfe same thing
					which they haue doone. And more good reader thou canst not doo either vpon the
					basenes of my stile, the disorder of the matter, or the barrennesse of supplieng
					of things requisit for the furnishing and maiestie of an historie, than to
					suppose and saie that a better forme and method of writing, a more ample
					discourse for the matter, and a sweeter stile for the manner might haue beene
					had for the historie of Scotland, than that which I haue set downe. Wherefore if
					the best writers be subiect to these faults, that when they haue spent all their
					wit, eloquence, and art, there is yet somewhat to be desired in them, as well as
					in me the meanest writer, I am content to beare all speeches, and desire thee to
					thinke what I would doo, and not what I should doo; to excuse me by others, and
					not to condemne me with others; to accept this in that sort as I haue meant it,
					and rather with mildnesse to pardon my imperfections, than with malice to barke
					at my well meaning. Besides which, if thou shalt deeme this worke and
					continuation of mine for Scotland, ought to haue been consecrated to the
					fauourable acceptance, and honourable protection of him to whom the first volume
					was dedicated; I answer (besides that I am to him an estranger, and not to beg
					vndeserued fauour of anie person, and that the first patrone of this Scotish
					historie is now in the low countries beyond the seas) this is a thing by me so
					slenderlie doone, that it meriteth not his honourable iudgement, or the learned
					view or patronage of anie other of the nobilitie. For if it had, I would then
					haue bestowed the same vpon those to whom I haue alreadie consecrated my selfe,
					whatsoeuer I am, hauing long before this couenanted with my bodie, onelie to tie
					it vnto their good commandement. For hauing but one heart, I cannot dilate it to
					serue and offer it selfe to manie persons, considering that where is but one
					heart, there must needs be but one waie: and he that will bestowe one heart vpon
					manie persons, must diuide the same into manie portions, and so dismember it,
					that in the end it will be no heart at all; or els he must go to the shambles to
					prouide manie sheepes hearts, to bestow vpon those manie to whom he will bind
					his manie seruices: for which causes I may neither choose a new patrone, nor
					dedicate this to the old, but onelie to thee the fauourable reader. Now before I
					knit vp this exordium (which may seeme to thee in respect of the following
					historie, to be like the towne, the gates and entrance whereinto being verie
					great, occasioned Diogenes to will the inhabitants to shut those great gates,
					least that little towne did run out thereat) I am to admonish thee good reader,
					that in all my former additions to the historie of Scotland, I haue neither word
					for word, nor sentence for sentence, set downe the writings of Lesleus or
					Buchanan, but haue chosen out the matter as I thought best and apt to my desire.
					After which sort I haue likewise in this my continuation of the annales of that
					countrie, not set downe or deliuered things to the world in that sort and stile
					as I haue receiued <!--<fw place="bot-right">"telligence"</fw>-->

					<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE PREFACE."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"659"</fw>-->
					intelligence thereof, but onelie culled foorth such matter as both the time
					wherein we liue, the matter whereof I intreat, and the method required
					therefore, may well beare and chalenge. Thus hauing laid before thee, that he
					writeth best that trulie writeth publike affaires, that I was commanded by my
					deere freends to enter into this sand: that I cannot discourse of this historie
					as I willinglie would: that I ought not to forbeare to write bicause I cannot in
					stile and matter equall the best: that they are to be pardoned that attempt high
					things: that I haue purposelie in generall dedicated this labour to the common
					reader, and not in particular to anie honourable person: and hoping that thou
					wilt pardon all imperfections, I sparinglie enter into the continuation of the
					annales of Scotland (being such as thou maist be content to read, and I am
					contented to write) in this sort as heere followeth, making my first entrance
					thereinto with the death of the earle of Lennox, with whome Holinshed finished
					his chronicle, and so to the matter, after this long and tedious deteining of
					thee from the same.</p>

					<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Buchan. lib.</emph> 20.</note> troblsome time wold so
					permit) the noblemen which were there present of that faction, taking part with
					the king, assembled themselues for the creating of a new regent, to which
					function they named thrée, and those first by oth compelled to yeeld to the
					voices of the nobilitie. The thrée appointed by them were Gilspec Cambell earle
					of Argile, Iames <note place="marg" anchored="false">Colen.</note>
					<note place="marg" anchored="false">The earle of Mar made regent of Scotland.</note> Dowglasse
					earle of Mourton, and Iohn Areskine earle of Mar. But in the end, vpon
					consultation which of these for most causes (both beneficiall and honorable to
					the realme and king) were méetest to wéeld so troublesome and dangerous an
					office; in the end it was laid vpon the shoulders of the last of the thrée, to
					whome (they wholie inclining) gaue full authoritie to execute the office of a
					regent. At the first entrance into which place, this Areskine, hauing nothing
					more déere or desired to and of him, than the besieging and recouerie of the
					castell and town of Edenbrough (out of the hands of the queens faction) to the
					vse of his maister and pupill (whervnto the last calends of October he was
					appointed, with a sufficient armie by the last decessed regent his predecessor)
					he was now hindered therof by sudden (and vnlooked for) turmoiles of the estates
					of the realme. Wherevpon for that instant, the same was proroged to the ides of
					the said moneth of October. Which delaie was after occasion of great impediment
					for the recouerie thereof, bicause it ministred time, power, substance, and
					succor to the citizens and capteins, to mure and strengthen the castell and
					towne, when the sharpe winter, the long nights, the hard carriage for the wars,
					preparation, and the want of sufficient furniture therefore (at the same time
					with the said turmoiles) occasioned departure from thense, without dispatch of
					that for which he came.</p>
				<p part="N">Certeine moneths after that the regent was gone from thense, there were some few
					and small excursions and skirmishes vsed amongst them, the victorie inclining to
					neither part. For the frée sight &amp; watch out of the castell of Edenborough
					(towards euerie part of the countrie) so wrought, that the quéenes faction
					should neither come to handstrokes, nor <note place="marg" anchored="false">Skirmishes about
						Edenborough.</note> yet (being vnprouided) should be intrapped with the
					deceits of their enimies: bicause by a priuie token (giuen out of the highest
					towre of the castell) they were easilie warned to recoile and draw homeward in
					conuenient time. All which notwithstanding, they once felt the smart of the
					enimie, when all the horsse and footmen were come out of the towne to intercept
					a part of the kings armie. For the kings faction (hauing first laid an ambush in
						<note place="marg" anchored="false">An ambush laid by the kings faction.</note> the vallie)
					did with the rest come before the castell, in hope to traine the towne garrison
					vpon them out of the wals of their defense, which their expectation was not
					deceiued. For the said Edenburgers made hast out of the towne, to pursue the
					said part of the kings armie, which feined a spéedie flight, to draw the other
					part further from defense of the castell. By means wherof, they of the towne did
					so egerlie pursue them so flieng, that in the end they went so far after their
					enimies, that they drew néere the ensignes of the other ambush, <!--<fw place="bot-right">"now"</fw>-->
					<pb/>

					<!--<fw place="top-left">"662"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->
					now shewing themselues out of the vallie to rescue their fellowes put to this
					feined flight. Which thing being well perceiued by the watch of the castell of
					Edenborough, foorthwith it <note place="marg" anchored="false">The quéenes part warned by the
						watch of Edenborough castell.</note> gaue the appointed signe, whereby those
					on the quéenes part (before that they came neere to the place in which they were
					laid for) began fearfullie to recoile for their better safetie; whose flight was
					the more troublesome to them, bicause they knew they were in danger, and could
					not suspect from whense or how their hurt should come, although they were before
					warned therof by the said watch of the towre. In which recoile of the quéenes
					part, the few horssemen which had before feined the flight (to draw on the
					other) returned, and <note place="marg" anchored="false">They which laie in ambush pursue those
						that came foorth to set vpŌ the kings part.</note> made such hast on the
					backe of the footmen, that the footmen were inforced (with all the spéed that
					might be) to flie vnto the citie, the next waie that euerie man could find for
					his best defense: at what time yet manie of them were wounded, and manie taken
					prisoners, as well capteins and gentlemen of armes, as others.</p>
				<p part="N">Whilest these things were thus slowlie performed, in that the towne of Edenbrough
					was with no more heat sought to be recouered, a miserable misfortune happened in
					an other part of Scotland: for a great slaughter was in the north end of the
					realme occasioned by this means. There were in that countrie two families of
					great power and authoritie, both <note place="marg" anchored="false">A conflict betwéene the
						Gordons and the Forboises.</note> valiant and wise, both harboring deadlie
					food of long rooted betwéene them. These two were of the sier-names of Gordon,
					and of Forboise, whereof the first liued with great concord and amitie amongst
					themselues, and by the kings sufferance had manie years gouerned the people
					adioining vnto them, whereby they purchased both strength amongst themselues,
					and the helpe of other men towards them: when contrarie, the Forboises were at
					wars one <note place="marg" anchored="false">The Forboises disagrée among themselues.</note> with
					another, dailie impaired their owne strength by their owne slaughters, and in
					the end wrought their owne confusion, for euerie diuided kingdome cannot long
					continue. But yet though this secret rancor did still remaine amongst these
					families, they did not in manie yeares before attempt anie open warres the one
					against the other; rather liuing in secret emulation, than open enuie, bicause
					they had (in waie of some shew of reconciliation) by marriage intermingled both
					their families togither. Among these Forboises there was one called Arthur (a
					man of singular wit, and of no lesse readie hand to performe his deuise) <note place="marg" anchored="false">Arthur Forboise.</note> who had alwaies followed the kings part
					to his vttermost, from the first time of these discords. This man therefore
					supposing this to be the time (now or neuer) wherin he must honor himselfe and
					his name, increase the substance of that part which followed him, &amp;
					suppresse the rage of the Gordons, first laboured to bring his familie to vnitie
					and mutuall loue, for all vertue gathered into it selfe is greatest strength.
					The which if he might compasse (as by anie possible meanes he would leaue no
					stone vnturned that might further it) he was then in so good safetie as he
					desired. For then was there not anie faction or familie in those parts
					whatsoeuer, whose wealth or strength he doubted, and whose state or authoritie
					he did feare.</p>
				<p part="N">For furtherance of which vnion, when daie and place was appointed to assemble the
					Forboises togither, Adam Gordon, the brother of the earle of Huntleie (deuising
					by all policie <note place="marg" anchored="false">Adam Gordon disappointeth the vnion of the
						Forboises.</note> he might to hinder the same, and hauing priuie
					intelligence thereof by his kin, fauourers, and followers) came with a great
					power of armed men vnto the same place (at the time appointed for the assemblie
					of the Forboises) to breake off their vnion. And although there were two troopes
					of the Forboises, which presentlie appéered in their sight, yet before they
					could ioine their strengths, Adam Gordon speedilie set vpon the one armie (not
					readie to be succoured by the other) and in the middle thereof did kill this
					Arthur Forboise; who <note place="marg" anchored="false">Arthur Forboise slaine.</note> being the
					hope of all that race and now slaine, his death did so amaze the other, that
					foorthwith the rest were soone ouerthrowne, scattered, and fled each one as he
					might best shift <note place="marg" anchored="false">The Forboises put to flight.</note> for
					himselfe. In which vnhappie conflict some persons of name were presentlie
					killed, and manie others taken and reserued for ransome. Whervpon the residue
					(fearing more crueltie should be vsed vpon the prisoners, loath to haue anie
					more of their race to be cut awaie, and giuing place to the time present)
					withdrew themselues from the fight, and neuer attempted anie thing afterward in
					the reuenge of their ouerthrow. Which feare and wise <!--<fw place="bot-left">"1"</fw>--><!--<fw place="bot-right">"suppression"</fw>-->
					<pb n="663"/>
					<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"663"</fw>-->
					suppression of reuenge grew not without iust cause, supposing that their
					aduersaries (if they <note place="marg" anchored="false">The house, great bellied wife, and
						children of Alexander Forboise burnt.</note> were further vrged) would shew
					no more mercie to such as they had prisoners, than they did to the house of
					Alexander Forboise before time, which they burnt with his great bellied wife and
					the other of his children.</p>
				<p part="N">The eldest brother of Arthur (who was the chiefe of that familie) hauing his
					house so spoiled, and himselfe hardlie escaping from his enimies hands, hastned
					to the court, from whense (though the matter was in great extremitie) he was by
					the king to he releeued. For which cause there were appointed two hundred
					footmen to such of the nobilitie as fauoured <note place="marg" anchored="false">The Forboises
						receiue aid from the king.</note> and followed that faction, with letters to

					These thus confederat and come togither to the rest of the Forboises, with
					certeine other families of their affinitie &amp; neighbours, so aduanced the
					spirit of this Alexander, that he sow thought himselfe sufficientlie fensed
					against all the forces of his aduersaries. But as their number increased, so
					there wanted amongst them one person sufficient to inioy the place of a
					capteine, whome the rest might follow, sith all the principals and heads of the
					families were almost yoong men, and scarse one better than others in degrée of
					calling. Wherefore the assemblie being drawen into diuerse companies (for they
						<note place="marg" anchored="false">The Forboises follow seuerall leaders.</note>
					<note place="marg" anchored="false">Iohn Keth departed.</note>
					<note place="marg" anchored="false">Alexander Forboise goeth to A erden.</note> were inforced to
					follow seuerall leaders) Iohn Keth with fiue hundred horssemen departed to his
					house not far from thense. Alexander Forboise with his retinue and two hundred
					footmen went to Aberden, to expell Adam Gordon from thense, and to repare his
					armie in the iournie.</p>
				<p part="N">Adam Gordon (not sléeping his affaires, knowing the preparation of the Forboises,
					and vnderstanding the approch of his enimie so néere with so small companie)
					assembled his people, led them out of the towne, and compelled the citizens to
					follow, to make the number of his armie to séeme the greater. Shortlie after, in
					a field next adioining to the towne, <note place="marg" anchored="false">The Forboises
						ouerthrowen besides Aberden.</note> the two companies met, and a sharpe
					conflict was committed betwéene them. In which the kings footmen (appointed to
					the Forboises) desirous (more hastilie than wiselie) to fight, and aduenturing
					further in following of the Gordons (than their shot of powder would continue)
					they went so far, that in the end (being out of the reach of defense or helpe of
					their companie) they were put to fearfull flight by the bowmen of the Gordons,
					who pursued them egerlie, and continued the battell vntill night. At what time
					there were not manie of the vanquished slaine, but mostlie taken and reserued as
					prisoners, amongst which was the said Alexander Forboise taken, after that he
					had long and valiantlie defended himselfe against his enimies in the same
					conflict, to the perpetuall glorie of that house.</p>
				<p part="N">After the suppression of the Forboises in the north parts, the quéenes fauourers
					were highlie incouraged to attempt greater matters. Wherefore assembling their
					power out of <note place="marg" anchored="false">Iedworth defended from assault.</note> diuerse
					parts of the kingdome, they bend their minds to the suppressing of Iedworth, a
					towne which after the manner of the countrie is vnwalled and vnfensed, but
					onelie with the strength of the inhabitants: which towne (certeine yeares past
					had stronglie resisted the force of the quéenes faction. Neere vnto this towne
					were neighbours Thomas Car of <note place="marg" anchored="false">Thomas Car.</note>
					<note place="marg" anchored="false">Walter Scot.</note> Ferniherst, and Walter Scot, both which
					besides their owne retinue had ioined vnto them the people of the next
					countries, being Lidesdale, Euian, and Eskine, alwaies troubled with robberie
					and giuen to spoile, who at that time by the libertie of war fréelie without
					restreint, did wander into further countries, to preie, spoile and catch what
					they could. Besides whom there were also in Teuiot (aswell by the infection of
					these countries, as by the custome of spoiling in the wars, for these things
					were by vse made an other nature and priullege, as it were from the note and
					paine of sin) great families defamed with such theft and rapines, and not these

					(being allured with hope of preie, and supposing all things lawfull in ciuill
					warres) ioined togither; and (to make their number the greater, and their power
					the stronger) called from Edenborough one hundred and twentie harquebushers,
					chosen out of the chéefest souldiers, to be assistant vnto them.</p>
				<p part="N">The inhabitants of Iedworth (not ignorant of their intent, and considering

					this preparation tended) with spéedie &amp; fearefull messengers signifie vnto
					Iohn Areskine earle of Mar &amp; regent, the present danger wherein they stood,
					crauing some succor of light furnished souldiers to be sent to them, which
					foorthwith was granted accordinglie. Wherevpon Walter Car of Stefford, being
					called before the regent for that cause, had the charge of such <note place="marg" anchored="false">Walter Car sent to defend Iedworth.</note> aid granted vnto
					him, as a person who both for valure &amp; experience was of sufficiencie to
					discharge anie such matter laied vpon him. Besides which, a conuenient number of
					sufficient souldiers, gathered out of the countries adioining, for that season
					assembled themselues in defense of the towne, &amp; ioined their armie with them
					at Iedworth. At what time also to strike more feare in the one part &amp; to
					aduance the courage of the other part, it was noised amongst both armies that
					William Ruthwine with a hundred shot and certeine horsmen (wherof he <note place="marg" anchored="false">William Ruthwine with a power comming to Driburge.</note>
					brought part with him, and part he gathered out of the marches adioining) were
					at the same time comming to Driburge with the said Ruthwine. All which
					notwithstanding, the queenes faction trusting to their owne strength consisting
					in multitude (for they were in number thrée thousand men) did earlie in the
					morning draw towards the towne, to preuent the comming of such succours as both
					were promised, looked for, and then almost at hand. Which being by Ruthwine
					partlie before suspected, he hastened the people with more spéed to follow them
					at the héeles, and by continuall shot weried the taile of his aduersaries with
					often assaults and skirmishes.</p>
				<p part="N">Walter Car also ioining vnto him and to his complices the townes men (readie to
						<note place="marg" anchored="false">Walter Car ioineth with William Ruthwine.</note> defend
					their titles, their goods, their wiues, and their children) tooke the direct
					waie towards his enimies, to the end the better to suppresse them and their
					vnited force. Which when the aduerse part perceiued, foorthwith they retired to
					places of more defense, lest they shuld incounter their enimies with doubtfull
					battell; and least being set vpon before and behind, they might be suddenlie
					inclosed, before they could be able to turne themselues, either to escape, or to
					preuent the approching enimie. At what time such as sought after spoile, and
					were allured to that warre with hope of gaine, being now by that means defrauded
					of their preie, when they saw the towne manfullie defended, and the kings part
					readilie and <note place="marg" anchored="false">The quéenes faction flie awaie.</note> stronglie
					come foorth to battell, left the field, and departed euerie man to his owne
					house, as it was néerest to the place where they then remained. Whose sudden
					flight, without any occasion of danger, being vnderstood of the chiefe of the
					rest of such as were of the queenes faction (supposing at the first nothing
					lesse than that the enimie would make vpon them) they also followed after the
					others, raised their campe, and departed to Hawike with the rest of their
					followers and companie of footmen, hoping thereby to escape all danger, by
					resson of the sharpenesse of the winter and late fall of the snow, which would
					staie the following of the enimie.</p>
				<p part="N">But Ruthwine, iudging it best to vse the opportunitie of time, did before dale so
					spéedilie <note place="marg" anchored="false">Ruthwine with his armie commeth to Hawike.</note>
					lead his armie to Hawike, that he was within a mile of his enimies, before they
					could by anie means be certified of his comming. Whose spéedie and vnlooked for
					approch did strike such extreame feare into the hearts of those which possessed
					Hawike, that there was no place left for anie consultation; but presentlie that
					euerie one should shift for himselfe as well as hée might. Wherevpon suddenlie
					bringing foorth their horsses and footmen, and following the course of the next
					riuer, they attempted to withdraw into places of more safetie <note place="marg" anchored="false">The quéens faction ouer-throwne and dispersed at Hawike.</note> for
					themselues, and further from their enimies. But the horssemen of Ruthwine
					spéedilie following at their héeles, so preuented their deuise, that forsaking
					their footmen, they fled ouer all the countrie to the places best knowne vnto
					them.</p>
				<p part="N">Vpon which the footmen being thus left to the spoile and preie of their enimies,
					did (for their more safegard) hide themselues in a little wood adioining to the
					said riuer. In which, being on euerie side beset with the force of their
					aduersaries (fullie determined to preie vpon them) they did in the end wholie
					yéeld themselues with submission to their courtesie. Whervpon (sith they were
					not able like prisoners, for their number was ouer great to be caried about from

					to depart, some few being still reteined in that place as pledges for the others

					deceiuing their faith <note place="marg" anchored="false">Kircawdie causeth the prisoners not to
						returne at their daie appointed.</note> with his light promises, forbad them
					to returne at their daie appointed, and made them incurre the note of periurie.
					The rest of the winter, and all the next spring was passed foorth with light
					skirmishes on both parties of the kings and quéenes factions, in which few lost
					their liues, and of that few more on the quéens than kings part. For the quéenes
					fauourers, remaining in the mounteins next adioining to the citie, whilest they
					would take occasion and aduantage to performe anie thing well, would (scarse
					entring into the danger of the conflict) for the most part retire, and flie into
					the citie for more defense.</p>
				<p part="N">In the meane time, while these things were thus ordered, there came manie
					ambassadors <note place="marg" anchored="false">Ambassadors out of England.</note> out of
					England, to pacifie these discords growne to these great extremities, betweene
					the king and the imprisoned quéenes factions. But the same ambassage so well
					meant by the quéene of England, and reiected by the seditious of Scotland,
					sorted not to that end which was meant, nor as the state of Scotland required.
					Wherefore these ambassadors returned home without anie such dispatch as might
					answer their trauels their mistresse care and loue, and the vnities of that
					quarelsome people: by reason that the Frenchmen fauouring the cause of the
					banished queene, did not onelie hinder the peace and quiet of the Scots, for the
					benefit of the realme; but also sought warres for the destruction of the
					naturall subiects, and to bring in their owne gouernement; who for the
					furtherance thereof, did with great promises interteine the apt minds of the
					quarrelling faction, to kindle and mainteine the fire of continuall warre,
					vntill such time as by force they had gotten the vpper hand, and brought the
					kings fauourers to destruction. For the better support whereof, the French <note place="marg" anchored="false">The French king sendeth monie into Scotland.</note> king sent
					some portion of monie, which being of it selfe not great, or such as their
					necessitie required, seemed rather sufficient to nourish an hope of abilitie to
					mainteine the warres, than fullie to dispatch or defraie the charges or the
					affaires therein; and that the rather, bicause some part of that monie was euer
					deuoured by such as had the cariage thereof.</p>
				<p part="N">Amongst these things there still continued, for a few moneths, certeine light
					skirmishes to little purpose betwéene the aduerse parties. But the greater
					companie, who could not satisfie their eagles minds with litle flies, absteined
					not from robbing and burning the countrie. For Adam Gordon, entring into Angus,
					besieged the house of William Dowglasse of <note place="marg" anchored="false">Adam Gordon
						entreth Angus, and besiegeth the house of William Dowglasse.</note>
					<note place="marg" anchored="false">They of Dundée craue aid out of Fife.</note> Glemberuie: but
					after that long besiege, perceiuing that the man whome he sought for, was not to
					Be found there, he cruellie destroied all whatsoeuer there was left, consuming
					it with fire and sword. Which tyrannie did strike such fearfull impression into
					the harts of those of Dundée, that they despairing of their owne abilitie to
					resist them, called their neighbours of Fife vnto their aid, sith they were next
					adioining vnto them, vnto whom also Gordon was a persecuting enimie continuallie
					in all that possiblie he might, bicause they constantlie and subiect like did in
					all dutie support the kings part.</p>
				<p part="N">At which time Blackenesse being betraied to the Hamiltons by the kéeper of that
					castell, <note place="marg" anchored="false">Blacknesse betraied.</note> did greatlie hinder the
					traffike and passage betwéene Leith and Sterling. For which cause the regent as
					a person that heedfullie looked into the dangers of that time, and with wise
					forecast sought to preuent following euils, brake downe all the mils about
					Edenburgh, <note place="marg" anchored="false">Edenburgh mils broken.</note> furnished all the
					noble mens houses and places of defense with garrisons néere vnto the towne, and

				<p part="N">These things thus depending, and the king and the deposed quéenes faction

					hoping either to set a finall end to these inconueniences, or at least to
					mitigate and staie that furie, that it should not at that present, or during the
					kings minoritie passe anie further. For the accomplishment whereof, sir William
					Drurie knight, and Thomas Randolph esquier, were sent from the queene of
					England: and monsieur de Croque, who had also béene ambassador out of France
					into Scotland before that time, was now againe sent thither from the French

				<p part="N">These much about one time arriuing in Scotland, and ioining togither concerning

					abstinence of warre to be had betweene the parties of the king and quéenes

					for the election of a new regent to succéed in his place, that might in all

					being knowne to the Scots, and they finding that their most aid &amp; surest

				<p part="N">Wherevpon she said Henrie Killigrew made a quiet end and pacification of all

				<p part="N">During the time of which session of this parlement, manie occurrents deseruing
					remembrance happened after the said fiftéenth of Ianuarie. For Edenborough
					castell being <note place="marg" anchored="false">Skirmishes about Edenborough.</note> somewhat
					distressed, the castilians were put from sallieng out of the castell gate, where
					capteine Craiford, and capteine Hume laie with their bands to keepe them in.
					Notwithstanding all which, they within repaired vnto a posterne in the northside
					of the castell besides saint Cutberts church, and saint Margarets well, where
					they issued and fet water at their pleasure: which being espied by their
					enimies, capteine Michaell and his band came from Dondiske to stop their passage
					thereto. Who within thrée daies after such his approch, destroied their well,
					and inforced them to kéepe within the wals of the castell: at what time the
					regent aduanced his trenches made against the castell, from the bulworke or
					spurre of that castell to the west part: and from thense, to saint Cutberts
					kirke: so that with the water lieng on the southwestside, and the regents power
					on the other side, the castell was wholie inuironed. During which siege, the
					sixteenth of the same moneth, the castilians, to feare such as were assembled in
					the forenamed parlement kept within the towne of Edenborough, bestowed
					fourescore and seuen great shot vpon the towne, which harmed not anie one
					creature, but a poore dog that was slaine before the doore of the regents house:
					although men, women, and children did dailie frequent and passe the stréets of
					the towne. Which was a rare matter, but yet not more strange than this: that
					there was not slaine on the regents part (from the first of the moneth of
					Ianuarie vntill this time, either by great or small shot in the towne or
					trenches, skirmishes or otherwise) aboue six persons, and within the castell but
					three, with as manie hurt betweene the tolbooth and the spurre of the castell.
					The cause whereof grew by reason of thrée trauerses made ouerthwart the streets
					to saue the people, besides the other trenches made against the castell: at what
					time also the tolbooth and the church was fensed with a rampier forced of
					turffes, fagots, and other stuffe fit for that purpose. Whereby the lords of the

					as quietlie and safelie to the church to heare diuine seruice, as they at anie
					time did before the warres began, and before that the castell was besieged.</p>

				<p part="N">This letter by the lord Grange capteine of the castell thus in due sort receiued,
					he not regarding the contents thereof, nor considering the mild disposition of
					such as went about to spare their bloud, did vtterlie denie the surrender of the
					castell, and with all force determined to defend themselues. Wherewith the
					English generall greatlie grieued, did incortinently redeliuer such answer to
					the said lord Grange as wrought an vtter discontent and mislike in the man. By
					meanes of which the pioners attending their charge, with expedition applied the
					casting of trenches and erecting of mounts or fortresses to piant the artillerie
					therevpon against the castell. After which euerie one hastening the cause of his
					comming, &amp; ioining their force togither, began to inuiron the towne, &amp;
					to laie siege to the castell in fiue seuerall places, where were fiue seuerall
					fortresses erected for that cause, intituled by these names. The first mount
					allotted to the regent, had the name of the kings mount, the second the generall
					thereof the English sir William Drurie did possesse, the third was in charge of
					sir George Carie, the fourth was called sir Henrie Leies mount, and the fift
					fell to the gouernement of Thomas Sutton maister of the ordinance in the north
					parts of England. The whole number of which armie vnder paie was two thousand,
					wherof fiftéene hundred were English, and the other fiue hundred Scots: besides
					the nobilitie and gentlemen with their companie, and the citizens of Edenborough
					defended with thirtie péeces of artillerie conteining six canons, nine
					demicanons, nine culuerings, and six sacres. Whilest the armie without was thus
					preparing for to assaile the companie within, the capteine of the castell (to
					hinder their worke) liberallie saluted the pioners &amp; other souldiors with
					such artillerie as they had within the castell, and vpon and about the walles
					thereof; whereby manie were hurt, some slaine, but more hindered before the
					trenches and mounts might be brought to their due perfection, for defense of the
					assailants, and offense of the assailed. In which action also the aduerse part
					forgot not to requite the castillians, but mostlie after that the pioners and
					laborers had finished the mounts. At what time they gaue vehement and sharpe
					assault to the castell, although that the extreame heat thereof began not vntill
					the seauentéenth daie of Maie following. In which siege on the said seauentéenth
					daie of Maie, the castell was most roughlie assailed by thirtie shot of canon
					discharged against the same. At what time those peeces so well performed their
					parts against Dauids tower, that the force of the English canons was easie to be
					then and long after seene therein. Which assalt continued vntill the one and
					twentith daie of Maie following, on which daie the whole batterie began not
					againe as before against part, but wholie round about on ech side of the
					castell. For vntill then Dauids towre was onelie the marke of the enimie: but
					after that daie they laid out their power in euerie place, offending and
					defending ech others soldiors, as well within the <!--<fw place="bot-right">"castell"</fw>-->
					<pb n="671"/>
					<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"671"</fw>-->
					castell as within the mounts and trenches in that sharpe conflict hurting and
					killing manie of the English and Scots. Wherevpon the diligence of the English
					began to be so great, that they forthwith displaced the ordinance in the
					castell, and stroke one of their greatest péeces iust in the mouth: whereby the
					same was broken, and the castillians force somewhat abated.</p>
				<p part="N">After this on the six and twentith daie of the said moneth of Maie, there was a
					fresh assault giuen at seuen of the clocke in the morning to the Spurre (a place
					of defense or blockehouse before the said castell) which by the assailants was
					taken, &amp; forthwith vpon the entrance therin was the banner of the generall
					displaied and set vp, to declare who possessed the same, to the great discomfort
					of them in the castell. For although before they had lost the vse of one of
					their great péeces, that their walles were battered, that some of their men were
					slaine, &amp; that they had almost all their water taken from them: yet would
					they not yéeld, neither did anie whit begin to despaire of kéeping the castell,
					or repelling the enimie; vntill such time as the English had now gotten the
					possession of the Spurre.</p>
				<p part="N">Now, during the time that these gaue the assault to the Spurre, there was an
					other band of Englishmen and Scots, that had in charge to make shew of a fresh
					assault, at the west part of the castell; to the end that such as laied batterie
					to the Spurre, might with more ease to themselues, and lesse suspicion of the
					aduerse part, obteine the said Spurre. But this last named band, ouer hastilie
					putting themselues in aduenture beyond the limits of their charge, were repelled
					and driuen to the recoile, with the hurt and losse of thirtie persons, or
					thereabous. All which notwithstanding, the castillians (perceiuing their
					chiefest defense the Spurre to be lost, and not greatlie reioising of this small
					victorie ouer those which assailed them on the west side) did the same daie by a
					drumme demand parlee: which they obteined with truce of peace from that daie,
					vntill the eight and twentith of Maie next following. For which cause the lard
					of Pittadrow, was let downe by a rope from the castell, and after him the lard
					of Grange, capteine of the said castell, with Robert Meluine; all which came to
					haue conference with the generall sir William Drurie, &amp; such other persons
					as were chosen to accompanie him about the same. In the end, vpon much
					conferrence had betweene the Scotish lards and the generall, the castell was the
					same eight and twentith daie (in which the truce ended) deliuered vp into the
					hands of the said sir William Drurie, which he kept in his possession for a
					certeine time; during whose abode in the castell, he set vp and spred his
					ensignes and banners vpon sundrie parts of the wals of the same.</p>
				<p part="N">This doone, the generall (after quiet possession had, not determining to reteine
					it vnto his nistresse vse, sith he was onelie appointed by hir to aid the king
					of Scots, and such of the nobilitie as tooke his part) did after (according to
					his commission) deliuer ouer the same castell to the vse of the yong king of
					Scots; for which cause not meaning vtterlie to spoile the castell, he gaue but
					part of the spoile to the vse of the soldiers, leauing the canons and other
					artillerie to the kings pleasure. For before the surrender of the castell, it
					was agréed, that if the Englishmen had by force taken it, as they obteined it by
					composition, that then they should wholie haue inioied the full spoile by the
					space of thrée daies, the artillerie onelie excepted, which should be carried
					awaie by the English. But sith for these causes following, the same could not
					abide anie long siege, but must of necessitie yéeld it selfe, there was euerie
					part of the said spoile giuen vnto the souldiers vpon the deliuerie of the same
					castell to sir William Drurie. The causes of which surrender were manie.</p>
				<p part="N">First, for that they were depriued of water, bicause the well within the castell
					was chokedwith the ruines of the castell wals; &amp; the other well without
					could not serue them, bicause there was a mount made to hinder them. An other
					water there was (which was vnknowne to such as were without the castell) and was
					taken from them by the losse of the Spurre, out of which they were woont to haue
					a pint a daie for euerie souldier. The other causes of surrender were these.</p>

				<pb n="672"/>

				<!--<fw place="top-left">"672"</fw>-->
				<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->

				<p part="N">Secondlie, diuerse persons were sicke, especiallie thorough drinke of the water
					of saint Margarets well without the castell on the north side, which had béene
					poisoned by some of their enimies.</p>
				<p part="N">Thirdlie, diuerse others were hurt.</p>
				<p part="N">Fourthlie, not manie to mainteine the castell, and they not able to take anie
					rest, being so plied and dailie wearied with batterie.</p>
				<p part="N">Fiftlie, diuerse of the souldiers diuided in opinions.</p>
				<p part="N">Sixtlie, some were no souldiers at all.</p>
				<p part="N">Seauenthlie, that no aid was to be looked for by the waie of France.</p>
				<p part="N">The eight and chiefe cause was, that the regent and his forces planted in the
					strengths round about, and the horssemen dailie and nightlie watching and
					riding, which held and tooke from them all vittels, and had brought them to
					great scant of food before the siege began. All these eight causes mooued the
					said surrender of the castell.</p>
				<p part="N">After that the castell was thus gotten, the sixtéenth daie of Iune following, the
					prisoners were deliuered by the said sir William Drurie, in the presence of
					sundrie Scots &amp; Englishmen, vnto the regent; and that doone, the same daie
					sir William Drurie departed with his power to Berwike. The names of the
					prisoners were these; sir William Kircawdie lard of Grange, and capteine of the
					castell of Edenborough, the lord Hume, William Metellan, lord of Lethington
					secretarie, the lard of Pittadrow constable of the castell, the countesse of
					Argile, the ladie of Lethington and the ladie of Grange, with others. But yet
					the priuat soldiers &amp; others of meaner sort were suffered to depart with bag
					and baggage.</p>
				<p part="N">Thus was the castell of Edenborough woone, as you haue heard, which by the common
					opinion of men was impregnable, and not to be taken by force; insomuch as manie
					thought it tooke the name of the maiden castell, for that it had not béene woone
					at any time before except by famine or practise. Which opinion being common is
					so much the falser, in that the common sort doo imbrace it, for that they
					iustlie incline to common fables. For this castell was not surnamed the maiden
					castell, bicause it was neuer taken by force: but bicause the princes children
					were there nourished, as maie well appeare by that which I shall set downe
					touching the antiquitie of this towne &amp; the name thereof; of which there be
					diuerse opinions. For some will haue it to be built by Eboracus, of some called
					Ebrancus king of Britaines, called also in British Castle mynid Agnes, the
					castle of saint Agnes hill, afterward the castell of virgins. But Lesleus will
					haue it built long after the time of H. Lhoid, by the space of six hundred foure

					Chrutnæus Camelonus Pictorum imperium tenebant." Now this king Chrutneus that
					built Agneda, liued before Christ three hundred and fiue yeares by the Scots
					account, and Eborac or Ebranke liued nine hundred foure score &amp; nine yeares
					before Christ: so that the Englishmen make this towne more ancient than the
					Scots. But as Lesleus hath mistaken himselfe, following Boetius, to place
					Camelodunum in Scotland: so hath he appointed Edenburgh to be built by the
					Scots, being built by the Britaines. But true it might be that Eborac first
					builded it, &amp; that being in the space of six hundred foure score and foure
					yeares wasted and vtterlie decaied, the same was afresh erected by Chrutneus,
					and after repared by Ethus. The castell of which towne, being sometime appointed
					for the bringing vp of the daughters of the noblemen of the Picts, vntill they
					were mariageable, was for that cause (and not bicause it was neuer woone by
					force) called the maiden castell, as the said Lesleus affirmeth. But after, when
					christianitie came into Scotland, it was called (as I coniecture) Agneda,
					bicause it was the castell that stood on saint Agnes hill, &amp; not before the

					place, what became of both the said earledoms, as well in hir life, as after hir
					and hir sonne Charls his death. Touching Angus, this ladie Margaret, vpon the
					mariage of hir son Henrie lord Darneleie, which was solemnized the nine and
					twentith daie of Iulie 1565, to Marie queene of Scots, did giue the said
					earledome with all the rights and members thereof vnto the said queene Marie, to

					earledome of Lennox, after the slaughter of Matthew earle of Lennox (husband to
					this Margaret) which was in Sterling the fourth of September, in the yeare of

					performed by other nations in that kingdome. Amongst which accidents in Scotland
					this rarelie happened, that the earle Morton surrendered his protectorship or

					rare, sith men in so great authoritie of commanding all persons, can hardlie be

					being verie wise, feared not the alteration of his estate, but rather desired to

					declaring the singular good of such, which doo shun the gouernement of temporall
					things, in these words. "Quasi quodam iugo seruitutis premunt prospera, dum

					and foure, put Alexander Leuinstone knight from his regentship, and tooke vpon

					Lesleus. "Gubernatoris cancellarijque concilio &amp; iussu factum est, vt omnium
					ordinum comitijs Striueling indies diceretur. An. Dom. 440, mense Ianuarij,
					omniumn assensu est constitutum, vt rex suum regnum lustrans, contentiones

				<p part="N">After which, about fiue yeares following, the same Iames, to shew his absolute

					lord Gourdon earle of Huntleie, and George Lesle a baron earle of Rothseie.
					Iames the fourth of that name king of Scotland, being but sixtéene yeares of age
					when he came to the crowne, in the yeare of Christ one thousand foure hundred

					<!--<fw place="top-left">"686"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->
					common thing: for there were three great persons in short time dispatched after
					tabt sort, which were the earles of Murreie and Leneux regents, &amp; this lord
					Glames chancellor. After the death of which lord Glames, the earle of Atholl was
					aduanced to that place, and <note place="marg" anchored="false">The earle of Atholl made

					Wherefore hauing so good occasion therefore at this time by talking of this

					not inconuenient in this place, nor disagreeable to the nature of the matter
					which I haue in hand, somewhat by waie of digression, to discourse of the
					originall of this office in Scotland, of the etymon of the name, and other
					circumstances belonging thereto.</p>
				<p part="N">This officer the chancellor had his first originall in Scotland by Malcolme the
					second of <note place="marg" anchored="false">The originall of the office of the
						chancellor.</note> that name king of Scots, who beginning his reigne in the
					yeare of our redemption one thousand and ten, and gouerning thirtie yeares,
					departed the world in the yeare of Christ one thousand and fortie. This man,
					during the time of his gouernment, ordeining manie necessarie lawes for the
					better rule of his countrie, and for the benefit of the crowne, did also first
					ordeine the honorable officers of the kingdome, as chancellor, conestable,
					marshall, chamberleine, and others, as appeareth by Lesleus in the historie of
					Scotland in these words: "Fœliciter rempublicam haud paucos annos administrauit
					(king Malcolme) multis &amp; egregijs <note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Lesleus
							lib.</emph> 1. <emph>pag.</emph> 204.</note> operibus illustris:
					intérque cætera municipialium legum volumen condidit, quas nostrates exinde in
					iudicijs ferendis seruarunt, nihil pene immutatas, regiorum magistratuum
					iudicumque, quos licet mundiús, magisque Latinè vocare possunt, vulgò tamen
					cancellarium, conestabilem, mariscallum, camerarium, iusticiariúmque vocitant,
					&amp; qui a secretis, a thesauris, a cubiculo, a chartophylaceo essent:
					cunctorúmque ministrorum aulæ annua saleria, vt nostris dicbus penduntur,
					quantúmque regijs pro diplomatibus, ac cæteris literis, libellionibus,
					tabularjs, lectoribúsque soluendum foret, instituit. This officer being in
					Scotland before the time of Edward the Confessor, seemeth also to me couertlie
					to proue, that the same officer was in England before the time of the same king,
					sith it appeareth, that the Scots for the most part haue alwaies taken their
					maner of gouernement, lawes, and customes from vs, as will be I doubt not
					sufficientlie proued, although it maie be that some will affirme that they might
					haue this officer from the Frenchmen and Romans as other nations had: which as I
					doo not suppose, because the Romans had but little dooings amongest them, for as
					they neuer vsed anie such officer in this land whilest they gouerned here (for
					anie thing that I can yet learne) so it may be, (because they will not séeme to
					haue borrowed anie order of their gouernement from vs) that they will suppose
					that they had the first ground of this officer from the French, with whome they
					haue alwaies beene in league euer since the time of their king Achaius the
					first, who (beginning his reigne in the yeare of Christ seuen hundred fourescore
					and eight) did knit a perpetuall league with Charles the great. But leauing that
					to be as it will (sith it is no dishonor for one nation to deriue their good
					lawes, beneficiall customes, or needfull officers from another, no more than it
					was for the Romans to fetch their lawes of the twelue tables from the Grecians)
					true it is, that this officer so ordeined by Malcolme amongst the Scots, was
					such an officer as was vsed amongst the Romans, touching the cause of whose
					name, the ciuilians affirme that he was called "Cancellarius à cancellando,
					cuius officium est rescripta, vel responsa imperatoris, &amp; mandata inspicere,
					mala scripta cancellare, &amp; bene scripta cum signaculo suo signare, &amp;
					sigillum eis imprimere." Of which word chancellor is risen this name, "
					Archicancellarius quasi princeps cancellariæ," as is noted by Azo in summa.</p>
				<p part="N">This officer taking his name of <emph>Cancellando,</emph> (that is of defacing,
					blotting, or putting out of writings,) did vse to adnull all writings, as we at
					this daie doo obserue in our chancerie, by drawing certeine strokes or lines
					made crosse one upon an other ouer the writing, in forme of woodden latices, in
					Latine termed <emph>Cancelli,</emph> which are either such latices as we at this
					daie, and of antiquitie vsed in windowes, or such as were made to compasse about
					the iudgement seats. For thus said the ciuilians touching that; "Cancelli sunt
					ligna inter se modicis interuallis in transuersum connexa, quibus tribunalia,
					scænæ &amp; fenestræ muniri <!--<fw place="bot-right">"consueuerunt."</fw>-->
					<pb n="687"/>
					<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"687"</fw>-->
					consueuerunt." And Cicero saith in his first booke '<emph>De oratore;</emph>'
					"Forensibus cancellis circumscriptam sententiam, &amp;c." From which word
						<emph>Cancelli,</emph> is deduced this word <emph>Cancellare.</emph> For
					thus doo some write thereof: "Cancello verbum videtur esse deductum à Cancellis,
					in quibus vt transuersaria nectuntur ligna, ita cum scripta expungenda sunt,
					transuerso calamo lineæ inducuntur, quod propriè illinere, seu allinere est, vel
					litura:" whervpon thus writeth Q. F. Horace the liricall poet in his tract
					called the art of poetrie: <quote rend="block"><lg xml:lang="la" part="N" org="uniform" sample="complete">
							<l part="N">"—incomptis allinet atrum</l>
							<l part="N">Transuerso calamo signum, &amp;c:"</l>
						</lg></quote> as who should saie, He dooth cancell and blot out the writing
					with lines drawne one ouer an other like latices, the ciuilians fullie agreeing
					to the same and saieng, that "Cancellare <note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Gl. in l. si
							quis, libertatem de pot. hœred.</emph></note> est scripta transductus
					lineis instar cancellorum delere." Beside which this word
						<emph>Cancellarius</emph> is also by some (whose curious ears and pens count
					the words of former ages to be barbarous) taken scarselie for good Latine, and
					therefore saie that this officer more purelie ought to be called <emph>Scribarum
						præfectus,</emph> of which number Polydor Virgil is one, who in his
					admonidon to the reader, at the end of his historie of England, setteth downe
					these words: "Monitum te optime lector volo, per multa verba minùs Latina longo
					vsu non item ratione iam primùm in consuetudinem quotidiani sermonis venisse,
					sic vt velimus nolimus ea interdum vsurpare cogamur, cuiusmodi sunt dux &amp;
					comes, olim officij tantùm at summæ nūc dignitatis vocabula. Item comitatus pro
					regione, cancellarius pro scribarum, abbas prior pro monachorum præfecto:" and
					Leland calleth the chancellor <emph>Archigrammateus.</emph> Besides which there
					be some in our age, who searching after the originall &amp; etymologies of
					names, affirme this word chancellor to be deriued from the Saxon toong, as it
					were a cleare or shining person or one excelling other men: compounding that
					word of these two parts, chance and clere, in which word this part clere dooth
					after the Saxon signifie in Latine <emph>Prœeminens</emph> or
						<emph>clarus,</emph> and that part chance must note to vs a man. But how
					aptlie and truelie the same may stand to make the etymon of chancellor, I leaue
					to others to consider. This thus said for the originall and name of the officer
					called the chancellor, of whose succession we will talke hereafter, and will now
					returne to the matters of Scotland in this sort.</p>
				<p part="N">In the moneth of Iulie there was a parlement of the nobilitie assembled, where

					<note place="marg" anchored="false">Robert Steward created earle of Leneux.</note> Steward great

					countries: where he behaued himselfe right valiantlie to his owne and his
					countries commendation. For when the warres were at the hottest in those <note place="marg" anchored="false">The tragicall historie of the ciuill warres of the low

					<note place="marg" anchored="false">Church yards choice.</note> low countries betweene the states
					and king Philip (at what time the archduke Matthias was generall for the
					noblemen or states, and Iohn duke of Austria, the base sonne of Charles the

					the first of August, in this yeare that the armie of the duke of Austria comming
					to visit the armie of the states (which laie then incamped in the field called
					Reminant) that in the armie (as I said before composed of diuerse nations both
					footmen and horssemen) there was amongst others one companie of Scots vnder the
					leading of Steward their capteine and countriman, who being with his companie
					called foorth into the battell, was appointed to keepe the streict on the left
					side, when the English should keepe the like streict on the right hand. After
					which the enimie making towards the armie of the states, they were <!--<fw place="bot-right">"tercepted"</fw>-->

					<!--<fw place="top-left">"688"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->
					intercepted by the English, who interteined them with such sufficient skirmish,
					as that they forced Don Iohns men to giue ground and retire towards the strength
					of the Scots (which the same Steward had in charge) and that so farre, that in
					the same action the English brought themselues betwixt the enimie and the Scots,
					who mistaking the companie, and supposing them to be their enimies, gaue them
					from the hedge, where they laie such a volee of shot, that it made them to loose
					more ground than euer the enimie could haue doone.</p>
				<p part="N">The enimie in the meane time perceiuing that, and being now fighting vpon the
					retreict came forward with great force and furie, hauing a new supplie of
					numbers of fresh souldiors to succour them. All which notwithstanding they could
					not for all that they might do, force them to abandon the streict which they had
					in charge, vntill such time as certeine Englishmen (that were left within the
					closes to discouer the enimie) brought word that the enimie had entred the
					streict vpon the Scots. Which thing was in deed verie true, for euen at that
					instant the fire was seene to arise in the village, and the whole forces which
					were to enter betweene the water and the English companies, retired themselues
					to the heath againe. The Scots then valiantlie making good their fight vpon the
					retreict, the lieutenant of the English was likewise driuen to the same: which
					if he had not doone, the enimie had cut betwixt him, his companie and the
					trenches. This being well perceiued by capteine Liggins, he presentlie aduanced
					himselfe, and was now come halfe the waie to the succour of the lieutenant, to
					preuent the enimie, and to ioine with the forces of the same lieutenant, all who
					being gotten togither doo retire to the church, and perceiuing that the enimie
					came on appase, the lieutenant of the English leaueth capteine Liggins to a
					reasonable ground of strength to interteine them, when he himselfe rideth backe
					to fetch releefe for capteine Liggins his retreict.</p>
				<p part="N">The enimie seeing the streict of the waie, and that their other forces preuailed
					more on the other streict forsooke anie longer to attempt the same against the
					English, and retired themselues all they might on the side ouer the closes, to
					ioine them with their other forces, which had euen now passed the streict which
					the Scots had in gard, who all togither made hast vp to the hill, and so to the
					burnt house, then fired by the Scots, at that instant forsaking the field, and
					retiring them to the campe, after that they had obteined victorie against the
					Spaniards, by valiant resisting &amp; pursuing the force of the enimie. At what
					time also maister Norris coronell of the English and the forenamed maister
					Steward coronell of the Scots, carried awaie the whole commendation of this
					victorie obteined by the men of these two nations of England and Scotland. But
					leauing the Scots reioising of this good successe in those low countries, we
					will call backe our pen and resalute the countrie of Scotland, at this time in
					some ciuill dissentions amongst themselues, whereof these manie yeares, since
					the gouernment of this yoong king, it seemeth to me that it hath not long beene
					free.</p>
				<p part="N">In the forenamed moneth of August, there grew secret dissention amongst the
					nobilitie at home, which still continued &amp; fed the former vnkindlie fire of
					contention betweene the two factions of the yoong king, and the imprisoned
					queene: by occasion wherof the realme was diuided into three parts, some
					following the king, some standing on the queenes side, &amp; some assisting
					neither of both, all which by some were termed by three seuerall names; as the
					kings faction, the part of the male-contents, and the neutrals, consisting of
					such as remained indifferent on both sides, neither seeking to vphold the one or
					to suppresse the other. Amongst which on the kings part were manie earls, lords
					and bishops, as Dowglasse erle Morton admerall of Scotland, Dowglasse erle of
					Angus, Dowglasse earle of Buquhane, Areskin earle of Marre, Steward earle
					Bothwell, Cuningham earle of Glenkarne, Lesleh earle of Wrothouse, Montgomerie
					earle of Eglington, Steward earle of Orkeneie, and Steward earle of Leneux, all
					which were in house with the king, and attendant vpon his person, with whom were
					confederat the lords Boid, Ochetree, Ruthwen treasuror of Scotland, Harris,
					Maxwell, Lindseie, Semple, and others.</p>
				<p part="N">Besides these, bishops and abbats, that is to sale, Patrike Adamson archbishop of
					S. Andrews, Cunningham (kinsman to the erle of Glencarne) bishop of Aberden,
					Boid (of bloud and kindered with the lord Boid) archbishop of Glascow, Dowglasse
					bishop of <!--<fw place="bot-right">"naw,"</fw>-->
					<pb n="689"/>
					<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"689"</fw>-->
					Mannaw, Hexburne bishop of Rosse, Robert Petcarne abbat of Dunfermeling, cheefe
					secretarie of Scotland, Coluington abbat of Cowlros, Richard Bedwell abbat of
					Holierood house; one of the councell, the abbats of Cambuskinnell and of
					Dribourgh, with Iames Maghill maister of the rolles, or clearke of the register,
					and one of the councell. These noble persons thus aiding the king, the partie of
					the male-contents was supported by manie other persons of the nobilitie: as
					Camberle erle of Argile, Gordon earle of Atholl, Sincleare earle of Cathnesse,
					Gordon earle of Southerland, Gordon earle Huntleie (who was verie yoong, of six
					yeares of age, and had his power with these earles) the earles of Mentros and
					Menteth (being both surnamed Grahams) and Kenedie earle of Casselles a child of
					three yeares old, whose strength was also ioined to these male-contents. Besides
					which earles there was to assist those male-contents Crawford shiriffe of Aire,
					Kenedie lord of Kurgenie, Kenedie lord of Blachekichen, the lords of Maxewell,
					Locheuar, Hume (being but six yeares old) which Hume lord of Colden Knolles
					(warden of the middle marches of Scotland) Alexander Hume of Maundstone, Care
					(Lord Seford, and the lord Lindseie, with the Hebburns, which wholie depended
					vpon the lord Lindseie; vnto whom in like sort, as partaking of the game
					malecontentment, were added Alexander Areskine, of Mar, vncle to the earle of
					Mar, &amp; capteine of the castell of Edenburough, and Cunningham, the lard of
					Drunwassell, capteine of Dunbritaine, with manie other persons of honour and
					strength.</p>
				<p part="N">The heads of these two factions thus set downe, it resteth now to declare who
					were the neutrals, who being but few, and as I can yet learne onelie three in
					number, so they were of no great power; aswell for that the one of them being
					Keth the earle Marshall, was a sickelie man; as for that the Hamiltons were not
					beloued of the king, nor greatlie esteemed of the other factions: and the third,
					the Leuingstons familie, wanting their head the lord of that house, being then
					in France, wherby they could not be of great power, which part soeuer they
					should support. The order of which diuision and proceeding in Scotland, comming
					afterward to the knowledge of the queene of England, who had sent Robert Bowes a
					man of good seruice hir ambassador into Scotland, she did also (tendering the
					yoong king of Scots, and as a carefull neighbour and louing godmother, fearing
					least that he might receiue iniurie by the assemblie of these malecontents,
					whose power grew to be somewhat strong) direct hir commission to the earle of
					Huntington, president of the north in England, and to the lord Hunsdon capteine
					of Berwike, they both being of bloud and aliance vnto hir maiestie. In which
					commission, she willed them to leuie an armie of footemen and horssemen to be
					imploied in those warres. All which these English lords should haue in a
					redinesse, against such time as the said maister Bowes (who, as ye haue heard
					before, had beene sent into Scotland to pacifie these troubles, and to establish
					a quiet peace and loue amongst them) should giue knowledge for their entrance
					into the Scotish dominions (vnder the conduct of the same lord of Hunsdon)
					against the power of those male-contents. Wherevpon the lord Hunsdon (hauing a
					time appointed him accordinglie, and being in order set, well furnished with men
					and munition) setting forward to execute the force of his commission, threatned
					spoile to manie places of Scotland belonging to the borderers, and burnt the
					houses of the lords there inhabiting: if they ioined themselues with the
					male-contents, as they had fullie deliberated for to doo. By reason whereof,
					they leauing their former determination, and for that present refusing to ioine
					against the king: these male-contents (doubting the sequell of their attempt,
					and how they might performe that which they had taken in hand, being now in the
					field and in armes (against the other faction) began to hearken vnto a
					pacification, and were after reconciled to the king and the other lords, about
					the two and twentith of the same moneth of August, as I haue beene informed.
					Which matter being more largelie to be discussed, because it is knowne by the
					name of the battel of Faukirke, I must for this time passe ouer, determining
					hereafter more liberallie to intreat thereof. Wherefore, falling into other
					matter, we sale, that much about this time, Iohn Lesle bishop of Rosse (who had

					at what time there were manie writings found, and amongst others certeine

				<p part="N">All which notwithstanding (though they gaue the said George occasion to mistrust
					Lesle, as an enimie to his religion) this bishop of Rosse was afterward
					dismissed, because he was furnished with the emperors passport, or safe conduct
					to come vnto him. Wherefore the duke of Bauier for his better discharge, and to
					manifest to the world that they did nothing but that, which both the present

				<p part="N">This Lesle being yet liuing, and (as I vnderstand) in great credit in France,
					possessing the place of the chancellor of Lions, is descended of an ancient
					familie, as one whose ancestors and name hath both inioied honorable titles iu
					descent, and great places of gouernement in the common-wealth of Scotland. For
					when Edgar the sonne of Edward the outlaw and kinsman to Edward the Confessor
					king of England was vexed with vniuat war, first by Harold king of England the
					son of Goodwine, &amp; then by the Norman bastard surnamed the Conqueror, which
					slue Harold and obteined the crowne of England; Edgar did priuilie take shipping
					with his mother Agatha, and his two sisters, to the end, that being now out of
					all hope euer to obteine the kingdom of England, they might direct their course
					and saile againe into Hungarie, from whense they came. But it happened by diuine
					prouidence, that being on the sea, they were grieuouslie molested with vehement
					winds, which forciblie made them forsake their appointed course, and draue them
					into the mouth of the riuer of Forth or Frith, whose landing place is yet to be
					séene, &amp; at this dale called S. Margarets hauen (after the name of hir which
					was sister to this Edgar &amp; called Margaret) whome Malcolme king of Scots
					(for the rare parts both of bodie &amp; mind wherwith she was woonderfully
					indued) did after take to wife, &amp; solemnlie crowned to the great comfort of
					the whole kingdome. Vpon which déed William the Conqueror, being more
					gréeuouslie mooued than he was before, banished all the friends of Edgar out of
					England. By occasion whereof, Lindseie, Vaus, Ramseie, Louell, and diuerse other
					men of great nobilitie came then first into Scotland to craue aid of king
					Malcolme; which persons being liberallie indued with rich possessions by the
					same Malcolme; their posteritie doo at this daie in our age flourish with great
					honor. Besides which also, at this time there came out of Hungarie with Agatha
					before touched diuerse other persons of account, as Crichton, Fodringham,
					Giffert, Manlis, Brothike, and others; amongst whome Bartholomew Lesle descended
					of noble parentage, and of great valor of mind, did with the rest appeare verie
					famous, whose sharpe wit, and excellencie of knowledge (ioined with a sound and
					strong bodie) when Malcolme the king of Scots did behold, he vsed his helpe in
					the defense of the castell of Edenburgh, and in all other weightie affaires
					which concerned the warres.</p>

				<p part="N">Out of this familie of the Lesles haue sproong and flourished manie worthie
					persons, valiantlie ressting and subduing their enimies. And amongst those, one
					Walter Lesle earle of Rosse, who afterward purchased such singular commendation
					for valor and wisedome shewed in manie battels of the emperor Lewes the second,
					&amp; Charles the fourth, against the Saracens, "Vt (one of their owne name now
					a bishop of Rosse in his historie of Scotland saieth) <note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 5. <emph>pag.</emph> 211.</note> à quodam

					Gourea, &amp; Gareocha, alijsque prouincijs munificè cumulabant) magnæ hodie
					nobilitatis virtutísque commendatione in Scotia vigent." Of whose line and name
					at this daie (as is before said) continuing in great honor, the earle of Rothos
					now liuing called Lesle dwelleth in Fife, and married the daughter of the earle
					of Gowrie or Gowrike, the same earle of Rothos being a person no lesse wise and
					honorable, than descended of ancient and honorable ancestors. But leauing that
					familie, let vs returne from whense we haue digressed.</p>
				<p part="N">The bishop of Rosse being departed from the duke of Bauier (as before you haue
					heard) in the yeare following, which was the yeare of Christ one thousand fiue
					hundred thrée score and nineteene, Amies Steward the lord of Obignie in France,
					being of the house of the <note place="marg" anchored="false">The lord of Obignie made earle of
						Leneux.</note> Stewards, and sonne to Iohn the eldest brother of Matthew
					Leneux, sometime regent of Scotland, buried at Sterling, as is before touched,
					did come into Scotland, was by the king most honorablie receiued, and aduanced
					to further honor. For the king taking from Robert Steward (whom the last yeare
					he had created earle of Leneux) the title of that <note place="marg" anchored="false">Robert
						Steward made erle of March.</note> earledome of Leneux, he now inuested this
					lord of Obignie with the same, and created him earle of Leneux, thereby more
					firmelie to bind the lord of Obignie in France to be faithfull vnto him in
					Scotland. And least he should séeme by taking the earledome from Robert Steward
					to haue wronged him, the king for recompense thereof, bestoweth vpon the said
					Robert Steward as honorable a title and earldome as the same was, for he
					inuested the same Rober with the earledome of March. Not long after which the
					king erecting the same earledome of Leneux vnto a dukedome, he did bestow that
					honor of duke vpon the said lord of Obignie, &amp; created him duke of Leneux,
					which title at this daie, his sonne being a towardlie yoong gentleman dooth most
					honorablie possesse, he being the onlie person in that countrie which dooth in
					this our age inioie that title of duke, being such an honor as was but latelie
					begun amongst them, and neuer verie plentifull in that region: for the same hath
					not yet as I for this present suppose norished at anie one time (when that title
					was rifest amongst them) thée persons adorned with that stile. Now touching the
					matter of their first creation and continuance, I thinke it not vnfit to sale
					somwhat in this place.</p>
				<p part="N">The first creation of dukes in that countrie was vsed by Robert the third of that
					name, <note place="marg" anchored="false">The first erection of dukes in Scotland.</note> whose
					right name being Iohn, was after turned vnto Robert, for doubt of euill successe
					to grow to the kingdome by a gouernor so called. For thus write the Scots as
					Lesleus hath deliuered with these spéeches: "Verùm quum ipsi nobiles
					arbitrarētur nomini inesse nescio quid <note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Lesleus
							lib.</emph> 7. <emph>pag.</emph> 264.</note>
					<note place="marg" anchored="false">To which king Iohn of England and France, he might also haue
						added one of his own countrie of Scotland Iohn Balioll the king, who was as
						infortunate in his gouernment as anie of the other.</note>

					ominis infausti, quòd reges Franciæ &amp; Angliæ, hoc nomine consignati, bello
					prehenderētur, mutato nomine Robertum vt patrem eum appellari decreuerūt. Quæ
					illorum siue in nominis obseruatione superstitio, siue in regis conseruatione
					diligentia, maioris mali regi iam impendentis augurium quoddam mihi videtur. Nam
					non multo post ex equo illi decidenti, omnia membra ita contusa fuerunt, vt
					(quòd regnandi molestias ac labores nullo modo poterat pati) Roberti comiti
					Fifensi fratri suo regni gubernationē dedere cogeretur." Which Iohn as before is
					said, hauing now obteined a new name, was the first which brought a new title of
					honor into his kingdome: for he created Dauid his eldest sonne duke of Rothseie,
					and his brother Robert (whom he had made protector of the kingdome) duke of
					Albanie, as is set downe by the same Lesleus in these words: "Tertio plus minus
					anno" (whch was about the yeare of our redemption one thousand thrée hundred
					foure score and <!--<fw place="bot-right">"téene)"</fw>-->
					<pb n="693"/>
					<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"693"</fw>-->
					thirtéene) "concilio ex omni ordinum genere Perthi habito, post alias res pro
					regni cŌmodo sapienter actas, rex Dauidem filium suum titulo ducis Rothsaiæ,
					&amp; Robertum fratrem suum quem regno administrando præfecerat, ducis Albanij
					honore ornabat: qui duo primi fuerunt in Scotia his titulis illustrati." Thus
					much he, proouing that it is not aboue one hundred foure score and thirteene
					yeares since that title came first into Scotland. Wherby it appereth that
					England since the conquest hauing dukes erected by king Edward the third, who in
					the yeare of Christ one thousand three hundred thirtie &amp; seuen, made his
					eldest sonne duke of Cornwall, hath had dukes about two hundred fortie &amp;
					nine yeres past, being fiftie and six yere before they had anie in Scotland. And
					as those two before named were the first which were inuested with the honor of
					duke in Scotland, so after the death of the same king which fell in the yeare of
					Christ one thousand foure hundred and six, in the <emph>Interregnum</emph> or
						<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 7. <emph>pag.</emph>

					the said yere of Christ one thousand foure hundred and six, vntill the yeare of
					Christ one thousand foure hundred twentie and foure) in which Iames the first
					hauing béene trained vp in England obteined the crowne, and vnder the
					protectorship of Mordacke (the sonne of the foresaid Robert the first duke of
					Albanie) to whom the gouernment of the realme of Scotland was committed after
					the death of the said Robert the third.</p>
				<p part="N">Archibald Dowglasse was the first Scot which passing the seas, &amp; seruing a
					strange prince, inioied anie such title of duke in anie forrein nation. For the
					Scots going then to aid the French against the English, the French king to
					honour the Scots and to bind them to be more faithfull vnto him, created Iohn
					Steward earle of Buquaine constable of France, &amp; aduanced the said Archibald
					Dowglasse to the honor of the dukedome of Turone; but he did not long inioie
					that great title, being shortlie after slaine at the battell of Vernoile, in the
					yere of Christ one thousand foure hundred twentie and foure. In treting of which
					battell Bucchanan, whose name may rightlie be deduced from <emph>Bucca
						vana,</emph> beyond all modestie and course of reason forgetting his
					calling, his learning and humanitie, bath spued out all his malice against the
					English nation, whereof I haue treated in my former additions to the historie of
					Scotland. Thus hauing somewhat digressed from the matter of later yeares,
					wherewith I ought to haue furnished my imperfect continuances of the annals of
					Scotland, I will returne to the lord of Obegnie, and who was at this time
					created duke of Leneux, and who occasioned me to make this discourse. Wherefore
					I will here set downe what Lesleus hath written of the first originall of that
					house in France, and of this duke of Leneux thus by the king newlie as before
					said created, the words of which Lesleus bishop of Rosse be these: "Nouam quoque
						<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 7. <emph>pag.</emph>
						271.</note> Scotorum equitum turmam Carolus 6" (king of France, which had
					the warres against the king of England, when the Scots were thus aduanced in the
					dominions of France, being meane betwéene the said yeares of Christ one thousand
					foure hundred and six, and one thousand foure hundred twentie and foure) "paulo
					ante conscripsit, quæ vulgò Scotorum armatorum cohors dicebatur. Huius primus
					dux Robertus Stuartus ex Lenoxij comitis familia ortus, domino de Aubigne
					multisque alijs terris, muneribus, honoribus, &amp; baleagijs cŌmuni populi

					fratrem iam diu possessa, præclaræ nobilitatis ac indolis iuuenis, Iohānis
					filius non paruam suorum virtutis spem de se excitans, etiam nunc hodie
					obtinet." Thus much Lesle. Beside which that Lesleus hath set downe of the first
					lord of Obegnie in France, Paulus Iouius in his booke of <emph>Empresse</emph>
					written in Italian, hath not forgotten to speake somewhat of him, where he
					setteth downe the deuise of his ensignes or armes in this sort translated by me

					lord of Obegnie in France. After which, sith I am now in discoursing of dukes of
					that countrie, and haue shewed when the first duke was made in Scotland, and who
					they were; I thinke it not vnfit for this place, to set downe a catalog of all
					such dukes of Scotland as haue come vnto my knowlege by search of histories,

					anie cause in a forren countrie; because princes (whose hands are mostlie opened
					to inrich their subiects, in whose faithfull hearts their safetie is
					principallie inclosed) do not commonlie without singular desert aduance
					strangers to them by birth in an other nation, &amp; not their natiue subiects,
					for that they are people, to whom without an especiall triall anie prince is not
					to commit anie portion of his kingdome, and much lesse anie part of his person.
					Wherefore the same being an argument of worthie desert, either for assured
					fidelitie to the person of such prince, or for the valour of seruice of the
					aduanced, when anie one is adorned with anie such title of honor, I thinke it
					not vnfit in this place to obscure the glorie of the Scots (who might impute the
					same to be maliciouslie doone by me) and to omit such of their nation as haue
					inioied the title of dukes in a forren countrie, especiallie being now in hand
					with all the dukes of Scotland.</p>
				<p part="N">And although the number of such dukes be small, as not exceeding the figure of

					Dowglasse earle of Wighton was amongst others most vnfortunatlie slaine.</p>
				<p part="N">Archibald earle Dowglasse was duke of Touraine, as I gather by the words of
					Lesleus <note place="marg" anchored="false">Archibald Dowglasse duke of Touraine.</note> touching
					this Archibalds sonne, of whom we will speake hereafter, and then set downe the
					same words of Lesleus to proue Archibald duke of Touraine, who married the earle

					now earle Dowglasse, deliuered foorth such buds of vertue, as he lent great hope
					to all men of his worthinesse and good successe, to his further honor and his
					countries benefit. But in the end their expectations were deceiued after that he
					was made duke of Touraine: for being puft vp in pride with those great honors,
					he forgot himselfe, and wrought his owne and his countries harme, whereof we
					will not now speake; but onelie set downe Lesleus words <note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Lesleus. lib.</emph> 8. <emph>pag.</emph> 292.</note> touching

					as other authors also doo, in the yeare of Christ one thousand foure hundred
					thirtie and nine, being about the third yeare of the reigne of Iames the first
					of that name king of Scotland. Which honor he did not long inioie, for in the
					yeare following being the yeare of Christ one thousand foure hundred and fortie,
					and the fourth yeare of the same king Iames; he was, for that he would neither
					obeie the gouernment of the gouernor or chancellor, bidden to a banket at
					Edenburgh castle, whereas when he and his brother Dauid were set at dinner, the
					meat was suddenlie remooued, and a buls head presented to the erle of Dowglasse,
					being in those daies a token that he should shortlie be executed. Immediatlie
					wherevpon, the said earle with his brother Dauid, &amp; Malcolme Fleming lord of
					Cummirnald were beheaded before the castle gate: so that this great honor séemed
					to those Scots which possessed the same, not much vnlike to the Seiane horse, or

					gospell, and were enimies to the Romane religion, by meanes whereof as it was
					supposed, manie princes inclining their heads to the popes obedience, embrasing
					his doctrine and resting at his disposition, expected the performance of some
					actions then to be doone by them in the territories of the aduerse part, and in
					the realmes of such princes, as not onelie opposed themselues against the popes
					doctrine, but had also drawne their necks from the yoke of his subiection, in
					matters both of ciuill gouernement and of religion. Amongst which princes, being
					commonlie termed catholiks, the duke of Guise a person of great account in
					France, tied néerelie in bloud to the imprisoned quéene, and to the yoong king
					of Scots, and supported with other princes pursses, purposed to haue set full
					foot in Scotland, and to haue obteined the whole disposition and rule of that
					king and kingdome. But God, in whose hands resteth the ordering of princes
					harts, not permitting such determinations to sort to the purposed effect, did
					for that time frustrate the execution thereof.</p>
				<p part="N">For whereas the duke of Guise should with martiall power haue inuaded, entered
					and possessed Scotland, there arose troubles and turmoiles of warres in his owne
					countrie of France, about the parts of Picardie and Dalphinée, which called him
					from the dispatch of that his former deuise, for the staieng to appease the same
					new insurrection, emploieng all his gathered forces therevnto, and encountring
					with those persons: the rigor of the same warres so weakened his strength, that
					he was not able (without some new supplie of men and monie, which could not be
					had vpon the sudden) to produce his former intent to anie effect. But yet, least
					that the same intention might not seeme altogither to haue quailed, or that he
					should be noted to haue made shew to enterprise a thing which he neither could
					nor would prosecute to the vttermost; there was somewhat by his meanes and
					furtherance attempted in Scotland, which yet in the end fell not foorth in all
					respects to answer the expected hope of good successe therin. For partlie by the
					policie of the Scots, and partlie by the support of the alies and friends to the
					king, but altogither by the vnited strength of both sorts, the Scots rid
					themselues of the same deuise, and since remained safe from the danger of the
					Guise and of his partakers.</p>
				<p part="N">After this the earle of Morton, sometime regent of Scotland, being condemned to
					die, and readie to suffer that execution which was appointed vnto him, some
					persons had conference with him about matters of great importance, on the same
					daie wherein he was to suffer, which persons so conferring with him, were Iohn
					Durie, and master Walter Bancanquell. In which discourse betwéene the earle and
					them these matters in substance amongst manie others fell foorth, in questions
					propounded by them, and in answers made by him in this sort almost word for
					word, drawne into some seuerall heads and articles, as they were deliuered vnto

								<head>THE EXAMINATIONS AND ANSWERS OF THE EARLE OF MORTON BEFORE HIS

								<p part="N"><hi rend="smallcap">FIRST</hi> he was exhorted by them that he
									should not be discouraged by his ouerthrow, in considering the
									estate whervnto he had béene once called in this world, but
									rather remembring the glorie to come, he should reioise and be
									of good comfort. Wherevnto he answered, that as concerning all
									the glorie which he had in this world, he respected it not,
									bicause he was persuaded that all worldlie honor is but vanitie,
									and the broken réed of Egypt. And as concerning the estate
									wherevnto he was brought, he thanked God for it, and was at that
									point, that he was rather content to render his life than to
									liue, bicause he knew, that as God had appointed the time for
									his death, so had he also appointed the manner thereof, séeing
									that now was the time, and this was the manner which best
									pleased his God to take him in, and therefore was content. And
									as for his life in this world, he cared not for it, in respect
									of that immortalitie, &amp; the euerlasting ioy which he looked
									for, and whereof he was assured.</p>
								<p part="N">Secondlie, being required what was his part or knowledge in the
									kings * death or murther; <note place="marg" anchored="false">Which was Henrie
										king of Scots, slain in the yeare of Christ 1566, beginning

									<pb n="699"/>
									<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"699"</fw>-->
									he answered with this attestation, that as he should answer to
									his Lord God, so he would <note place="marg" anchored="false">Dauid Richio the
										Italian, secretarie to the quéene, slaine in the yeare
										1566.</note> declare all his knowledge therein: the sum
									wherof was, that after his returne out of England, whither he
									was banished for * Dauids slaughter, he came out of Whetherbone
									to Whethingham, where the erle Bothwell was at the same time,
									with whome there was communication about the kings murther, but
									he would not consent therto. After which, opening a large
									discourse thereof, laieng the cause, the contriuing, and the
									execution of the same in great persons now liuing, and
									confessing that they vnderstood thereof, and durst not for manie
									causes reueale the same, neither to the king nor the kings
									father the earle of Leneux; he added, how that in the end he was
									by the law now of late conuicted of knowledge and concealing the
									kings murther, when as he should answer to God he had no part or
									knowledge in that matter. Furthermore, shewing that after the
									earle of Bothwell was cléered of that murther by assise, that he
									and sundrie of the nobilitie subscribed a bond with the earle of
									Bothwell, that if anie should laie the kings murther to his
									charge, he would assist him to the contrarie, and that therefore
									he subscribed to the queenes mariage with the earle Bothwell as
									sundrie other of the nobilitie did, being charged therevnto by
									the quéenes owne writing and commandement.</p>
								<p part="N">Then being required in the name of the liuing God, that séeing
									this murther of the king was one of the most filthiest acts that
									euer was doone in Scotland, and that the secrets thereof hath
									not hitherto beene opened, neither who was the chéefe dooer
									therein, or whether the king was then strangled or blowne vp
									into the aire; that he should declare if he knew anie further
									secret therein: he answered, that as he should make answer to
									God, he knew no more secrets in that matter than he had alreadie
									declared and heard, by the depositions of such as had alreadie
									suffered for it, which depositions are yet extant. Againe, being
									demanded if he knew anie presentlie about the king, which were
									dooers of that worke, by whose companie the king and
									common-wealth might be hurt: he answered that he knew none,
									neither would he accuse anie, &amp;c.</p>
								<p part="N">Thirdlie, being examined of the poisoning of the earle of
									Althiults, if he had anie act or part therein: he answered with
									good attestation, saieng; Let God neuer be mercifull vnto me, if
									euer I knew anie thing of that matter, or heard of it before it
									came to my eares by the common brute of the countrie. And being
									further demanded if he knew that maister Iohn Prouandt brought
									him anie poison; he replied that he knew no such thing, and that
									he knew nothing by maister Prouandt but honestie, to which he
									more added these speeches; Fie, fie, there is ouermuch
									filthinesse in Scotland alreadie, God forbid that vile
									practising of poisoning should enter among vs: I would not for
									all the earledome of Athuile, haue neither ministred poison to
									him, or caused it to haue béene ministred, yea if there had béen
									one hundred on my part, and but he alone, I would not haue
									stirred one heare of his head.</p>
								<p part="N">Fourthlie, being demanded if he made anie conspiracie against the
									earle of Leneux: he answered with like attestation as before,
									that he neuer thought in his heart, or once purposed anie
									conspiracie against the earle of Leneux, neither minded to him
									anie hurt in bodie or otherwise. But it greeued him that the
									earle of Leneux knew not the estate of their countrie, nor yet
									perceiued the danger of the kings person. For being therevnto
									requested by others, sundrie were brought home who were the
									kings enimies, ouerthrowers of the kingdome, and enimies to
									religion; whereby there was apparant danger to his person and
									the relme: all which he hoped to haue helped by counsell, when
									the earle of Leneux familiaritie and his should haue béene
									greater.</p>
								<p part="N">Fiftlie, being demanded whether he had anie league or dealing
									with England for the conueieng of the king or otherwise, or if
									he had anie pension of the quéene of England for that purpose,
									he answered in these words: As I shall answer to God vnder paine
									of condemnation or saluation, I neuer had anie dealings with
									England that waie: there was neuer one in Scotland or England,
									neither the quéene nor anie in hir name, that euer mooued anie
									such thing to me, so indirectlie as to conueie the king into
									England; it neuer entred into my hart, I would not for all the

									<!--<fw place="top-left">"700"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->
									profit and honor, &amp;c. And for the more cléere purgation of
									my selfe in this matter I will saie, if euer I meant but
									directlie his wealth, let God neuer be mercifull vnto me; and I
									shall neuer aske God mercie for anie thing that entred in my
									hart against the king: yea there was nothing more that I
									regarded in this life, than that he should be brought vp in
									vertue and godlinesse. And I will saie more. If I had beene as
									carefull to serue God &amp; walke in his feare, as I was to
									séeke the kings wealth, I had not béene brought to the point I
									am at this daie. And where they allege I was the quéene of
									Englands pensionarie, as I shall answer to God, I had neuer
									pension of the quéene of England in all my life. And although
									they caused the brute to go, that I should haue furnished the
									quéene of Englands souldiors now last vpon the borders, I neuer
									knew of it. And last of all, where they allege that I should
									haue bene a great dealer with England, I praise God I neuer had
									dealing with them, but for the weale publike of the king, his
									countrie, and subiects, &amp;c.</p>
								<p part="N">Sixtlie, being demanded what was his part of the enterprise of
									the castell of Sterling, he answered, that he knew nothing of it
									till it was doone; but being in Lochleuen, he receiued
									aduertisement out of the castell of Sterling, and a writing from
									the king, that he should come thither. And whereas they said,
									that he minded to kéepe the king in captiuitie there, the truth
									was, that he neuer meant to keepe him in captiuitie there or in
									anie other place. But he vnderstood by the kings owne speaking,
									that he was as frée at that time as euer he was before, or
									desired to be, for the present. And if he had knowen that his
									grace would haue gone to anie other place, where greater
									libertie had bin, he would gladlie haue gone with him.</p>
								<p part="N">Seuenthlie, being laid to his charge, that he was a great
									hinderance of the matters and authortie of the bishops, &amp;c:
									when he might haue doone much good for the furtherance of Gods
									glorie &amp; aduancement of his gospell, both in the time of his
									gouernement, and since: his answer was, that concerning the
									religion and doctrine as then it was preached and professed in
									Scotland, he alwaies meant well in his hart to it, and
									acknowledged it to be the verie truth of God; insomuch that
									rather than anie hurt should haue come vnto the religion, he
									would haue spent his life and goods in the defense, like as now
									he was contented to die in the constant profession thereof. But
									indéed as concerning some things in policie of the church, as
									the state of the bishops, and such like, which were in question
									betwéene him and the church, he did therein according to his
									knowledge, and follow the opinion which he thought to be best at
									that time, in consideration of the estate of all things as they
									were. Howbeit he would not stand in defense of those things
									which he then did, but yet he would make this protestation, that
									as he should answer to God, he did nothing in those matters
									either of contempt, malice, or enuie; but if there were anie
									things doone amisse, it was of ignorance, and for lacke of
									better knowledge; and if he had knowen better, he would haue
									doone otherwise, being now purposed at the last to haue holpen
									them so farre as he might.</p>
								<p part="N">Eightlie, he was desired in the name of God, not to stand in his
									owne innocencie, but plainelie to confesse his sinnes to Gods
									glorie, and to thinke, that howsoeuer it be that men haue doone
									in this life, yet God had alwaies before him whereof he might be
									worthie of this and more: wherevnto he yéelded this speech;
									Howsoeuer it be that men haue doone, I commit them to God and
									their owne consciences. But I acknowledge indéed, that God hath
									alwaies doone iustlie to me, and not onlie iustlie but
									mercifullie also, because amongst all the other sinners I
									confesse my selfe to be one of the greatest and filthiest
									abusers of my bodie in the pleasures of the flesh; and also to
									haue giuen my selfe so ouermuch to the world, to the pleasures
									thereof, and to other sinnes, that God might iustlie laie it to
									my charge, in that I expressed not the fruits of my profession
									in my life and conuersation as I ought to haue doone, for which
									I beséech God to be mercifull vnto me. And indéed now I
									acknowledge the great mercie of God in this, that amongst all
									the benefits which he hath bestowed vpon me, one of the chiefest
									is, that he hath in this my last trouble giuen me space and
									leasure to repent me of my sinnes, and to be at a point with
									God. In which <!--<fw place="bot-right">"trouble"</fw>-->
									<pb n="701"/>
									<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"701"</fw>-->
									trouble also I haue found farre greater comfort than euer I
									could find before, because I haue thereby concluded thus with my
									selfe, that if God should haue spared my life, and deliuered me
									out of this trouble, I should then haue cast awaie all the cares
									of the world, the pleasures of the flesh, the delights of
									earthlie things, and declared my selfe to serue my God in all
									kind of quietnesse and simplicitie. And if it shall please God
									to take me in this trouble, I am concluded also to be content
									therewith, being alwaies assured of the mercies of God. And for
									that cause I doo now thanke God that I find my selfe at this
									point, that I am rather content to die than to liue, and that I
									shall not sée the miseries to come : for I will assure you that
									I think this to be the most acceptable time that euer God could
									haue taken me in, because I perceiue and sée such miseries and
									confusions to insue, that I thanke God that I shall not sée
									them. And you who doo feare God, and liue after me, when you
									shall sée these things, you will wish to be where I shall be,
									that is, with him.</p>
								<p part="N">Ninethlie, being demanded what he thought of the forme of
									iudgement vsed against him, what his opinion therof was, whether
									he thought anie wrong doone vnto him or no, &amp;c: he answered,
									I would be verie loth to find fault or blame the noble men which
									haue taken themselues vpon their consciences to condemne me, but
									I will remit them to God and their owne consciences; yet I am
									mooued to speake somewhat fréelie in this matter which is this.
									I saw such parciall dealing against me, that it hath béene all
									one to me, if I had beene as innocent as saint Stephan, or that
									I had béene as giltie as Iudas was: for I perceiued there was
									nothing sought but my life, howsoeuer things had béene, which
									appeareth in this, that no exception of anie person which was to
									passe vpon my assise could be admitted: for I required the earle
									of Argile to purge himselfe of parciall counsell giuen to the
									pursuer my accuser; he purged himselfe indeed, but I knew the
									contrarie, that he gaue parciall counsell to him. Likewise the
									lord of Wanthon, the lord of Seiton, and such others, who were
									knowen to be my enimies, (notwithstanding lawfull exception)
									were put vpon my quest. In consideration wherof I can not but be
									persuaded of one thing, which it behooueth me to communicat vnto
									you, and it is thus. I perceiue it is not my life that they
									séeke onelie, but they who are authors of my death haue some
									other purpose in hand, which they per– ceiue will not be doone,
									except I and such other which doo fauor the good cause, were
									taken out of the waie. Wherefore I can not but suspect that I
									haue béene so handled, and that such as héereafter shall be put
									therevnto, may haue a more plaine waie to doo their turne or
									intent: and I praie God that they which are to liue behind me
									sée not the practise thereof, but I feare it sore. And therefore
									in respect of this apparant danger of the common cause, I will
									giue my counsell to the king my maister, and wish you in the
									name of God to beare it to him, the summe whereof is this. I
									perceiue that they which haue béene the kings foes and enimies,
									are brought into credit &amp; court, and they who haue béene the
									mainteiners of his crowne &amp; good friends, are discredited
									and misliked of. And likewise such as are knowen to be papists,
									and suspected to be enimies to the religion, are ouer familiar
									and great in credit with his maiestie, which surelie can not be
									without great danger to the religion, and hurt to his estat. For
									which cause I admonish him in the name of God to beware of them,
									and to seeke a remedie thereof. And as he hath bene brought vp
									in the feare of God, and companie of good men, so to continue
									therein, and not to go backe, or else he hath doone with it for
									euer. For I tell you what mooueth me to speake thus, which is,
									that the state of religion in this countrie appeared neuer to be
									in such danger, and that for this cause. I beere saie there is a
									dealing put in practise betwéene France and England, and
									Monsieurs marriage with the quéene is like to be feared; if
									France and England bind togither, and that marriage go forward,
									you may easilie vnderstand, that the one of them will persuade
									the other to their religion, &amp;c.</p>
								<p part="N">Tenthlie, being required to giue his counsell to the earle of
									Angus, and to shew him what was meetest to be doone, seeing
									presentlie he was in great trouble, he answered : I dare giue
									him no counsell, and I will tell you whie; to bid him come in,
									partlie I dare not, all men may sée in what danger he is
									although he now come in : and to counsell him to abide <!--<fw place="bot-right">"foorth"</fw>-->
									<pb n="702"/>
									<!--<fw place="top-left">"702"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->
									foorth I dare not, for then he shall loose the kings fauour for
									euer, himselfe and his he. ritage, friends and all; and
									therefore the best counsell that I can giue him in this matter
									is, that he make all meanes possible to purchase the kings fauor
									againe, and to see if he may haue anie assurance of his life,
									and that he may serue his God and his king trulle, and submit
									himselfe, and all that he hath to his maiesties goodwill: he
									hath doone nothing yet, but it may be amended. I saie no more,
									the Lord giue him his spirit to follow that which is best.</p>
								<p part="N">Elenenthlie being required to declare what was the summe of that
									admonition, which Iohn Knokes gaue him before he accepted the
									regiment, when he came vnto him a little before his departure,
									he answered: I shall tell you as far as I can remember. First,
									he asked of me if I knew anie thing of the kings murder, I
									answered in deed I knew nothing of it. Then he said vnto me,
									Well God hath beautified you with manie benefits which he hath
									not giuen to euerie man, for he hath giuen to you riches,
									wisedome and friends, and now he is to prefer you to the
									gouernement of this realme : and therefore in the name of God I
									charge you, to vse these benefits aright, and better in time to
									come than you haue doone in times past; first to Gods glorie, to
									the furtherance of the gospell, to the mainteinance of the
									church of God &amp; of his ministers, next for the weale of the
									king, his realme and true subiects : which if you shall not doo,
									God shall spoile you of these benefits, and your end shall be
									ignominie &amp; shame. Then being inquired if he said true or
									no, he answered : I haue found it true, and yet I doubt not but
									the Lord will be mercifull vnto me.</p>
								<p part="N">Twelfelie, being demanded for what cause he held some of the
									neighbours of Edenburgh in ward, he answered: Surelie I meant no
									euill to those men, but it was doone in this respect: we had the
									matter of Bulzoine then in hand, and I was informed that they
									were hinderers therof, for which cause I thought it best at that
									time to put them in ward for a while vntill the turne had béene
									doone. And if I did them anie wrong, I craue forgiuenesse of
									them as I forgiue all men.</p>
								<p part="N">Thirteenthlie, being required to declare if hée knew before hand
									that he should be accused of this matter or no, he answered: I
									was aduertised in déed, and might haue escaped, but I would not,
									trusting alwaie vnto mine innocencie, and therefore supposed
									that they would not condemne me vpon such a thing. After this,
									the said earle with the foresaid Iohn Durie and Walter
									Balcanquall did togither call to God by earnest praier, which
									being ended the earle said vnto vs (meaning the said Durie and
									Balcanquall who as I gather were the penners of this matter) I
									thanke you hartilie for your comfort which you haue offered to
									me, for now in déed is greatest need of comfort, and therefore
									as you haue begun, I praie you to continue with me: for now that
									I am come to the knowledge of mine owne sinnes, there resteth
									onlie two things which I craue of you, that is first that you
									will shew vnto me some kind of argument, whereby I maie be
									comforted against naturall death, because the flesh is fearefull
									and weake; whose desire we trauelled to satisfie by long
									conference, which is too long to reherse in euerie point, yet
									the summe of that was thus. It was said vnto him that there were
									thrée things chéefelie which might make him assured of the
									mercie of God in Christ: first the innumerable and comfortable
									promises of God conteined in his word, wherevnto it behooued him
									alwaies to leane. Secondlie the example of Gods mercie practised
									towards his owne seruants, albeit they haue beene great sinners;
									as appeared in Dauid, Magdalen, Peter, and the théefe, &amp;c.
									Thirdlie the often experiences of Gods mercies from time to
									time, which he had found in his owne person, being a light to
									assure him of his mercie. In the end he answered to this,
									saieng: I know it to be true, for since I past to Dunbarton I
									haue read the fiue bookes of Moses, Iosue, the Iudges, and now I
									am in Samuell, and will tell you what I haue found there. I sée
									that the mercie of God is woonderfull, and alwaies inclined to
									haue pittie vpon his owne people: for there it appeareth that
									although he punished them so oft as they sinned; yet as soone as
									they turned againe to him, he was mercfull vnto them, and when
									they sinned againe he punished them, and as often as they
									repented he was mercifull againe, and therefore Iam assured,
									that albeit that I haue offended against my God, yet he will be
									mercifull vnto me. Also further in this point it was said vnto
									him, that in <!--<fw place="bot-center">"4"</fw>--><!--<fw place="bot-right">"case"</fw>-->
									<pb n="703"/>
									<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"703"</fw>-->
									case sathan should trauell to discourage him in consideration of
									the iustice of God on the one part, and of his sinnes on the
									other part, we exhorted him to the contrarie, to be of good
									courage, and that in respect of the verie selfe same iustice of
									God, which will not suffer him twise to take paiment for one
									thing, as we know in the common dealing of men: for he that is a
									iust man will not twise demand paiment of that whereof he was
									alredie paid, for sith Christ died for our sinnes, and paid the
									vttermost farthing that God could craue, he cannot laie our
									sinnes vnto our charge being satisfied in Christ, because his
									iustice will not suffer him twise to take paiment for one thing.
									Vnto this the earle answered, Truelie it is verie good.</p>
								<p part="N">And concerning the naturall feare of death, we exhorted him to be
									alwaies exercised in the consideration of the glorie, ioie, and
									felicitie of the life to come, which would be the onlie waie to
									swallow vp the feare of this naturall death. Wherevnto he
									answered, I praise. God I doo so. This being thus doone, and he
									hauing in his hand a pretie treatise of the meditation of death,
									written by Bradford (which he said that he had gotten from the
									ladie Ormeston before he went into ward, and for that cause
									before he came foorth of prison againe gaue it to maister
									Lawson, desiring him to deliuer it to the said ladie againe) he
									willed maister Walter to read him a péece thereof, which he did,
									in which reading (hauing sundrie conferences vpon the thing
									read) both he and we found great comfort, in so much that he
									said; I protest now that I heare with other eares than I did
									before. Wherewith being called to breakefast, he earnestlie
									desired vs to take part with him (as we did) at what time he eat
									his meat with great chéerefulnesse, as all the companie saw, and
									as appeared by these his words: I sée there is great difference
									(said he) betwéene a man which is troubled with the cares of the
									world, and him which is frée from them, the which I haue found
									by these two former nights: for before mine accusation, I could
									not in things find anie rest by reason of cares which I had,
									because I was to be accused vpon the morrow; and therefore being
									carefull to answer euerie point that should be laid vnto my
									charge I could not sleepe: but this night, after that I was
									condemned, and knew that I should die, I was at a point with my
									selfe, and nothing of this world, nor care of this life, but
									cast my onelie care vpon. God, and I praise God I neuer slept
									better in my life than I did this night. Then he said vnto the
									steward, William you can beare me record of this; who answred,
									It is true my lord.Then master Walter said vnto him, My lord I
									will drinke to you vpon a condition. vpon this condition my
									lord, that you and I shall drinke together in the kingdome of
									heauen, of that immortall drinke which shall neuer suffer vs to
									thirst againe. Wherevnto the earle answered, Truelie I will
									pledge you master Walter on the same condition. After which he
									said, Iohn Durie, now Iohn I will drinke to you vpon the same
									condition. This thus ended for that time, and thanks being giuen
									to God, the earle passed againe to his chamber, at what time
									master lames Lawson came to him, with whom he considered the
									substance of all other things againe. After this we departed
									from him.</p>
								<p part="N">Then at afternoone we came to him againe, with sundrie of the
									brethren of the ministerie, as master lames Lawson, master
									Robert Poinct, Dauid Fargasone, master Dauid Hensa, Iohn Brand,
									master lames Garmichiel, and master Iohn Dauison, whom the earle
									receiued verie louinglie in his arms, and said to him; Master
									Iohn you wrote a little booke in deed, but trulie I meant neuer
									euill towards you in my mind, forgiue me, and I forgiue you:
									vpon which words master Iohn was mooued with teares. Then all
									the brethren being present, the earle reported againe the chéefe
									substance of all the things whereof before he spake, being
									demanded thereof point by point, as their testification of this
									matter subscribed by them at more length will declare. After
									which the earle was called to his dinner about two of the clocke
									in the after noone, who being thus at his dinner, the brethren
									of the ministerie were informed that there was iniust report
									made of his profession to the king, &amp; that he should haue
									confessed much otherwise than he did, whereby the king might
									haue a worse opinion of him. Wherefore they thought good to send
									down some before his suffering to informe his maiestie of the
									truth of his confession; which persons so sent were Dauid
									Fargasone, Iohn <!--<fw place="bot-right">"Durie,"</fw>-->
									<pb n="704"/>
									<!--<fw place="top-left">"704"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->
									Durie, and Iohn Brand, who before his death did largelie tell
									the simple truth of his confession (as it was made) vnto the
									kings maiestie. At their returning the earls kéeper required him
									that he would come foorth to the scaffold, wherevnto the earle
									answered; Sith they haue thus troubled me ouermuch this daie
									with worldlie things, I supposed that they should haue giuen me
									one nights leisure to haue aduised my selfe with my God. Then
									the kéeper said, All things are redie now my lord, and I thinke
									they will not staie. The earle replied, I am redie also I praise
									God: and so comfortable praier being made, the earle passed
									downe to the gate, minding to go directlie to the scaffold; but
									the earle of Arrane staled him, brought him backe againe to the
									chamber, and willed him to staie vntill his confession should be
									put in writing &amp; subscribed with his owne hand. Wherevnto
									the ministers which were present answered, and the earle also
									answered: Naie my lord, I praie you trouble me no more with
									these things, for now I haue another thing to muse vpon, which
									is to prepare me for my God. And sith I am at a point to go to
									my death, I can not write in the estate wherein I now am; and
									all these honest men can testifie what I haue spoken in that
									matter. With which answer the earle of Arrane being satisfied,
									he said to him, My lord you will be reconciled with me, for I
									haue doone nothing vpon anie particular quarell against you. The
									earle of Morton replied, It is no time now to remember quarels,
									I haue no quarell to you nor to anie other, I forgiue you and
									all others as I would you forgaue me. And so after with a good
									courage he passed to the scaffold, who being vpon the scaffold,
									repeated in few words the substance of the things before
									confessed, &amp;c: adding some exhortation to the people which
									he spake not before, in this sort.</p>
								<p part="N">Sure I am the king shall loose a good seruant this daie, and so
									he exhorted the people, saieing: I testifie before God, that as
									I professe the gospell which this daie is taught and professed
									in Scotland: so also now I willinglie laie downe my life in the
									persecution thereof. And albeit I haue not walked according
									therevnto as I ought, yet I am assured that God will be
									mercifull vnto me: and I charge you all in God which are
									professors of the gospell, that you continue the true professing
									and mainteining thereof to your power, as I would haue done, God
									willing with my life, lands and goods as long as I had liued:
									which if you doo, I assure you God shall be mercifull vnto you;
									but if you doo it not, be sure the vengeance of God shall fall
									vpon you, both in bodie and soule. As concerning all the rest of
									the words which he had vpon the scaffold, he spake them in
									effect and more amplie before. When all these speaches were
									ended vpon the scaffold, a comfortable praier was made by
									maister Iohn Lawson, during the time of which praier, the erle
									Morton laie groueling vpon his face before the place of
									execution, his bodie making great reboundings with sighes and
									sobs, being euident signes of the inward and mightie working of
									the spirit of God, as all they which were present and knew what
									it was to be earnestlie moued in praier, might easilie
									perceine.</p>
								<p part="N">The praier being ended, and sundrie comming to him before his
									death, he did most louinglie receiue them; who after he had
									taken vs all by the hand that were about him, &amp; bidden vs
									farewell in the Lord, he passed both constantlie, patientlie,
									and humblie (without feare of death) to the place of execution,
									and laid his necke vnder the axe being vnbound. And there
									maister Walter putting him alwaies in mind to call vpon God; the
									earle continuallie cried vntill his head was striken off, Lord
									lesus receiue my spirit, Lord Iesus receiue my spirit: which
									words he spake euen while the axe fell on his necke. Now
									whatsoeuer he had béene before, he constantlie died the seruant
									of God. And howsoeuer it be that his foes alleged, that as he
									liued proudlie, so he died proudlie; the charitable seruants of
									God could perceiue nothing in him but all kind of humilitie in
									his death: insomuch that we are assured, that his soule is
									receiued into the ioies and glories of the heauens; and we praie
									God, that they which are behind, may learne by his example to
									die in the true feare of God our Lord. </p>

				<p part="N">¶ Thus far the confession and death of the earle Morton, penned by such of the

					manner of penning it; but onelie in some few places of some part of the matter,
					the which I haue purposelie omitted, because it conteined the affaires of state,
					and the accusation of diuerse persons now liuing; both which are neither néedful
					to be knowne to the common people, nor méete to be opened to others, thereby to
					bring those in question vpon a report, whereof there is no further hold to be
					had, than there was hate or loue betwéene the accuser &amp; the accused.
					Wherefore leauing the same discourse of the death of the earle (which <note place="marg" anchored="false">The time when earle Morton was beheadded.</note> fell vpon the
					second daie of fune in the towne of Edenburgh) in that sort, penned by those of
					the presbyterie, to stand vpon the support of it selfe, I will descend to other
					matters.</p>
				<p part="N">This earle Morton maried the old earle of Mortons yoongest daughter, who being
					halfe an idiot brought foorth no issue to this earle: but he notwithstanding,
					least he should die issulesse, left behind him two sonnes, vnlawfullie begotten.
					Shortlie after the death of which erle, Thomas Randulph esquier being sent
					ambassador from the quéene of England, entered into <note place="marg" anchored="false">Thomas
						Randulph sent ambassador into Scotland.</note> Scotland, whom (being
					honorablie interteined) I will leaue there to dispatch the effect of his
					commission, and fall to that which happened. After the death of this earle
					Morton, in the winter following there was a parlement called, at what time manie
					noblemen were created, as Ruthwen was made earle of Gowrie, Robert Steward base
					brother to Marie the imprisoned quéene of Scots was aduanced to the honor and
					title of the earldome of Orkneie, the lord Maxwell was made erle Morton, and
					Iames Steward was created earle of Arrane, the manner of obteing which earldome
					of Arrane by the said Steward being extraordinarilie procured, séemeth to me not
					to be forgotten: and therefore I will set it downe as I haue had intelligence
					thereof, in this sort following. The old earle of Arrane (the duke of
					Chateleraults eldest sonne <note place="marg" anchored="false">Iames Steward created earle of
						Arrane.</note> being lunatike, and first committed to the custodie of his
					said brother the lord of Arbroth)was after taken from that his tutor, and set
					ouer to lames Steward to haue the ouersight of his person, and the ordering of
					his liuing. Which lames Steward being by nature and experience subtill witted,
					and by authoritie and the kings fauor in great credit; found meanes partlie by
					policie, partlie by persuasion, and partlie by flatterie, to wring from the
					lunatike earle of Arrane, a grant and departure of all his right, title, and
					honor, to the lands and earledome of Arrane. Which when he had obteined of the
					said lunatike earle (who knew not what he did) he foorthwith came to the said
					parlement or councell house, or place of the assemblie of the nobilitie,
					bringing with him the grant of the earle of Arrane: wherby he had infested this
					Steward with the lands and countrie of Arrane. Which matter being fullie
					vnderstood there by the nobilitie, supposing vpright dealing to haue furthered
					the purchase of this earldome by Steward, did then by the decrée and the kings
					consent, establish, and also inuest him in the lands, &amp; with the title of
					the earledome of Arrane; which he obteined by such meanes as are before touched.
					Not vnlike vnto the course which Mordacke (made gouernor of Scotland, in the
					yeare of Christ one thousand foure hundred and six) sometime vsed for the
					obteining of the earledome of Rosse, from the daughter and heire of Alexander
					Lesle, intituled to the same earldome: the maner whereof I will here set downe
						<emph>Verbatim</emph> taken out of Lesleus historie of Scotland, which
					deliuered he same in these words.</p>
				<p part="N">"Breui post tempore Donaldus insularis Rossæ comitatum vendicans, Hebridianos ad

				<p part="N">Thus hauing expressed the words and verses of Roger Wall, which in Latine termed
					some hundred yeares passed (as you haue heard before) the name of Summerset by
					the words of <emph>Aesiatis sedes,</emph> I haue trulie béene the willinger to
					set downe the same by waie of digression (besides the former declared causes
					which mooued me thereto) for that I would not suffer so worthie a man as that
					Iohn Summerset was to be buried in obliuion. And for that I would in some part
					(as anie occasion may serue therefore) make this worke of Roger Wall more common
					to the world, being onelie now in the hands of one painefull antiquarie.
					Wherefore in that sort, leauing our Englishmen, let vs returne to the affaires
					of Scots and Scotland: intreating first of some thing doone by them in the low
					countries, where one Steward <note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Surius in comende reb. in
							orbe histor. pa.</emph> 1062.</note> a Scot, hauing had charge of men in
					some part of the low countries of Flanders, Zeland, and Holland, vnder William
					of Nassaw earle of Aurange, did now fall from the states of that countrie,
					emploie all his force on the king of Spaines side, and went to assist the prince
					of Parma (the deputie of king Philip in those parts) because the states did not
					paie to him and his soldiors their due stipend and wages for the wars. At what
					time also the garison of Bruxels were for the like cause in an vprore. But some
					portion of monie being offered vnto them, they were for that time somewhat
					pacified. All which notwithstanding, one certeine Scot, called Lichféeld, &amp;
					surnamed Semple, being capteine of the garison of Lire, and long vnpaied his
					sallarie, for those warres did in vaine manie times demand that monie <note place="marg" anchored="false">The Spaniards obteine Lire by a stratagem deuised by the
						Scots.</note> due vnto him. Wherevpon, imagining with himselfe how he might
					deceiue Hietfield the gouernour of the citie, as they had beguiled him in
					deteining of his due, he deuised with a new stratagem to bring this towne into
					the subiection of Philip king of Spaine. Wherefore, feining himselfe that he
					would in the middest of the night with his people go foorth to bring home some
					great bootie for his and the townes benefit, he departed the towne, &amp; late
					in the night gathered togither a great preie of catell, horsses, oxen, kine,
					sheepe, and such <!--<fw place="bot-right">"like,"</fw>-->
					<pb n="710"/>
					<!--<fw place="top-left">"710"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->
					like, with some prisoners of the kings part. All which he brought to the towne
					gate of Lire, and then commanded the gates to be opened vnto him, whereby they
					with their bootie might enter all at once. But the porter fearing at such time
					of night to set the gates full abroad, onelie opened a little wicket or doore,
					thereby to receiue Semple into the towne. Which thing Semple then perceiuing
					(&amp; not finding all things to answer his expectation) feined that the enimies
					were hard at their backs, would kill them all, and recouer their bootie, vnlesse
					he did spéedilie open the great gate, through the same to receiue them into the
					towne all at once. Then the porter beléeuing all this to be true, foorthwith set
					open the great gates of the citie; which doone, the Scot entereth thereat, slue
					those which kept the watch, possessed the towne, &amp; into the same receiued
					the kings souldiors, which were not farre behind, but secretlie laie in wait
					expectiug the successe of this deuise. By which meanes the Spaniards and their
					followers first woone the market place, and the next date after the calends of
					August reduced the whole towne of Lire vnder their owne subiection: the same
					Lire being a place well fensed, and set in such a conuenient soile, that it
					would prohibit all passage and cariage to come to Antwerpe, Mecheline and
					Bruxels.</p>
				<p part="N">After this, much about the beginning of September, monsieur de la Mot was sent
					from <note place="marg" anchored="false">Ambassador from the French into Scotland.</note> Henrie
					the third the French king ambassador into Scotland, the outward effect of whose
					commission was to renew and conclude the old league of amitie betwixt those two
					nations, as it had béene long continued betwéene them in times past, which
					doone, he returned, well accepted by his French master. After which in like sort
					the king of Scots sent the lord <note place="marg" anchored="false"><date instant="false">1583.</date></note>
					<note place="marg" anchored="false">Ambassador from the Scot to the French.</note> Seton
					ambassador into France to the same king Henrie, which lord came to Paris in the

					wait laid (as was supposed) to the end that he might haue béene intercepted by
					some of his enimies, before he should haue atteined the presence of the king his
					maister.</p>
				<p part="N">But now, as a litle before I haue set downe the exploits doone by the Scots in
					the low countries of their owne nation, so I thinke it not amisse to adde to the
					same somewhat doone by a Scot héere in England, the summe whereof is after this
					manner. One William Creicton <note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 6.
							<emph>pag.</emph> 210.</note> a Scot by birth, and a Iesuit by
					profession, which name of Creicton first came into Scotland in the yeare of
					Christ one thousand threescore and six out of Hungarie amongst others with
					Agatha, the Mother of Maud the wife to Malcoime king of Scots, hauing trauelled
					the most part of Europe, had conference with one William Parrie an Englishman,
					by wafe of discourse and argument touching such matter of treason as concerned
					the death of the quéene of England. After which (Parrie being returned into
					England in lanuarie following) this Creicton also, not tarrieng long behind him,
					did come from the parts of beyond the seas to take his iornie towards Scotland,
					who determining to passe through England, arriued here, was apprehended, &amp;
					committed prisoner to the Tower of London, in such sort as before you haue <note place="marg" anchored="false">Creicton a Scot committed to prison in England.</note> heard
					that lohn Lesle bishop of Rosse was staied by the duke of Bauier vpon suspicion,
					that the same bishop had dealt with the enimies of that prince against the state
					of his countrie. The cause wherefore the said Creicton was so committed, was for
					that he had about him diuers plots for inuasions of this our realme of England.
					When he was thus prisoner in the Tower, William Parrie was after for the same
					treason apprehended, examined, committed also to the Tower, and finallie
					executed on the second daie of March in the yere of our Lord one thousand fiue
					hundred foure score &amp; foure. In the Februarie before which execution, sir
					Francis Walsingham knight, principall secretarie to hir maiestie of England,
					came to the Tower, examined the said Creicton and dealt with him, to vnderstand
					if the said Parrie had euer had conference with him in the parts beyond the seas
					touching that question, whether it were lawfull to kill hir maiestie of England
					or not, the which at that time the said Creicton called not to his remembrance;
					yet afterwards vpon better consideration thereof it fell into his mind, where,
					when, &amp; on what occasion such spéech had passed betweene the said Parrie and
					him. Wherevpon the twentith daie of Februarie, in the yeare of Christ one
					thousand fiue hundred foure score and foure, during the time that Parrie also

					<pb n="711"/>
					<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"711"</fw>-->
					in the Tower, this Creicton wrote to maister secretarie Walsingham a voluntarle
					letter penned all with his owne hand, which being alreadie set downe in the
					historie of England is needlesse here to be repeated. Wherefore hauing thus said
					somewhat of this prisoner, we will leaue him still remaining in the same state,
					expecting some folowing successe of libertie to come to him, and returne our pen
					to the countrie of Scotland, thereof to set downe such occurrents as happened
					from this time.</p>
				<p part="N">In March was renewed a great &amp; old contention betwéene the lord Maxwell earle
					Morton <note place="marg" anchored="false">A contention betweene the earle Morton and the lard
						Iohnstane.</note> warden of the west marches of Scotland, and the lard of
					Iohnstane; the occasion of which new dissention procéeded of an old enmitie
					begun in the time of Dowglasse earle Morton beheaded, as before in the yeare of
					Christ one thousand fiue hundred eightie and one, touching the receiuing of the
					same wardenship. In which hurlie burlie the lard of Iohnstane behaued himselfe
					verie rigorouslie against the lord Maxwell, in blowing vp with gunpouder the
					lockes of the castell of Lochmaben. Which dissention secretlie after the death
					of Dowglasse earle Morton, continuing betwéene the lord Maxwell and Iohnstane,
					with further increase of malice, they in this yeare sought a fresh reuenge
					thereof, sith the lord Iohnstane had not (before this) either power or meanes to
					incounter with the lord Maxwell. But now the ladie Iohnstane (being verie
					familiar and fauored with and of Iames Steward earle of Arrane) obteined of the
					king some succors of men of warre against the lord <note place="marg" anchored="false">Ladie
						Iohnstane hath aid of the king.</note> Maxwell earle Morton, hir husband (as
					was supposed) not being able otherwise to make his part good against the same
					earle. Wherevpon capteine Lamie and capteine Granestane were sent with two
					companies of hackbuts vnto the reliefe of the lard of Iohnstane. Who being thus
					furnished, did in the kings name raise the nobilitie and countrie thereabouts to
					assist him with their power: which being had, he meant and therefore went to
					haue ioined with the said two capteins Lamie and Granestane. But as man
					purposeth, and God disposeth quite contrarie to our determination: so the lard
					Iohnstane was disappointed of that méeting; for the earle Morton (whose heedfull
					watch was not idle in learning out the deuises of his enimies, a néedfull
					policie for all such as intend to bring great actions to effect) hauing
					intelligence by some of his friends tendering his safetie, of this determination
					and preparation of the lard Iohnstane, and wiselie (as behooued him) seeing what
					danger might rise vnto him, if their two forces met, which would rise to a
					greater number than he were able to incounter, and iudging it best in the
					beginning to prouide for mischiefe, and to stop their passage, did prepare to
					preuent all their deuises, and for that cause sent his base brother Robert
					Maxwell capteine of Langhoine with some horssemen and footmen vnder the conduct
					of <note place="marg" anchored="false">Robert Maxwell base brother to earle Morton sent against
						capteine Lamie.</note> Iames Fraiser brother to the lord of Fullorth, which
					Robert meeting on Cranford mere with the foresaid capteins Lamie and Cranestane,
					before that they had ioined with the lard Iohnstane, gaue the charge vpon them,
					and that so fiercelie as they ouerthrew the whole strength of his enimies, slue
					Lamie, tooke Cranestane prisoner, and so handled the matter that all <note place="marg" anchored="false">Capteine Lamie &amp; Cranestane ouerthrowen.</note> the rest
					were taken or slaine except some few, who sought their liues by the benefit of
					flieng. After which victorie the report thereof came to the lard Iohnstane, who
					desirous to be reunged thereof, vsed the helpe of other meanes when he perceued
					that force would not preuaile. And for that cause assembling such power as he
					had, he vsed the strength of one element against an other, of the highest
					against the lowest, of the heauen against the earth, of the fire against
					mettall, and of burning against fighting. For with all spéed he hastened to the
					lands of the earle Morton, which he cruelie spoiled, and in the same did burne
					certeine houses and other places belonging to the earle, as Comers trées,
					Duncoll, Cowhill, and such like. Wherevpon the earle Morton, who in like sort
					did not neglect his owne cause, but as opportunitie serued, sought the requitall
					thereof, did with the like furie, but with more hurt, enter the lands of
					Iohnstane, vtterlie spoiled them, and yet not so satisfied, committed to the
					fire both the castels of Louchhouse and Louchwood belonging to <note place="marg" anchored="false">The castels Louchhouse and Louchwood burnt.</note> Iohnstane,

					<!--<fw place="top-left">"712"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->
					vnto further pursute, and determining fullie to reuenge himselfe vpon Iohnstane,
					and his followers, forced the lard Iohnstane himselfe to flie his furie.
					Wherefore he fled to a strong <note place="marg" anchored="false">The lard Iohnstane forced to
						flie.</note> house called the Bonshaw castell belonging to Edward Yrwine of
					the Bonshaw, whome the earle pursued, and besieged in the same place, at what
					time he so battered the castell with artillerie, that the house was almost
					gotten. Which being perceiued of those within, not able to make further
					resistance, they fell to parlée, and so to composition; whereby in the end the
					matter was wholie compounded and ended betwéen them, by the mediation and
					furtherance of the lord Scroope of England, with certeine conditions to be
					performed as <note place="marg" anchored="false">The lord Scroope compounded the contention
						betwéene earle Morton and the lard Iohnstane.</note> well on the part of the
					earle as of the lard Iohnstane. But the coles of inward griefe being couered
					with cold ashes of outward reconciliation, did not long lie couered, but in the
					end began afresh to shew their fire. For the lard Iohnstane falling from the
					said accord, vpon what occasion I know not, either for cause giuen by the earle
					Morton, or for an euill disposition in himselfe, or for both, they burst foorth
					againe into the like conflicts &amp; part taking, which in the end falling to
					the worst, for the lard Iohnstane, he was taken betwéen <note place="marg" anchored="false">The
						lard Iohnstane taken.</note> Tinwall and the Warden ditches (where he was
					laid in ambush to haue performed some action against the said Robert Maxwell
					comming from the towne of Domfreies to Laugham from the earle Morton his
					brother) by William Carrutheris (baron of Holmence and capteine of the kings
					castell named Traife) being by the earle Morton appointed to incounter with the
					said lard Iohnstane: which this baron was the more willing to doo, because he
					entirelie loued the earle, and had alwaies from the beginning followed the
					earles faction.</p>
				<p part="N">These things thus performed and the successe therof comming to the kings
					knowledge, <note place="marg" anchored="false">The king displeased with earle Morton for the
						cause of the lard Iohnstane.</note> he grew so heauilie displeased with the
					earle Morton, that he was scarse able to susteine the kings displeasure, by
					reason that the earle attempted these things against the kings mind, when the
					king had supported the lard Iohnstane with men and weapons. But the kings
					displeasure onlie growing against the earle, was partlie for that the earle of
					Arrane did bitterlie exasperat the cause against him, and partlie by the
					persuasion &amp; lamentation of the ladie of Iohnstane, whereof the last was
					enimie to the earle, as of dutie she ought in respect of hir husband, and the
					first (which was the earle of Arrane) became a bitter and heauie enimie besides
					all reason against earle Morton, because that Morton refused to exchange the
					baronies of Poke and Maxwell Hewch with Arrane, which most instantlie required
					the same, in respect they adioined neere vnto other lands which Arrane had
					procured to himselfe. For although that Arrane would in place of those required
					lands haue deliuered others of no lesse <note place="marg" anchored="false">The earle of Arrane
						would exchange lands with the earle Morton.</note> value and honor (for he
					would haue giuen the baronie of Kinneile for the same) yet Morton had good cause
					and no lesse reason not to yeeld therevnto: as well for that Maxwell Hewch was
					his ancient inheritance, and the first land which his ancestors had, and whereof
					they tooke the name of lord Maxwell; as for that, that there were manie of the
					surname of the Maxwels, who dwelling vpon these lands, would not become subiect
					to the earle of Arrane, <note place="marg" anchored="false">The Maxwels would not be subiect to
						the earle of Arrane.</note> as they must haue béene if he had departed with
					those lands; amongst which Maxwels so refusing to become tenants to Arrane, were
					Iohn Maxwell lard of Newarke, and William Maxwell lard of Poke.</p>
				<p part="N">This thus handled, the king assembled a parlement in Maie, wherein were certeine
					lawes enacted, which giuing occasion to some of the nobilitie and clergie to
					misconceiue thereof, and to depart the realme, did after minister cause to the
					king (for the more discharge of his honour, the better explaining of the said
					lawes, and the manifesting of secret practises against him) to set downe this
					following declaration thereof to the view of the world. Wherin he shewed
					himselfe of a rare and good disposition, in that he would humble himselfe
					beneath the maiestie of his crowne, publikelie to render a reason to his
					neighbours and to his subiects of his dealings, towards such as were vnder his
					gouernment, sith he was not bound therevnto, being to dispose of those his
					subiects according to the lawes of his realme and the customes of those
					countries. But before I set downe that declaration, I thinke it not vnmeet to
					saie somewhat of such things as went before, and were the cause of setting
					foorth of the same declaration. There were some lawes in the same parlement

					religion, which to the king séemed to be growne ouer dangerous, in séeking a
					certeine equalitie of gouernment in the ecclesiasticall hierarchie. Vpon which
					law established, the earles of Angus and Mar, with diuers others of the
					temporaltie and the spiritualtie, as Andrew Meluine, and such as professed the
					purer and reformed religion (as it was termed) were inforced for the vse of
					their conscience and for other causes, to banish themselues from their countrie,
					and to flie into England there to vse the libertie of their religion, and to
					prouide for the safetie of their persons, who comming into this realme, made
					their abode and soiourned at Norwich. About which time also of their departure
					out of Scotland, there was a supposed treason discouered by Robert Hamilton vnto
					the king, intended to be practised against his maiestie, wherevpon some were
					summoned vpon suspicion, some were apprehended, and some were executed for the
					same cause. Of the first sort, the lord Blakater and George Dowglasse were
					summoned to the court vpon suspicion that they were consenting and conceling to
					and of the same treasons. For the second part touching the same, the lord of
					Donwhasell, the lord of Dunkreth, the lord of Baithkict, Robert Hamilton of
					Inchmachan, and Iames Sterling, were apprehended at the kings court: besides
					which Iohn Hoppingell of the Moores was taken at his owne house by the capteine
					of the kings gard, and the lord Keier with the lord Maius and other gentlemen
					were taken about Sterling; and lastlie the lord Donwhasell and the lord Maius

								<p part="N"><hi rend="smallcap">FOR </hi>as much as there is some euill
									affected men that goeth about so farre as in them lieth, to
									inuent lies and tales to slander and impaire the kings maiesties
									fame and honor, &amp; to raise reports as if his maiestie had
									declined to papistrie, &amp; that he had made manie acts to
									abolish the frée passage of the gospell, good order and
									discipline in the church: which brutes are mainteined by
									rebellious subiects, who would gladlie couer their seditious
									enterprises vnder pretense of religion (albeit there can be no
									good religion in such as raise rebellion to disquiet the state
									of their natiue souereigne, and periuredlie dooth stand against
									the oth, band, &amp; obligation of their faith, wherevnto they
									haue subscribed) therfore that his maiesties faithfull subiects
									be not abused with such slanderous reports, and his highnesse
									good affectionat friends in other countries maie vnderstand the
									verities of his vpright intention, his highnesse hath commanded
									this bréefe declaration of certeine of his maiesties acts of
									parlement holden in Maie one thousand fiue hundred foure score
									and foure, to be published and imprinted, to the effect that the
									indirect practises of such as slander his maiestie and his lawes
									maie be detected and discouered.</p>
								<p part="N">In the first act his maiestie ratifieth and approoueth the true
									profession of the gospell, sincere preaching of the word and
									administration of the sacraments, presentlie by the goodnesse of
									God established within this realme, and alloweth of the
									confession of the faith set downe by act of parlement the first
									yere of his maiesties reigne. Likewise his highnesse not onlie
									professeth the same in all sinceritie, but (praised be God) is
									come to that ripenesse of iudgement by reading and hearing the
									word of God, that his highnesse is able to conuince and
									ouerthrow by the doctrine of the prophets and apostles the most
									learned of the contrarie sect. So that (as Plato affirmeth that
									common wealth to be counted happie wherein a philosopher
									reigneth, or he that reigneth is a philosopher) we maie much
									more estéeme this countrie of Scotland to be fortunate, wherein
									our king is a diuine, and whose hart is replenished with the
									knowledge of the heauenlie philosophie: for the comfort not
									onlie of his good subiects and friends in other countries but of
									them that professeth the gospell euerie where, he being a king
									of great wisedome, and by his birth-right borne to great
									possession; but much more his <!--<fw place="bot-left">"VOL. V."</fw>--><!--<fw place="bot-center">"4 Y"</fw>--><!--<fw place="bot-right">"nesse,"</fw>-->

									highnesse, vertue, godlinesse and learning, and dailie increase
									of all heauenlie sciences, dooth promise and assure him of the
									mightie protection of God, and fauour of all them that feare his
									holie name.</p>
								<p part="N">In the second act his maiesties roiall authoritie ouer all
									estates both spirituall and temporall is confirmed: which act
									some of malice, and some of ignorance doth traduce, as if his
									maiestie pretended to be called the head of the church, a name
									which his maiestie acknowledgeth to be proper and peculiar to
									the sonne of God the sauiour of the world, who is the head, and
									bestoweth life spirituall vpon the members of his mysticall
									bodie, and he hauing receiued the holie spirit in all abundance,
									maketh euerie one of the faithfull partakers there. of,
									according to the measure of faith bestowed vpon them, of the
									which number of thefaitfull vnder the head Christ, his maiestie
									acknowledgeth himselfe to be a member baptised in his name,
									partaker of the misterie of the crosse and holie communion, and
									attending with the faithfull for the comming of the Lord and the
									finall resurrection of Gods elect. And notwithstanding his
									maiestie surelie vnderstandeth by the scriptures, that he is the
									chéefe and principall member appointed by the law of God, to sée
									God glorified, vice punished and vertue mainteined within his
									realme: and the souereigne iudgment of a godlie quietnesse &amp;
									order in the common wealth, to apperteine to his highnesse care
									and solicitude. Which power and authoritie of his highnesse,
									certeine ministers being called before his maiestie for their
									seditious and factious sermons in stirring vp the people to
									rebellion against their natiue king (by the instigation of
									sundrie vnquiet spirits) would in no wise acknowledge but
									disclaime his maiesties authoritie as an incompetent iudge: and
									especiallie one called master Andrew Meluin of a salt and fierie
									humor, vsurping the pulpit of Saundois, without anie lawfull
									calling, and priuie at that time to certeine conspiracies
									attempted against his maiestie and crowne, went about in a
									sermon vpon a sundaie, to inflame the harts of the people by
									odious comparisons of his maiesties progenitors and councell,
									albeit the dutie of a faithfull preacher of the gospell be
									rather to exhort the people to obedience of their natiue king,
									and not by popular sermons (which hath béene the euersion and
									decaie of great cities and common wealths, and hath greatlie in
									times past bred disquietnesse to the state thereby) to trouble
									and perturbe the countrie. The said master Andrew being called
									before his highnesse, presumptuouslie answered that he would not
									be iudged by the king and councell, because he had spoken the
									same in pulpit, which pulpit in effect he alleged to be exempted
									from the iudgement and correction of princes, as if that holie
									place sanctified to the word of God and to the breaking of the
									bread of life, might be anie colour to anie sedition in word or
									déed against the lawfull authoritie, without punishment. Alwaies
									his maiestie (being of himselfe a most gratious prince) was not
									willing to haue vsed anie rigor against the said master Andrew,
									if he had humblie submitted himselfe, acknowledged his offense,
									and craued pardon: who notwithstanding afraid of his owne
									giltinesse, being priuie to diuers conspirators before, fled out
									of the realme, whose naughtie &amp; presumptuous refusing of his
									highnesse iudgement, was the occasion of the making of this
									second act: that is, that none should decline from his highnesse
									authoritie, in respect that the common prouerbe beareth "Ex
									malis moribus bonæ leges natæ sunt," which is, that Of euill
									maners good lawes proceed. And in verie deed it wanteth not anie
									right intollerable arrogancie in anie subiect called before his
									prince, professing and authorising the same truth, to disclaime
									his authoritie, neither doo the prophets, apostles, or others
									(conducted by the spirit of God) minister the like example: for
									it is a great error to affirme (as manie doo) that princes and
									magistrats haue onlie power to take order in ciuill affaires,
									and that ecclesiasticall matters doo onelie belong to the
									ministerie.</p>
								<p part="N">By which meanes the pope of Rome hath exempted himselfe and his
									cleargie from all iudgment of princes, and he made himselfe to
									be iudge of iudges, and to be iudged of no man: whereas by the
									contrarie, not onelie by the example of the godlie gouernors,
									iudges, and kings of the old testament; but also by the new
									testament, and the whole historie of the primitiue church, in
									which the emperors being iudges ouer the bishops of Rome,
									deposed them from their seats, appointed iudges to decide and
									determine causes ecclesiasticall, and <!--<fw place="bot-right">"challenge"</fw>-->
									<pb n="715"/>
									<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"715"</fw>-->
									challenge innocent men, as Athanasius from the determination of
									the councell holden at Tirus, and by infinit good reasons which
									shall be set downe by the grace of God in an other seuerall
									worke, and shall be sufficientlie prooued and verified. But this
									appéereth at this present to be an vntimelie and vnprofitable
									question, which hath no ground vpon their part, but of the
									preposterous imitation of the pretended iurisdiction of the pope
									of Rome. For if there were anie question of this land of
									heresie, whereby the profound mysteries of the scriptures
									behoued to be searched foorth, his maiestie would vse the same
									remedie (as most expedient) which the most godlie emperors haue
									vsed: and his maiestie following their example would allow the
									councell of learned pastors, that by conference of scriptures
									the veritie might be opened, and heresie repressed.</p>
								<p part="N">But God be thanked, we haue no such controuersies in this land,
									neither hath anie heresie taken anie déepe root in the countrie;
									but that certeine of the ministerie, ioining themselues to
									rebels haue trauelled to disquiet the state with such questions,
									that the people might imbrace anie sinister opinion of his
									maiesties vpright procéedings, and factions might be nourished
									and interteined in the countrie: neither is it his maiesties
									meaning nor intention in anie sort, to take awaie the lawfull
									and ordinarie iudgement in the church, whereby discipline and
									good order might decaie; but rather to preserue, increase, and
									mainteine the same. And as there is in this realme, iustices,
									conestables, shiriffes, prouosts, bailiffes, and other iudges in
									temporall matters: so his maiestie alloweth that all things
									might be doone in order, and a godlie quietnes may be preserued
									in the whole estate; the synodall assemblies by the bishops, or
									commissioners, where the place was vsed to be conuenient, twise
									in the yeare to haue the ordinarie triall of matters belonging
									to the ministerie and their estate: alwaies reseruing to his
									highnesse, that if they, or anie of them doo amisse, neglect
									their dutie, disquiet the estate, or offend in anie such maner
									and sort, that they in no waies pretend anie immunitie,
									priuilege, and exemption, which onelie was inuented by the popes
									of Rome, to tread vnder foot the scepter of princes, and to
									establish an ecclesiastical tyrannie within this countrie, vnder
									pretense of new inuented presbyters, which neither should answer
									to the king nor bishop vnder his maiestie: but should haue such
									infinit iurisdiction, as neither the law of God nor man can
									tollerat; which is onelie his maiesties intention to represse,
									and not to take awaie godlie or due order in the church, as
									hereafter shall appeare.</p>
								<p part="N">The third act of his maiesties foresaid parlement dischargeth all
									iudgements ecclesiasticall, and all assemblies which are not
									allowed by his maiesties parlement. Which act speciallie
									concerneth the remouing and discharging of that forme, inuented
									in this land, called the presbyterie: wherein a number of
									ministers of certeine precinets and bounds, accounting
									themselues to be equall, without anie difference, and gathering
									vnto them certeine gentlemen and others of his maiesties
									subiects, vsurpe the whole ecclesisticall iurisdiction, &amp;
									altereth the laws at their owne pleasure, without the knowledge
									or approbation of the king, or of the estate: a forme of dooing
									without example of anie nation, subiect to a christian prince.
									The perill whereof did so increase, that in case it had not
									beene repressed in due season, &amp; forbidden by his maiesties
									laws, the same had troubled the whole countrie: and being tried
									by his highnesse to be the ouerthrow of his maiesties estate,
									the decaie of his crowne, and a readie introduction to
									Anabaptistrie, and popular confusion in all estates; his
									maiestie hath giuen commandement against the same. And that the
									reader may know the danger thereof by manie inconueniences,
									which thereby insueth in this land, I will onelie set downe one,
									whereby they may vnderstand what perill was in the rest.</p>
								<p part="N">The ambassador of France, returning home into his countrie,
									commanded the prouosts, bailiffes, and conestable of Edenburgh
									to make him a banket, that he might be receiued honorablie
									according to the amitie of ancient times betwéene two nations.
									This commandement was giuen on the saturdaie by his highnesse,
									and the banket appointed to be on the mondaie. A number of the
									foresaid pretended presbyterie vnderstanding thereof, assembled
									themselues on the sundaie in the morning, and presumptouslie
									determined &amp; agréed, that the ministers of Edenburgh should
									proclame a fasting vpon the same mondaie; where their <!--<fw place="bot-center">"4 Y 2"</fw>--><!--<fw place="bot-right">"seuerall"</fw>-->
									<pb n="716"/>
									<!--<fw place="top-left">"716"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->
									seuerall ministers one after another made thrée seuerall
									sermons, and inuectiues against the prouosts, bailiffes, and
									councell for the time, and the noble men in the countrie; who
									repared to the banket at his maiesties command. The foresaid
									presbyteric called and persuaded them, and scarselie by his
									maiesties authoritie could be withholden from excommunicating
									the magistrats and noble men, for obeieng onelie his highnesse
									lawfull command; which the law of all countries called <emph>Ius
										gentium</emph> requires towards ambassadors of forren
									countries. And not onelie in this, but innumerable other things,
									their commandement was proclamed directlie, vnder the paine of
									excommunication to the kings maiestie and his lawes.</p>
								<p part="N">Which forme of proceeding ingendered nothing but disquietnesse,
									sedition, and trouble: as may manifestlie appeare, in that the
									especiall authors of the inuenting, promoting, and assisting of
									the foresaid pretended presbyterie, hath ioined themselues with
									his maiesties rebels; and flieng foorth of the realme, in
									respect of their guiltinesse, hath discouered what malicious
									practises was deuised amongst them, if God had not in time
									prouided remedie. The other forme of iudgement, which his
									maiestie hath discharged, is the generall assemblie of the whole
									cleargie in the realme: vnder pretense whereof a number of
									ministers from sundrie presbyteries did assemble, with some
									gentlemen of the countrie; whereof, some for that time
									(malcontents of the state) sought that colour as fauorers of the
									ministerie, by the which they haue practised manie enterprises
									in the realme; where there was no certeine law in
									ecclesiasticall affaires, but all depended vpon the said
									generall conuention, where the laws of the church were alterable
									after the number of voices, which for the most part succéeded
									vnto the most vnlearned of the multitude.</p>
								<p part="N">This generall assemblie amongst other things, did appoint and
									agrée with his maiesties regents in his minoritie, that the
									*estate of bishops should be mainteined and authorised, as is
										<note place="marg" anchored="false">*Which is one of the estates of
										parlement.</note> registred in the bookes of councell, and
									subscribed by the commissioners for the time. Which order was
									obserued manie yeares, and bishops by their consents appointed
									to their diocesse, vntill within this late time, in assemblies
									holden at Dundée, and Glascow, respecting the foresaid ministers
									and assemblies, tooke vpon them contrarie to their owne
									handwriting, to discharge the estate, and to declare the same to
									be vnlawfull in their pretended manner. And there commanded the
									bishops of the countrie, to demit and leaue their offices and
									iurisdictions, and that in no wise they should passe to the
									kings councell or pailement, without commission obteined from
									their assemblie: that they should confirme nothing in parlement
									and councell, but according to their acts and iniunctions. And
									further, they directed their commissioners to the kings
									maiestie, commanding him and the councell vnder paine of the
									censures of the church (whereby they vnderstood excommunication)
									to appoint no bishop in time to come, because they had concluded
									that estate to be vnlawfull. And notwithstanding, that which
									they would haue deiected in the bishops, they purposed to erect
									in themselues, desiring that such commissioners as they should
									send to parlement and councell, might be authorised in place of
									the estate: wherby it should haue come to passe, that whereas
									now his maiestie may select the most godlie, learned, wise, and
									experimented of the ministerie, to be on his maiesties estate,
									his highnesse should haue beene by that meanes compelled to
									accept such as the multitude, by an od consent of the most
									vnlearned, should haue appointed, which could not tend but to
									the ouerthrow of the realme.</p>
								<p part="N">After they had discharged bishops, they agréed to haue
									superintendents, commissioners, and visitors: but in the end
									they decerned that there should be no difference amongst the
									ministers, and imagined that new forme of presbyterie, whereof
									we haue spoken before. Neither was there anie other apparance
									that they should haue staied from such dailie alterations in the
									common-wealth, which could not but continuallie be disquieted,
									where the law of conscience, which they mainteined by the sword
									of cursing, was subiect to such mutations, at the arbitrement of
									a number, whereof the most part had not greatlie tasted of
									learning. At once the foresaid assemblie was accustomed, not
									onelie to prescribe the law to the king and estate, but also did
									at certeine times appoint generall fastings through out the
									realme; especiallie, when some factioner in the countrie was to
									moue anie great enterprise. For at the fast, all <!--<fw place="bot-right">"the"</fw>-->
									<pb n="717"/>
									<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"717"</fw>-->
									the ministers were commanded by the assemblie to sing one song,
									and to crie out vpon the abuses (as they termed it) of the court
									and estate for the time: whereby is most cereine great
									alterations to haue insued in this land; while at the good
									pleasure of God, and his blessing towards his maiestie, the
									pretense of the last fast was discouered, and his highnesse
									deliuered from such attempts, whereby his maiestie hath béene
									iustlie moued to discharge such conuentions, which might import
									so preiudiciallie to his estate.</p>
								<p part="N">But especiallie his maiestie had no small occasion, whereas the
									same assemblie being met at Edenburgh, did authorise and auow
									the fact perpetrate at Ruthwen, in the taking of his highnesse
									most noble person. The which déed notwithstanding, with the
									aduise of his estates in parlement accounted to be treason, the
									said assemblie esteeming their iudgement to be the souereigne
									iudgement of the realme, hath not onlie approoued the same, but
									also ordeined all them to be excommunicate that would not
									subscribe and allow the same. So the acts of this assemblie, and
									the lawes of the estate directed, weied in ciuill matter, with
									the which the assemblie should not haue medled, it behooued his
									highnesse either to discharge himselfe of the crowne, or the
									ministerie of the forme of the assemblie, which in déed of it
									selfe, without the kings maiesties licence &amp; approbation,
									could not be lawfull, like as generall councels at no time could
									assemble, without the commandement of the emperor for the time.
									And our king hath no lesse power within his owne realme than
									anie of them had in the empire. Yea the bishop of S. Andrewes
									had not in time of poperie power to conuent the bishops and
									clergie out of their owne diocesse, without licence giuen before
									by his highnes most noble progenitors of good memorie, and the
									causes thereof intimate and allowed.</p>
								<p part="N">Notwithstanding that his maiesties intention and meaning maie
									fullie be vnderstood, it is his highnesse will, that the bishop
									or commissioners of anie diocesse or prouince, or part thereof,
									shall at their visitation appoint in euerie parish, according to
									the greatnesse thereof, some honest, vertuous, and discréet men,
									to aid and assist the minister, and to haue the ouersight and
									censure of the maners and behauior of the people of that parish.
									And if there be anie notable offense, worthie of punishment,
									that the bishop and commissioners be aduertised thereof, who
									shall haue an officer of armes to be assistant for the
									punishment of vice and executions to follow therevpon: that they
									who contemne the godlie and lawfull order of the church, maie
									find by experience his maiesties displeasure, and be punished
									according to their deseruings. And further, his maiestie vpon
									necessarie occasions which shall fall foorth, by diuers maners
									of waies amongst the clergie, vpon humble supplication made to
									his highnesse, will not refuse to grant them licence to assist
									the bishops, commissioners, and some of the most vertuous,
									learned and godlie of their diocesse, where such ecclesiasticall
									matters, as apperteine to the vniformitie of doctrine and
									conuersation of a godlie order in the church, maie be intreated
									and concluded in his maiesties owne presence, or some of his
									honorable councell, who shall assist for the time: where if
									necessitie so require, a publike fast throughout the whole
									realme maie be commanded, and by his maiesties authoritie
									proclamed, to auoid the imminent displeasure and danger of the
									wrath of the Lords iudgements, which is the right end of publike
									humilitie, and not vnder pretense thereof to couer such
									enterprises, as haue heretofore disquieted and troubled the
									peace of this common wealth.</p>
								<p part="N">The twentith act ratifieth and approoueth, and establisheth the
									estate of the bishops within the realme, to haue the ouersight
									and iurisdiction, euerie one in their owne diocesse: which forme
									of gouernement, and rule in ecclesiasticall affaires, hath not
									onlie continued in the church from the daies of the apostles, by
									continuall succession of time, and manie martyrs in that calling
									shed their bloud for the truth: but also sith this realme
									imbraced and receiued the christian religion, the same estate
									hath béene mainteined, to the welfare of the church, and
									quietnes of the realme without anie interruption, vntill within
									these few yeares, some curious and busie men haue practised to
									induce into the ministerie an equalitie in all things, as well
									concerning the preaching of the word, administration of the
									sacraments, as likewise in discipline, order, and policie. The
									which confusion his maiestie finding by most dangerous <!--<fw place="bot-right">"experience,"</fw>-->
									<pb n="718"/>
									<!--<fw place="top-left">"718"</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>-->
									experience, to haue béene the mother and nurse of great
									factions, seditions, and troubles within this realme, hath with
									aduise of his highnes estates, aduisedlie concluded, the said
									pretended partie in discipline, orders and policie in the
									church, to be no longer to be tolerated in his countrie, but the
									solicitude &amp; care of all churches in one diocesse to
									apperteine to the bishop and commissioners therof, who shall be
									answerable to God, and his maiestie, and estates, for the right
									administration and discharge of the office of particular
									ministers, within the bounds of his iurisdiction. For as it
									becommeth his maiestie, as Eusebius writeth of Constantinus the
									great, to be a bishop of bishops, and vniuersall bishop within
									his realme, in so far as his maiestie should appoint euerie one
									to discharge his duetie: which his highnesse cannot, his
									countrie being large and great, take him to euerie minister that
									shall offend and transgresse against dutie, or quarell with the
									whole number of the ministerie: but it behooueth his maiestie to
									haue bishops &amp; ouerseers vnder him which maie be answerable
									for such bounds, as the law and order of the countrie hath
									limited and appointed to euerie one of them. And that they
									hauing accesse to his maiesties parlement and councell, maie
									intercede for the rest of the brethren of the ministerie,
									propone their gréefe vnto his highnesse and estates, and receiue
									his maiesties fauorable answere therein. The which forme dooth
									preserue a godlie quietnesse, vnitie, concord and peace in the
									estate, and one vniforme order in the church. As contrariwise,
									the pretended equalitie diuideth the same, and vnder the
									pretense of equalitie maketh the same of the most craftie and
									subtile dealers to be aduanced and inriched: and in pretending
									of partie, to séeke nothing but their owne ambition and
									aduancement aboue the rest of the simple sort.</p>
								<p part="N">And notwithstanding that his maiestie hath re-established the
									said estate, it is not his highnesse will and intent, that the
									foresaid bishop shall haue such full power as to doo within his
									diocesse what he pleaseth. For his maiestie cannot allow of anie
									popular confusion, wheréin (as the prouerbe saith) "Nulla
									tyrannis æquiparanda est tyrannidi multitudinis," that is: No
									tyrannie can be compared to the tyrannie of a multitude, hauing
									commandement and power in his hands: so on the other part his
									maiesties will is, that the bishops authoritie in anie graue
									matter, be limited to the councell of thirtéene of the most
									ancien, wise, and godlie persons of his diocesse, selected out
									of the whole synodall assemblie of the prouince: by whose
									aduise, or at the least the most part thereof, the weightie
									affaires of the church maie be gouerned to the glorie of God,
									and quietnes of the realme. Further it is his highnesse will and
									commandement, that their bishops and commissioners twise in the
									yeare, to wit, ten daies after Easter, and the sixt of
									September, hold their synodall assemblies in euerie diocesse,
									for the kéeping of good orders therein: and if anie be
									stubborne, or contemne within their bounds the good order of the
									church, that it maie be declared vnto his maiestie, and punished
									to the example of others, according to their deseruings. Neither
									is it his maiesties meaning or intent, that such bishops or
									commissioners as shall be appointed, shall receiue their onelie
									and full commission of his maiestie without admission ordinarie,
									by such as are appointed to that effect in the church: but
									hauing his highnesse nomination, presentation, and commendation
									as lawfull and onlie patrone, they to be tried and examined,
									that their qualities are such as they are able to discharge
									their cure and office. And if it shall happen anie of the said
									bishops or commissioners, to be negligent in their office, or to
									be slanderous or offensiue in their behauior, life, and maners,
									in time to come, it is not his highnesse will, that they shall
									be exempted from correction, notwithstanding anie priuilege of
									his highnes estate, councell or parlement: but their labors,
									trauels, diligence and behauiors, to be tried in the generall
									assemblie, not consisting of a confused multitude, as it was
									before; but of such worshipfull persons as is heretofore
									prescribed in his highnesse presence, or his deputies to that
									effect.</p>
								<p part="N">Lastlie his maiestie giueth commission to the said bishops or
									commissioners at their visitations, to consider in what part of
									the countrie, the enterprise, or interpretation of the
									scripture, by conference of a certeine number of the ministerie
									within those bounds, maie be most commodiouslie once in euerie
									fiftéene daies. For as his maiestie inhibits all vnlawfull <!--<fw place="bot-right">"ings,"</fw>-->
									<pb n="719"/>
									<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE HISTORIE OF SCOTLAND."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"719"</fw>-->
									méetings, that maie ingender trouble and contention in the
									countrie: so his maiestie is well affected to sée the ministerie
									increase in knowledge and vnderstanding, and by all meanes to
									fortifie and aduance the same. Wherein his highnesse
									commandement is, that a graue, wise, and sage man shall be
									appointed president, who maie haue the ouersight of these
									bounds, and be answerable therefore to the bishop, his councell
									and synod; and he to be respected reasonablie for his paines, at
									the modification of stipends: that all things maie be orderlie
									doone in the church, peace &amp; quietnesse maintened in the
									realme, and we deliuered from apparant plagues, and the

				<p part="N">These things was the king faine to publish, to staie the euill report of such as
					went about to touch him for the breach of the christian order in religion, which
					being nothing but that which séemeth answerable to naturall sense &amp;
					princelie maiestie, should neither by malice haue mooued, nor for colour of
					religion procured anie beyond the warrant of the word of God, or the duetie of
					naturall allegiance to resist the kinglie ordinance, or to lift vp their sword

					it belongeth to instruct vs in our dutie to God, to our prince, &amp; to our
					neighbours, we will turne againe to the other following occurrents of Scotland.
					And yet before we speake anie thing of those matters, sith I haue in this place
					as well as in manie other spoken of parlements &amp; acts of parlement, I thinke
					it not amisse to set downe somewhat collected out of authors touching their
					manner and order of parlement, and that the rather bicause the same consisteth
					of thrée estates, and the princes confirmation as our parlement dooth, from
					whome it séemeth <note place="marg" anchored="false">The parlement of Scotland consisteth of
						thrée estats.</note> to me that they haue fet their light. Touching which,
					Lesleus in his Scotish historie lib. 1. pag. 75, vnder the title of <emph>Leges
						Scotorum,</emph> writeth in this sort. "Qui verò seculi negotijs sese
					implicantes in ecclesiasticorum album non referuntur, legibus, quas reges
					descripserunt, aut regum voce confirmatas, tres regni ordines sanxerūt,
					continentur, has partim Latino, partim Scotico sermone confirmatas, regni
					municipales leges vocamus: libro qui leges Latinè scriptas continet, titulus
					(regiam maiestatem) præfigitur, quòd ab illis vocibus libri exordium ducatu;.
					Reliquis legum libris, comitiorū (quæ populari sermone parliamenta dicimus) acta
					inseribuntur. Quanquam hîc aduertendum, nos ita lege municipali teneri, vt si
					causa multis controuersijs implicata (quod sæpe sit) incidat quæ legibus

					of the three estates, &amp; the princes confirming voice (in the beginning
					whereof the king goeth to the place where that assemblie is made, to kéepe such

					as séemeth <note place="marg" anchored="false">Parlements nicknamed.</note> best liking to
					themselues, and is most answerable to the nature &amp; order of that parlement,
					as we also doo héere in England, whereof I could produce manie examples of both
					nations, which at this time I will forbeare, and onelie set downe one proofe (as
					well of England as Scotland) to confirme the same, least in passing it ouer
					without some example thereof, I might make a vaine shew of knowledge consisting
					in naked words, without anie sound matter. Wherefore I saie, that as in England
					in the yeare of our redemption one thousand <note place="marg" anchored="false">The made
						parlement.</note> two hundred fiftie and eight, being the two and fortith
					yeare of the reigne of king Henrie the third, the parlement held at Oxford by
					the lords against the king, was called <emph>Parliamentum insanum,</emph>
					bicause manie things were there intreted which turned to the death of diuerse
					noble men. So the Scots in like maner bynamed a parlement, in the yeare of
					Christ 1556, (being the foureteenth yeare of Marie the now imprisoned queene of
					Scotland) and called the same a running parlement, bicause there were manie
					intermissions and remoouings during the <note place="marg" anchored="false">The running
						parlement.</note> continuance thereof, as appeareth by Lesleus in these
					words. "Aestate sequenti habita sunt Edinburgi trium ordinum comitia, in quibus
					domini Brunstonius, Grangius, Balnauius, &amp; alij nonnulli, quorum bona à
					gubernatore publicata fuerunt, singulari regis Franciæ <note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Lesleus.</emph></note> commendatione dignati, famæ atque bonis
					restituti sunt. Hæc verò comitia quòd intermissa, potiùs quàm omissa, quasi
					continuarentur, nomen à vulgo acceperunt, vt currentia dicerentur." Thus much
					being said about their parlements, let vs againe fall with our pen into the
					other matters of Scotland, which followed the former parlement assembled in
					Maie, and mooued the king to make that declaration thereof which I haue before
					set downe.</p>
				<p part="N">About the time that the earle Gowrike or Gowrie was as before is remembred
					beheaded, the king did roiallie set forward his iourneie, and possessed the
					towne of Sterling, in which the said earle was executed, hauing a sister married
					to Lesle earle of Rothos, and a daughter married to Steward earle of Atholl.
					After the death of the said earle Gowricke lord treasuror of Scotland, the king
					bestowed that office vpon Grahame earle of Montrosse, who had married the lord
					Dromands sister, which name of Grame is supposed to be deduced from Grahame, who
					in the yeare of Christ foure hundred twentie and two, resisted the Romans,
					inuading the Picts and Scots, for when Victorinus the Romane legat, had againe
						<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Lesleus li.</emph> 4. <emph>pag.</emph> 133.</note>
					commanded a trench or fense to be made from the castell of Abincorne to Cluide,
					the same was vtterlie ouerthrowne and cast abroad by the noble Capteine Grame,
					of whome as is supposed the familie of the Grames liuing at this daie had their
					originall, the same place to this daie being called the trench of Grame or
					Grames trench.</p>
				<p part="N">The tenth of September (after that he was sent for by the queene of England vpon
					certeine articles laid against him) did George Talbot erle of Shrewsburie (a
					graue and honourable person, who had Marie the imprisoned queene of Scots in his
					custodie at Sheffeld castell) repaire to London according to his dutie, to
					answer those things which should be obiected against him, who comming to London
					verie honorablie attended on with his owne retinue, amounting to the number of
					two hundred horsse, and with some few others of the queenes men, which were sent
					to bring him vp, repaired to his house at Coleherbert in London from whense in
					Nouember going to the court to answer the things to be obiected vnto him, about
					the custodie and vsage of the same queene of Scots, which had manie yeers beene
					vnder his charge, he answered the matter verie honourablie, and to his good
					discharge, being then dismissed of the keeping of the same queene of Scots.
					During whose being here at London the queene of Scots was appointed to the

					doctor Nicholas Wotton, of whome I haue spoken more in the historie of England.
					These hauing this queene thus committed vnto them, did (as persons carfull of so
					weightie a charge) remooue hir to a place of good strength, and conueied hir to

					remaining long in their custodie) bicause they were remooued and others put in

					honourable familie, with whome and vnder whose charge she still remaineth at
					this present in the said castle of Tutburie.</p>
				<p part="N">But to leaue that matter, we saie that about the tenth daie of Ianuarie following
					this discharge of the earle of Shrewsburie, sir Lewis Balentine knight, iustice,
					clerke, and maister of the ceremonies of the kings house, which office as I haue
					beene crediblie informed by a Scot (but how trulie I leaue to others) his
					father, his grandfather, and great grandfather before him, did inioie, and to
					whome most of the nobilitie of Scotland, either by affinitie, consanguinitie, or
					aliance, were linked in blood, a goodlie yoong gentleman about the age of
					thirtie yeares, was sent ambassador into England for the redeliuerie and
					accusation of the erle of Angus and Marre, and the other nobles which were fled
					out of Scotland into England for a supposed treason wrought by them against
					their king, whose redeliuerie was required of the queene of England, to the end
					the king might execute the law vpon them. In which his ambassage he behaued
					himselfe before the councell of England so grauelie and learnedlie, that the
					said earles were sent for from Norwich (where they soiorned before his comming)
					to Westminster, there to answere to such things as should be laid to their
					charge by the said sir Lewis Balentine. Wherevpon after that the said ambassador
					had remained in England at London (honorablie interteined and feasted of the
					nobilitie and others) by the space of seuenteene weeks, he was dispatched into
					his countrie with answer, that hir maiestie would shortlie send an ambassador
					into Scotland which should fullie satisfie the king. Wherevpon the said sir
					Lewis Balentine departed from London on the tenth daie of Maie following, in the
					yeare of our redemption one thousand fiue hundred eightie and fiue, and so
					returned <note place="marg" anchored="false"><date instant="false">1585.</date></note> into Scotland; much about
					which time, as is before a little touched, was Marie queene of Scots, remaining
					in the custodie of sir Ralfe Sadler in the castell of Tutburie, committed to the
					keeping of sir Aimese Paulet.</p>
				<p part="N">After this the queene of England the nineteenth daie of the said moneth of Maie
					dispatched in ambassage into Scotland, Edward Wootton esquier, a gentleman of
					good descent, and one whose ancestors had honorablie &amp; faithfullie serued
					manie princes of England, as well in the place of priuie councellors, as also in
					manie ambassages into forren nations: which ambassador being of yeares not much
					more than the said sir Lewis Balentine, had trauelled the most part of Europe,
					and had before time beene ambassador for the queene of England into Portingall.
					This gentleman so sent from the queene of England to the king of Scots, attended
					on by other English gentlemen, departed as is before said from London towards
					Scotland the nineteenth of Maie, who remaining at Berwike about three dais, did
					there receiue his conduct from the king of Scots to passe into his kingdome;
					which once obteined, he presentlie entred that land on Whitsun eeue, being the
					nine and twentith daie of the said moneth of Maie, and so came that daie to
					Edenburgh, being first at his entrance into the Scotish borders receiued by the
					lord Hume and his retinue, who conueied them to Seton house, where they were
					interteined by the lord Seton: after which when the ambassador was departed
					about halfe a mile from the said lord Setons house, he was met with sir Robert
					Meluin knight, maister William Keth one of the kings chamber, and others, which
					conueied him that night to Edenburgh. The next morrow (after that the English
					ambassador was come to the citie of Edenburgh) beig Whitsundaie, the ambassador
					was after dinner brought to the kings presence, where he had full audience for
					the deliuerie of his ambassage, consisting vpon the confirming of the old and
					concluding of a new league of amitie betweene the two nations of England and
					Scotland; which the king accepting in honorable part, did for that time dismisse
					the ambassador, vntill the minds &amp; consents of the nobilitie might be
					vnderstood and had. With which answer the ambassador then satisfied, tooke leaue
					of the king for that present, and remained still at Edenburgh some fortnight,
					interteined with sports of delights answerable to the course of the yeere, and

					whense the ambassador attending on the king was conueied to Dumfermling, where
					the king remained some time to repose himselfe, progressing from thense to
					Falkland, and so to saint Andrews, hauing the ambassador alwaies with him. When
					the king was come to saint Andrews, the noblemen and states of the realme
					repaired thither to hold a parlement, according to the former appointment.</p>
				<p part="N">But whilest these things did thus passe at saint Andrews, the time drew on, when
					the borderers of both the nations of England and Scotland should assemble
					according to the custome of the true daies, there to determine for recompense of
					all such iniuries as each people had offered to other, in conueieng of cattel or
					other booties from their borders; for which cause there did about the sixteenth
					daie of Iulie assemble the people of both the borders, and the wardens of the
					same; at what time the lord of Fernhurst warden of the Scotish borders, and sir
					Francis Russell knight lord Russell, and sir Iohn Foster knight warden of the
					middle marches came with their companie to the borders of Scotland, not far from
					Berwike, and so entred into speech with the Scots of such causes for which the
					repaired thither. After when the wardens were set vpon the bench to heare and
					determine the same, there did suddenlie arise among the people a contention,
					whereby followed at the first some small fraie, which being perceiued by sir
					Francis Russell, he arose from the bench and called for his horsse, who meaning
					to appease the matter, went among the prease. At what time a certeine number of
					shot comming on him, he was suddenlie, but most vniustlie, slaine with a peece
					amongst the rest discharged against him by a Scot borne about that place
					(suspected by the most to be the brother of the lord of Fernhurst) contrarie to
					the nature of such assemblies, where each part shuld labor for quiet, sith
					publike faith at such times are giuen, that euerie one shall returne home
					without anie damage or iniurie offered by anie side. The losse of which sir

				<p part="N">In the yeare of Christ one thousand fiue hundred and three score, Francis the

					the queene of England) were sent vnto the queene of Scots to conclude with hir,
					that the agreements and conditions of peace, which were established a little

									Amongst all the benefeits that God dooth bestow vpoun his elect

									the papistis, in a league quhich they terme holie, albeit most
									vnholie in varie truth, for the subuersioun of the trew

									of the smallest merchantis that trauill, as it dooth dilat the

								<p part="N">"This leagues whome of I speake, are composed of Frenchmen, and
									Hispaingnols, assisted with the king of Spaines and the papes

									they leaue armes: the performance quhereof we aught to resist

				<p part="N">Vpon this speech, the lords being of diuerse opinions, some willing to imbrace
					the league with England, and some desirous to leaue it, and to ioine in amitie
					with France according to the most ancientest leagues, which haue beene
					established betweene them and the Scots (by most of their former kings, whereof
					the first was Achaius, who entering league with Charles the great, had a token
					of confirmation thereof, which was the floure de lices added to the armes of
					Scotland) there was nothing doone in that conuention. After which, the banished
					lords of Scotland remaining in England, entered their countrie: the manner and
					time of the entrance of which nobilitie was in this sort.</p>
				<p part="N">Towards the latter end of September, the earls of Angus and Mar, with such others
					of their faction as were in England, did (after that they had long before this,
					sent thither the maister of Glames out of England to prepare their waie, which
					he did verie effectuallie) returne into Scotland; at whose comming into that
					their natiue countrie, there met with them about the borders, manie others of
					the nobilitie to ioine in one action, for the redresse of such gouernment as was
					vsed by persons about the king, suspected to nuzzell him in the Romane religion.
					After this their first meeting, they did by appointment disperse themselues,
					euerie one to the place of his most strength, and where he could make most
					friends and folowers, appointing a daie to meete againe at Fawkirke, a meete
					place fensed by nature for the assemblie of an armie. Wherevpon, some departed
					to Lowthian, some to Domefreis and others to other places. But in short time
					following they reassembled in October at Fawkirke with such power as they could
					make, which amounted to the number of ten or eleuen thousand persons. The report
					whereof was brought vnto the king, then remaining at a noble mans house (not far
					from Sterling, whereas a contract of mariage was solemnized. Vpon which, the
					king supposing it to stand most for his suretie (iudging these noblemen so
					assembled to be his enimies) conueied himselfe, and such nobilitie as were with
					him to Sterling, raising power (such as the present state of the time would
					permit) intending with them to haue subdued the earle of Angus and his companie:
					For which cause also, the earle of Arrane came from his house to Sterling, and
					the maister of Greie with commission rode to saint Iohns towne to assemble the
					kings subiects.</p>
				<p part="N">After that the earle of Arrane was come to Sterling to the king, the earles of
					Angus, Mar, Bothwell, Atholl, Marshall, the lords Hamilton, Hume, Heres,
					Cambuskeneth, Dribourgh, Paislaie, &amp; Coldingham; the lairds of Sefford,
					Drumlarige, Codentnewes, Wedderburne, with other earles, barons, gentlemen &amp;
					commons, with their friends &amp; complices, marching all night from Fawkirke,
					did in the next morning come to saint Ninians chappell within a mile of
					Sterling, and presented themselues before the towne of Sterling, before
					suspicion was had of their approch so neere. At what time, being the first of
					Nouember, they pitched their tents, placed there as it had beene a new towne, to
					the great terror of their enimies within Sterling: deliuering for the cause of
					their comming this proclamation following.</p>

								<p part="N">"<hi rend="smallcap">WHEREAS </hi>the kings maiestie our

									plainelie vnderstood to haue beene abused, and his roiall
									qualities giuen to him by the almightie God (which caused his
									fame far aboue the capacitie of his yeares to be magnified, and
									worthilie praised, to the great comfort of all his subiects)
									hath beene these yeares past obscured by the craft &amp;
									subtiltie of some lewd and wicked persons of no desert or
									woorthinesse, and for the most part of base linage, not borne to
									one foot breadth of land, yet of maruelous aspiring wrongs and
									cruell inclination; who vnder colour of friendship and bloud
									creeping in about his maiestie, and seeking onelie their owne
									particuliar profit and promotion: shaking off (as it were) not
									onelie all christian and charitable nature: but euen the
									generall points and offices of humanitie vsed amongst most
									barbarous people, without feare of God or man, as subtill foxes
									and bloudie woolues, by wresting of lawes and other deceitfull
									practises hath so wasted, torne in peeces, and deuoured the
									whole bodie of this afflicted commonwealth, that of the whole
									ancient forme of iustice and policie receiued of our ancestors,
									remaineth nothing, neither in spirituall or temporall estate;
									but the naked shadow &amp; counterfeited maske thereof to our
									souereignes high dishonor, our opprobrie (who are a part of his
									nobilitie) and heauie griefe of all good men throughout the
									realme. It is euidentlie knowne what iustice and quietnesse was
									in the realme, what heartie loue betwixt his maiestie and his
									subiects, what beautifull countenance the church of God had,
									what dailie hope of increase, what expectation was of his
									highnesse in forren nations, before the arriuall of Obigneie,
									afterwards calied the duke of Leneux; and the entring in credit
									of Iames Steward, and coronell Steward with their vnhappie
									companies. But what hath succeeded since no true Scotish heart
									can remember without extreame dolor: for there is no part or
									corner within the land at this time peaceable or quiet, but all
									replenished with particular enimities, and cruell reuenges
									without punishment.</p>
								<p part="N">"It is also well knowne, that whereas the wisest of his maiesties
									most noble progenitors labored by clemencie, not by crueltie to
									possesse the hearts of their subiects, &amp; to keepe the
									strengths of their relms in their owne hands (thereby meaning
									the better to preserue themselues against such inconueniences,
									as manie princes of that land misgouerned, and lead by peruerse
									counsell haue beene subiect vnto) that the foresaid abusors had
									depriued his maiestie both of the one and the other so far as in
									them laie. For the cheefe strength of the realme are in Arrane
									his hands, who bragging of his pedegree by descent from duke
									Mordacke (one that was beheaded for his treason against his
									souereigne) was not ashamed to saie (meaning of himselfe) Here
									stands the person of king Iames the seuenth. And to the end that
									the hearts of the people might be alienated from his highnesse,
									and so (as appeareth) his maiestie made vnable to punish them,
									if at anie time hereafter he should perceiue their false and
									treasonable dooings, what can be added more than these said
									seditious hath alreadie doone in that behalfe, seeing vnder his
									maiesties name and authoritie, such parcialitie is vsed in all

									dissimulation throughout the whole land, that were it not of his

									estate in maruellous danger, whereas now (blessed be God) all
									his true subiects are certeinelie persuaded, that if the said
									lewd persons could be separated from his maiestie, he would
									returne againe to exercise his former clemencie and towardnesse
									in euerie respect, which hath beene these yeares past

									destruction of certeine seuerall persons, but euen (as it
									appeareth) haue conspired against the whole bodie of the realme,
									in so much as there is no estate of the land free from their
									persecutions.</p>
								<p part="N">"The worthiest and most ancient of the barons and nobilitie
									(namelie such as haue giuen best proofe of their forwardnesse in
									true religion, and fidelitie to their souereigne) are by
									parcialitie, and wresting of lawes, without mercie either
									executed, coosoned, imprisoned, banished, or at the least
									debarred his maiesties presence, against the ministerie,
									schooles, and clergie, acts and proclamations published,
									inhibiting their presbyteries, assemblies, and other exercises,
									priuileges, and immunities ratified by parlements, proceedings,
									or at the least by laudable custome permitted euer since the
									first reformation of religion within this land; and without the
									which the puritie of doctrine, and right forme of the
									ecclesiasticall discipline cannot long continue: as being the
									onelie meanes to trie and examine the liues, maners, and
									knowledge of euerie person, and to reforme the same if need
									require. With this the most learned, and of most vnspotted liues
									of that number, are either compelled for safetie of their liues
									and consciences to abandon their countrie, or else inhibited to
									preach, or depriued of their stipends. Iesuits, seminarie
									priests, and such as be knowne practisers in diuers nations for
									the execution of the bloudie councell of Trent are interteined,
									and in great estimation; yea some indurated papists in session,
									to occupie the places from the which the most godlie and
									faithfull senators haue beene by them deiected. An euident
									presage of the ouerthrow of true religion. And concerning the
									estate of burowes, by intrusion of such magistrates to rule
									aboue them, as neither are comburgesses, nor apt to discharge
									themselues of such offices, but men elected to applause and to
									consent to the appetire of the reditious aforesaid, their
									priuileges and ancient liberties are so preiudiced, that without
									timelie remedie that estate (sometime a great ornament of the
									land) must needs suddenlie decaie. So as these three pillers
									(whereby the king and common wealth should be preserued, and
									vpholden) being wasted and vndermined in maner aboue written,
									what can be expected but vniuersall ruine and ouerthrow of the
									whole bodie of the estate; except God of his mercie preuent the
									same. Besides all these, the foresaid abusors not resting
									content with the enormities aboue expressed, haue practised, and
									dailie doo practise to turne the happie amitie and loue, which
									now a good space hath stood betweene the inhabitants of the
									whole Ile in open hostilitie and hatred, without respect of
									neighborhood or kindred, standing betweene the two princes, or
									regard had to the benefits that hir maiestie of England hath
									bestowed vpon the king our souereigne, and his whole countrie,
									first by planting of true religion within this realme, and next
									by preseruing his maiestie, when as in his minoritie he could
									not take in hand or enterprise for himselfe.</p>
								<p part="N">"To this effect they openlie delt with such persons, as by all
									meanes sought hir maiesties destruction, as by the confession of
									sundrie hir maiesties rebels latelie executed in England is made
									manifest. But how soone they perceiued open danger to arise, by
									open dealing with hir enimies, then fraudfullie to illude hir
									maiestie, they haue pretended these months past, in great
									freendship and kindnesse, promising largelie in that behalfe,
									and offering to capitulate a band offensiue and defensiue to
									stand perpetuallie. But in the end, notwithstanding all these
									liberall promises, the effects by experience declare nothing to
									haue beene in their minds but falshood &amp; crueltie, as by the
									late murder of the lord Russell is manifest to the whole world,
									who being a yoong nobleman, for his birth and qualities verie
									honorable and vertuous, and of great expectation, &amp; for his
									earnest zeale to religion, and good affection to the king and
									souereigne, and to all Scotishmen in generall, one that merited
									great praise, loue and commendation: yet he was murdered in most
									odious and treasonable maner, euen when as greatest kindnesse
									and freendship was pretended; which cannot but produce
									maruellous suspicion and slander, aswell against the king our
									souereigne, as against the whole countrie, to his maiesties
									great dishonor, and discredit of his innocent subiects, if
									condigne iustice be not ministred vpon the authors and the
									executors of the horrible crime aforesaid.</p>
								<p part="N">"Last, which is most of all, and necessarilie craueth present

									abusors couer all these enormities with his maiesties name and
									authoritie, thereby thinking to excuse themselues, and to laie
									the burden on him. And therefore, as it cannot be but verie
									slanderous and dangerous to his maiestie, if such licentious
									persons (who hath alreadie made shipwracke of all honestie) be
									suffered to remaine in his companie, so is it shamefull to be
									reported in other nations, that such a few number of beggerlie
									fellowes replenished with all vice, should extinguish the
									beautie of the nobilitie, haue empire ouer the whole countrie,
									&amp; keepe his maiestie thrall to authorise by his roiall power
									their abhominable and execrable facts. For the causes aforesaid
									and manie others that might be iustlie alleged, we of his
									maiesties nobilitie here present, in the feare of God and our
									souereignes obedience, being through Gods free mercie called to
									be professors of the blessed euangell, and borne councellors to
									his highnesse our souereigne, bound in duetie not onelie to
									hazzard, render and renounce our liues, lands, and goods (if
									need be) for the same euangell and true religion, but also in
									conscience charged to be carefull of his maiesties welfare,
									honor, and reputation, and to procure to our abilitie, peace and
									quietnesse to him and his realme, hauing our lands and heritages
									for that effect, holden of his maiesties most noble progenitors
									of woorthie memorie.</p>
								<p part="N">"In consideration of which great enormities and tyrannies, hauing
									connected our selues togither for redresse and reformation of
									the same, seeing the suffering thereof hath alreadie wounded the
									estate of true religion, dishonored his maiestie, disturbed the
									whole realme, and had almost disioined aswell the hearts of the
									princes as of the subiects of the two nations, we thinke it
									therefore high time, and we are in dutie and conscience (all
									doubt and perill set apart) to procure the separation and
									thrusting awaie of the said desperate and enorme persons from
									about his maiestie, that his highnesse being restored to his
									former libertie, maie freelie, peaceablie, and wiselie gouerne

									maie be once disburdened of the heauie oppressions and iniuries
									that they haue with no small greefe so long susteined, and the

								<p part="N">"Wherefore we command and charge (in our souereigne lords name)

					foorth of the castell vnto the lords of the religion, the maister of Greie his

					honor and estate, and to deliuer his maiestie out of their hands, who vnder his

					Wherefore they were onelie there assembled in the feare of God, and loue to his

				<p part="N">To the second point they answered, that where the liues of such were desired to

				<p part="N">Besides which at the returne of these commissioners, the nobilitie exhibited

					established by the estates, and so agree vnto the reformation of the premisses,
					&amp; that all the common holds &amp; strengths might be rendred into their
					hands to be kept as the councell of the ancient nobilitie should appoint, who
					were there in good number assembled. Secondlie, that the said disquieters of the
					common-wealth might be deliuered into their custodie, vntill they had receiued

					Arrane, and William Steward capteine of Dunbarton (who had beene taken in the

					interteinment in that countrie, returned home in December following. In which
					moneth there was a parlement called at Lithgo, for the full ratifieng and
					confirming of the restitution of these lords of the religion: at what time the
					earle of Arrane was displaced both from his earldome of Arrane, and office of
					chancellorship: and the earle of Bothwell was admitted to that office of lord
					chancellor. Besides <note place="marg" anchored="false">The earle Bothwell made

					Arrane, and committed to lohn lord Hamilton lord of Arbroth, and brother to the
					lunatike earle, sometime remaining in the wardship of the said Iohn Hamilton,
					before that the said lames Steward had gotten the possession of that lunatike
					earle into his owne hands, out of the custodie of the same Iohn Hamilton.</p>
				<p part="N">But somewhat to leaue the lunatike earle in safe keeping, we will speake a little
					of this <note place="marg" anchored="false">Iames Steward earle of Arrane married to the widow of

					who being a woman of delight of change in marriage, was (after the second

					of the earle of Atholl, was first married to the lord Louet. After which,
					iudging it better to marrie than to burne (although by the sequele of the same
					she felt small contentment therein) she bound hir selfe with the knot of
					matrimonie vnto Robert Steward earle of March and bishop of Cathnesse; but after
					finding occasion of diuorce, the contention and sute whereof continued verie
					long, from the said earle she was in the end separated; and then the third time
					bestowed hir selfe in marriage vpon this lames Steward earle of Arrane, by whome
					she had issue diuerse sonnes and daughters, the eldest whereof the king tooke

					sound peace betweene the nations of Denmarke and Scotland; which good seruice
					being well weied, he was after the death of lames the first, and in the entrance
					of Iames the second into the gouernment of Scotland, in the yeare of Christ
					1436, confirmed in his office of chancellorship, besides which he had the
					gouernment of the kings person, and of the castle of Edenburgh committed to his
					charge. Then by reason of contention which fell betweene sir Alexander

					taking in the yeare of Christ one thousand foure hundred thirtie and seuen,
					whereby insued much mischeefe and bloudshed in the realme (as alwaies by my

					chancellor, found means by subtiltie to get the king into hir possession out of
					the hands of the chancellor, after that she had handsomlie trussed vp the king
					in a troonke like a fardell full of apparell, wherevpon the gouernor besieged
					the chancellor in the castle of Edenburgh, but in the end they agreed that
					Creichton should still keepe the castle of Edenburgh and his office of
					chancellor.</p>
				<p part="N">That doone, in the yeare one thousand foure hundred thirtie and nine, and the
					third yeare of lames the second, the chancellor obteined to haue the queene
					Dowager, and hir husband Iames Steward lord of Lorne released out of the prison
					of Sterling, whither they were committed by the gouernor. Which doone the
					chancellor keeping in mind the deceit of the queene, in ouerreaching him, by
					getting the king out of his possession, and seeing the gouernor to take the
					whole authoritie on him at his pleasure, did so worke that he found meanes, that
					he onlie accompanied with foure and twentie persons, did againe get the king (as
					he was one morning hunting in Sterling parke) into his possession, whom he
					carried with him into the castle of Edenburgh, wherewith the gouernor was
					greeuouslie displeased, but not able to remedie the same, there was an agreement
					made betweene the chancellor and him, that the king should remaine in the
					custodie of the chancellor, and the gouernor continue his office in
					administrating the affaires of the realme. Wherevpon in the yeare of Christ one
					thousand foure hundred and fortie, and the fourth yeare of lames the second, the
					gouernor and the chancellor assemble a councell of the nobilitie at Edenburgh.
					In the yeare of Christ one thousand foure hundred fortie and foure, being the
					eight of the same lames the second, both the gouernor and the chancellor (at the
					persuasion of William earle Dowglas) were remooued from their offices by the
					king, who being now about fourteene yeres old, had taken the absolute gouernment
					of the kingdome vpon him: besides which they were also put from the councell,
					their friends were banished the court, and they were summoned to appeare before
					the king, which they refused, not as giltie in conscience, but as fearing the
					crueltie of their enimies, wherevpon they were proclaimed rebels and put to the
					horne, which occasioned William Dowglasse the chancellors great enimie to gather
					a power and spoile the lands of this William Creichton, for requitall wherof,
					Creichton gathered a like power, entred the land of Dowglasse, and spoiled the
					same all that he could, which thing adding further heat to the Dowglasse, caused
					him to procure the king in the yeare of Christ one thousand foure hundred fortie
					and fiue, being the ninth yeare of the kings reigne, to demand of Creichton the
					deliuerie of the castles of Edenburgh and of Creichton, which he denieng to doo
					vntill the king came to full age, had all his goods confscat, hauing therein no
					iniurie doone vnto him, for as saith Lesleus: "Primus omnium sanciuerat <note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Lesleus lib.</emph> 8. <emph>pag.</emph> 297.</note>
					Creichtonus, vt qui regi castrum aliquod postulanti restiterit, violatæ

					or castle to the king, as before you haue heard. But after as it seemeth, such
					is the mutahilitie of fortune, he returned into the kings grace, for which in
					the yeare of Christ one thousand foure hundred and fiftie, he was by the earle
					Dowglasse (supposing him to be the cause that the king misliked the earle)
					assaulted one morning as he was comming out of the castle of Edenburgh, from
					which although wounded, he escaped vnto his castle of Creichton, where in short
					space after he assembled a power, recouered Edenburgh from the Dowglasse, and
					had destroied the earle at that present, if he had not shifted awaie more
					speedilie: who being thus dishonorablie chased from Edenburgh, drew the erle of
					Crawford and Rosse to ioine with him against Creichton, but he little esteeming
					thereof and requiting good for euill, did in the yeare of Christ one thousand
					foure hundred fiftie and three, or a thousand foure hundred fiftie and foure as
					some haue, procure a pardon for the earle of Crawford, greeuouslie fallen into
					the kings displeasure. In which yeare also the king calling a parlement at
					Edenburgh, the earldome of Murreie was giuen to sir Iames Creichton, or rather
					restored to him, from whom it had beene wrongfullie taken by the iniust sentence
					of William earle of Dowglasse, who had procured it to be assigned to his brother
					Archibald Dowglasse, although the right remained in the same sir Iames
					Creichton. But yet when the same sir Iames could not keepe that earledome
					without the enuie of diuers persons, he surrendred the same into the kings
					hands. Beside all which at this parlement was George Creichton created earle of
					Cathnesse, which I thought good to note in this place, because it touched the

					that towne, whereby great dissention and part taking was raised amongst the

					noble men of the realme, kept the towne of Glascow; but after that, this
					chancellor who would not come to Edenburgh, the king of England and of France
					their ambassadors came to Sterling, where a peace was proclamed amongst the
					nobilitie.</p>
				<p part="N">But what can long continue in one staie, or what peace will be long imbraced

					Whereof the earle, to reuenge the same, did with the king, in the yeare of

					which Beton cardinall, thus the same Onuphrius writeth: "Dauid de sancto Andrea
					Scotus episcopus Miropiensis presbyter cardinalis tituli sancti Stephani in
					Cælio monte creatus, anno Domini, 1538, 13 kalend. Ianuar. per Paulum tertiū,
					anno pontificatus 13." In which words Onuphrius, and Lesleus following him,
					refer the creation of this cardinall vnto the yeare one thousand fiue hundred
					thirtie and eight, though others attribute it to the yeare one thousand fiue
					hundred thirtie and seuen. In which yeare one thousand fiue hundred thirtie and
					eight, he was with others sent ambassador into France after the death of the
					quéene, to procure Marie of Lorreine widow duchesse of Longuile, and daughter to

					earle of Arrane to that function; by meanes whereof, there fell continuall
					dissentions betwéene the nobilitie, which ended not vntill this cardinall was
					slaine as after it shall appeare. For shortlie after in the said yeare one

					gouernors appointment he was remoued to his owne castell of S. Andrews, hauing
					watch and ward about him, to see him safelie kept, in which place also he did
					not long continue: for corrupting his keepers he found meanes to escape; which

					the gouernor to leaue the part of the king of England, and wholie to become
					French.</p>
				<p part="N">Now at the coronation, the cardinall ordered all things, appointing euerie
					officer, and growing into great credit, did in like sort at other times dispose
					of the common-wealth as séemed best liking vnto him. Wherevpon, the earle of
					Leneux taking part with the English, opposed himselfe against the gouernor and
					the cardinall, whereby followed sharpe warres, the cardinall still supporting
					and counselling the gouernor: which troubles being somewhat abated, by reason
					the earle of Leneux was gone into England, the cardinall in the yeare of Christ
					one thousand foure hundred fortie and foure, receiued the patriarch of Ierusalem
					arriued in Scotland. In which meane time, there was great contention betwéene
					the cardinall and the archbishop of Glascow, for bearing their crosses in the
					others iurisdiction: wherevpon they fell from words to swords, which the
					gouernor appeased: that doone, the patriarch the popes legat comming to Rome,
					procured the legantine power to be granted to this cardinall, which he long
					inioied not. For being greatlie enuied by reason of these honors &amp; some
					gréeuous facts, certeine persons in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred fortie
					and six (after that he had burned George Wischart a learned man, condemned at
					saint Andrews by an assemblie of bishops) did the thirtéenth daie of Maie (when
					they had secretlie in the morning entered the castell of saint Andrews where the
					cardinall was) expell the porters of the foresaid castell, the cardinals
					seruants, and slue the cardinall naked as he came to méete them, whose death sir
					Iames Liermount prouost of saint Andrews thought to haue staied by assembling a
					power therefore: but after that he saw the cardinals dead bodie hanged out ouer
					the wals, he made no further attempt. The death of which cardinall comming to
					the gouernors eares, he banished the author thereof, as writeth Lesleus in these

				<p part="N">After that the queene mother had bin in France, she in the same yeare of Christ

					For besides that Lesleus saith that he was restored to all his dignities (except

				<p part="N">After this, in the yeare of Christ one thousand fiue hundred thrée score and two,

					imbraced the abolished doctrine of the pope, &amp; set vp the ceremonie of
					Italic. Amongst whome, one, not of the meanest, the lord Maxwell, who <note place="marg" anchored="false">The lord Maxwell beareth masse.</note> had maried the earle of
					Angus his sister, did in Ianuarie aduance the same, and heard masse at
					Linclouden a mile from Dumfries, contrarie to the publike laws appointed in
					Scotland. Wherof intelligence being brought vnto the king, he forthwith
					dispatched a messenger vnto him, commanding him to surcease the same. But the
					lord Maxwell persisting in that his former action, was (in the end apprehended,
					and vpon the refusall of an oth touching the same, according to the lawes of
					Scotland) committed to prison in Edenburgh, where he long remained.</p>
				<p part="N">These things thus doone in Scotland, the aforenamed maister Keith departed from

					D'annauall had at this time small interteinment in Scotland; where not staieng
					long after that Randolph was come into England, he also came hither out of
					Scotland, to the end to passe through this countrie into France. This summer
					Montgomerie erle of Eglinton, whose father died not manie yeares before, hauing
					married the daughter of the lord Boid was slaine in this sort. The earle being a
					goodlie yoong gentleman, and like to prooue a good member of his countrie, as
					manie of his ancestors had doone before, did for his delight ride foorth on
					hunting (a warlike exercise, &amp; much vsed by the Scots) about fiue or six
					miles frŌ his owne castell, where hauing satisfied his pleasure, he returned
					home. But hauing wait laid for him by an ambush of his enimies, he was in his
					iorneie towards his castell intercepted by the lord of Glencarns brother, with
					the lards of Hacket and Robertslands, and some of the surnames of the Muirs; at
					what time he was most miserablie slaine by them to their great dishonor, and his
					countries discommoditie. After which, in September Archibald Dowglasse (who as
					you heard before departing this realme in Aprill last, was admitted to come into
					his owne countrie) was sent ambassador from the king of Scots to the quéene of
					England; in whose companie were attendant on him William Murro one of the kings
					chamber, and Richard Dowglasse nephue vnto the same Archibald. Which ambassador
					after his comming into England, had full audience at the court then remaining at
					Windsore, on the sixt of the same moneth of September, with whome remaining
					still here in England, at the writing hereof, expecting the end of his
					ambassage; I will set end to this slender discourse. Thus hauing patched vp a
					Rapsodie of some few things doone in Scotland since the yeare of our Lord one
					thousand fiue hundred seuentie and one, in which I began my annals of that

					set downe before, with a catalog of such writers of Scotland, as either by mine
					owne search in histories, or by others intelligence by conference haue come vnto

					that course in Scotland which I haue doone in my additions to the historie of
					England, first written by Raphaell Holinshed. For hauing there closed vp that
					historie with a generall catalog of all such as haue written anie thing
					concerning England, so will I wrap vp these annals of Scotland, much after that
					manner, with a generall discourse of the writers of that countrie. In dooing
					whereof I haue not refused to follow the order of Lesleus and other
					historiographers of Scotland, obseruing the like course in the repetition of the
					names of a few persons at the end of most of their kings.</p>

					taking from other that which is their due. For I doo verelie suppose, that manie
					of those men so termed Scots were Irishmen borne. For vntill late yeres a little
