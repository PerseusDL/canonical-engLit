<p part="N">AMONG all the infinit good blessings, right honorable, which the Lord God
hath bestowed vpon vs, I thinke none more expedient and necessarie, than the
vse and knowledge of histories and chronicles: which are the most assured registers
of the innumerable benefits and commodities, which haue and dailie doo grow to
the church of God, and to the ciuill gouernment through out all nations. The vse
<note place="marg" anchored="false">The first vse of histories.</note>
of them began and was receiued euen from the first beginning, and mmediatlie
vpon the dispersing of the sonnes of Adam through out the world: for they were
no sooner diuided into seuerall nations, but they did (as Cicero saith) make
choise of some one man among themselues, who surpassed the rest in wisedome,
knowledge and vnderstanding, <emph>Ad quem confugiebant.</emph> These kind of men or the
<note place="marg" anchored="false">The first chronographers.</note>
most part in those daies were preests and philosophers, and for their great knowledge,
wisedome and credit, had the charge to commend to their posteritie such
notable and good acts as were woorthie the memorie. And as all other nations had
such men, so the remote Ilands in the great Ocean had the like. For Britaine,
<note place="marg" anchored="false">The first chronographers in England and Ireland.</note>
now conteining England, Scotland and Wales, had their Druides and Bardos, and
Ireland had their Odalies or Rimers, who being verie wise men &amp; of great credit,
did deliuer all their saiengs in meeter, and were therefore called Poets. And these
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Poets were the first chronographers in Britaine.</note>
for the better alluring of the people to attention, and to frame them to the knowledge
of vertue, did vse to sing with an instrument such lessons and instructions
as they were woont to giue, whether it were concerning manners and common conuersation,
or matters of policie and gouernment, or of prowesse and martiall affaires,
or of the gests of their ancestors, or of anie other thing thought meet to be
learned and woorthie the knowledge, by which meanes they made men the more apt,
readie, and willing to applie themselues to vertue and to a commendable course of
life, both concerning God how he was to be honored, the magistrate how he was
to be obeied, &amp; the common societie how it was to be conserued; and finallie how
the whole course of mans life was to be ordered and directed. These and manie
<note place="marg" anchored="false">The definition of an historie.</note>

<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Cicero de oratore.</emph></note>
other like commodities when Cicero had considered, did grow by these means,
which is the verie substance of an historie: he described the same to be the witnesse
of time, the light of truth, the life of memorie, and the mistresse of life:

willing and aduising euerie man at all times and in all matters to haue their recours
to the same, and to be well exercised in the knowledge thereof, bicause the thing
past are set downe therin, and by them a man may learne what to doo in the life to
come. For as the wise man saith, There is nothing new vnder the sunne: for the
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Ecclesiast.</emph> 1.3.</note>
thing which is now hath beene, and by the things past we are taught the things to
come. And so saith Augustine: Historia magis vel certe non minús prænunciandis
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>August de ciuit.</emph></note>

<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Dei.</emph></note>
futuris, quàm enunciandis præteritis inuentur intenta:" Histories doo teach and aduertise
vs as well of the things to come, as of the things past: and the knowledge
thereof is fo no necessarie that Melancthon would haue no man to be vnlearned in
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Chronica Carionis.</emph></note>

<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Thucidides.</emph></note>
histories, bicause "Sine qua nulla in re quispiam lucem habet." And Thucidides the
old ancient historiographer of Grecia would that euerie man should haue about him
a booke of histories, as a thing most necessarie for him in all matters whatsoeuer:
and this did he draw and learne (as it should seeme) from Moses, who when he had
faithfullie and diligentlie written and set downe the whole course of the world, the
woonderfull works of God, and all the most necessarie precepts and rules for mans
life, either concerning matters of religion or causes of ciuill policies, or of common
societie: then he and Iosua assembling all the people togither, did deliuer vnto
them the whole Pentatychon of Moses to be dailie read &amp; taught, with a commandement
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Deutero.</emph> 5.</note>

<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Iosue.</emph> 1.</note>
that they should neuer haue that booke out of their hands, but to haue alwaies
their continuall recourse to them, as well for their life, as also for their direction
in all their causes. Which thing they did most diligentlie obserue and
keepe, and not onelie in matters of religion, but in all doubtfull matters, as to
the most true oracles, they would make their recourse for their full resolutions. As
the enimies of Iehuda, when they saw the prosperous successe of the building of
the temple in the times of Ezras and Nehemias, and they much maligning the
<note place="marg" anchored="false">1. <emph>Esdras.</emph> 4.</note>

<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Nehemias.</emph></note>
same, made sute to king Artaxerxes that he would reuoke the decree which king
Cyrus had made vnto the Iewes, licencing them to build the temple, alledging manie
great and sundrie matters against them. Wherevpon the king commanded the
chronicles to be searched, whether it were true that had beene informed against
them. Likewise when Hamon had greeuouslie complained vnto king Ahasuerus
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Esther.</emph> 6.</note>
against Mardocheus and the Iewes, charging them with sundrie hainous offenses
worthie death, the king commanded the chronicles to be searched. Also when
Paule and Sylas first preached the gospell at Thessalonica and Bærea, a doctrine
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Acts.</emph> 17.</note>
then accompted strange and new, they searched and examined the books "Num hæc
ita se haberent." For as they found things there recorded, so gaue they credit, and by
the same they did proceed in the like. For it was a common thing among the Romans,
that not onelie they would make recourse in all doubtfull matters to their owne annales:
but what so euer they found in the like in anie other nation or commonwealth,
which might further them in anie thing touching their owne affaires, they
would draw the same into an example for themselues to follow, which was no small
benefit to their commonwealth.</p>
<p part="N">Likewise Alexander the great, notwithstanding he were brought vp in all good
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Alexander.</note>
letters vnder Aristotle, yet when he was to inlarge his empire, he gaue himselfe to
the diligent reading of Homer, the most exact chronographer of the Troian wars:
and so he esteemed that booke, that in the daie time he caried it about him, and
in the night time he laid it vnder his beds head; and at all times conuenient he
would be reading of it, and in the end was so perfect therein, that he could verbatim
repeat the whole without booke; the stratagems, the policies, and the manie
deuises vsed in those warres he practised in his owne warres, which stood him in great
steed. Iulius Cæsar also in his wars searched the ancient bookes and histories of
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Iulius Cæsar.</note>
the citie of Rome: and did not onelie thereby draw a paterne for his owne direction,
both for his ciuill and his martiall affaires: but also, he being then the greatest

monarch of all the world, thought it not preiudiciall to his imperiall estate and maiestie,
to commend vnder his owne hand writing vnto his posteritie, the historie
of his owne age and dooings. Manie like princes hath England bred, who haue
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Mat. Parisiensis in prefat.</emph></note>
bin verie carefull, that the memoriall of the good things doone in their times should
be commended to their posteritie, to follow in the like. And therefore euerie king
for the course of sundrie hundreds of yeares, was woont to reteine and keepe some
wise, learned, and faithfull scribes, who should collect and record the things doone
in euerie their seuerall times, and all which as time and course of yeares did serue,
were published; and what great good benefits haue growne thereby to this present
age, and like to serue to the future time, all the world maie easilie see and iudge:
for this I dare boldlie saie and affirme: No realme, no nation, no state, nor common
wealth throughout all Europa, can yeeld more nor so manie profitable lawes,
directions, rules, examples &amp; discourses, either in matters of religion, or of ciuill
gouernment, or of martiall affairs, than doo the histories of this little Isle of Britaine
or England. I would to God I might or were able to saie the like, or the
halfe like of Ireland, a countrie, the more barren of good things, the more replenished
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Ireland yeeldeth small matter for an historie.</note>
with actions of bloud, murther, and lothsome outrages; which to anie
good reader are greeuous &amp; irkesome to be read &amp; considered, much more for
anie man to pen and set downe in writing, and to reduce into an historie. Which
hath beene some cause whie I was alienated and vtterlie discouraged to intermedle
therein: for being earnestlie requested, by reason of my some acquaintance with
the maners and conditions of that nation during my short abode therein, to continue
the historie of that land, from the death of king Henrie the eight vnto these
presents, which hitherto hath not beene touched; I found no matter of an historie
woorthie to be recorded: but rather a tragedie of cruelties to be abhorred, and no
historie of good things to be followed: and therefore I gaue the matter ouer, and
was fullie resolued not at all to haue intermedled therewith. Neuerthelesse, being
againe verie earnestlie requested, and no excuse neither of my age, nor of my often
sicknesse, nor of my calling in the seruice of the commonwelth, nor of my small
learning and skill, sufficient to compas such a matter, could be accepted: then
(but with an euill will) I entred into it, and the more I bethought my selfe of the
matter, the more I began to consider, and at length to behold the too great and
woonderous workes of God, both of his seuere iudgement against traitors, rebels,
<note place="marg" anchored="false">The iustice of God against rebels.</note>
and disobedient; and of his mercie and louing kindnesse vpon the obedient and
dutifull. Whereof, though there be infinite examples both in the sacred histories
and humane chronicles: yet I find none more apparant and effectuall, nor more
fit for vs, and for this our time and age, than the histories of our owne nation,
which yeeld vnto vs most infinite examples, how yoong princes rebelling against
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Hen. 2.</note>

<note place="marg" anchored="false">Edw. 2.</note>
the kings their fathers, noble men against their souereignes, and the commons
against the kings and rulers, some by the mightie hand of God swallowed vp ii.
the seas, some deuoured with the swoord, some by martiall and some by ciuill
lawes executed to death: and few or none which haue escaped vnpunished. But
of all others, none to be compared to this tragicall discourse of Ireland, and the
most vnnaturall wars of the Desmonds against hir sacred maiestie. Whose disobedience
the Lord hath in iustice so seuerelie punished and reuenged, as the like
hath not in our age beene seene nor knowne; which albeit somewhat at large it
be set downe in the historie, yet breefelie and in effect is as followeth.</p>
<p part="N">The earle of Desmond, named Girald Fitzgirald, was descended of a yoonger
house of the Giraldines of Kildare, and both of them descended from one and the
same ancestor Girald of Windsor a noble gentleman of Normandie; who after
his arriuall into England, trauelled into Wales, and there maried the ladie Nesta
daughter to the great Roesines prince of south Wales, and by hir among others

had issue Moris Fitzgirald, ancestor to these the foresaid Giraldines; and he being
assistant to Derman mac Morogh king of Leinster in Ireland, was one of the
cheetest and most principall seruitors in the conquest, or rather one of the conquerors
of that land vnder king Henrie the second. The issue and ofspring of this
Moris as they were honourable in blood, so they were no lesse honorable in all
their actions: they being verie famous for their good gifts of the mind, in wisedome
and policie in their ciuill gouernment, and renowmed for their valiantnesse
and prowesse in martiall affaires, in both which they had well tried themselues, and
therefore manie times they had the cheefe gouernment of the whole realme, being
sometime lord iustices, sometime lord lieutenants, and sometime lord Deputies of
the whole land. And for their truth and fidelitie were aduanced to honor. For
Thomas Fitzgirald being the elder house, was created earle of Kildare in the eighteenth
yeare of king Edward the first, in the yeare one thousand two hundred foure
score and nine. And in the beginning of king Edward the third his reigne, in the
yeare one thousand three hundred twentie and seuen, Moris Fitzthomas a yoonger
brother of that house was created earle of Desmond; and from thense as before,
they continued verie honourable, dutifull &amp; faithfull subiects, for the course of
sundrie hundreds of yeares: vntill that this brainesicke and breakedanse Girald of
Desmond, and his brethren, alies, and complices, forgetting the honour of his
house, and forsaking their faith, dutie and alegiance, did breake into treasons,
and shewed themselues open enimies, traitors and rebels, vsing all maner of hostilities
and outrages, to the impeach of hir most sacred maiestie, and the destruction
of the commonwelth: the price whereof in the end he paied with his and their
own bloods, to the vtter destruction of themselues and that whole familie, there
being verie few Giraldines in the prouince of Mounster left to bemone or bewaile their
deaths. For first the earle himselfe, the cheefe of his familie, after his long repast
in his traitorous follies, was driuen in the end to all extremities and penuries, and
at the last taken in an old cotage, and his head was cut off and sent to London,
and there set vpon London bridge, and his lands and inheritance confiscated and
discontinued from his house and name for euer. Sir lames one of his yoonger brethren,
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Sir Iames of Desmond taken and hanged.</note>
in taking of a preie, was taken and made a preie; he was hanged as a theefe,
quartered as a traitor, and his head and quarters dispersed and set vpon the gates
and wals of the citie of Corke. Sir Iohn of Desmond, an other of his yoonger
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Sir Iohn of Desmond killed and hanged.</note>
brethren, and next to himselfe the cheefe ringleader of this rebellion, was taken,
his head cut off and set vpon the castell of Dublin, and his bodie hanged by the
heeles at Corke. His onelie sonne and heire being wholie disinherited, is prisoner

all for the most part to the swoord. The popes two prelats and nuncios, the
one slaine in the field, and the other died most miserablie in the woods. The Italians
and strangers few or none left aliue to returne to aduertise of their successe
vnto their holie father. The common people such as escaped the swoord, all for
the most part are perished with famine, or fled the countrie. The land it selfe
<note place="marg" anchored="false">The land left altogither baren.</note>
being verie fertile, is waxed baren, yeelding nor corne nor fruits; the pastures

and he shall receiue iudgement. And the Lord shall root him from out of
the face of the earth that shall blaspheme his gods, and curseth the prince of the
people. Euen as of the contrarie, when the people liue in all subiection, humblenesse,
and obedience, the Lord defendeth and keepeth them, and with his manifold
blessings prospereth them; as hir maiesties good subiects dwelling within the English

pale, and inhabiting within hir cities and townes can witnesse. They sow and
till the land, and doo reape the fruits. Their fields are full of sheepe, and they are
clothed with the wooll. Their pastures are full of cattell, and they inioie them.
Their cities and townes are well inhabited, and they liue in safetie. All things go
well with them, and peace and plentie resteth in their houses. Two notable examples
(I saie) and woorthie to be throughlie obserued; the one of Gods iust iudgement
against the rebels and traitors, and the other of mercie and loue towards the
obedient and dutifull subiect. Which examples the later they are, the more should
they imprint in vs an inward affection and an vndoubted resolution, to yeeld to the
superiours all dutie and obedience: and by the examples of the rehels, to shun as
a pestilence all disobedience and rebellion; least in dooing the like, we doo receiue
the like iust iudgements with them. Let therefore the examples of the elders be
sufficient persuasions and instructions to the posteritie, to follow that which is good,
and to eschew that which is euill. For albeit good counsell of our friends, and
conferences with the good men, maie much preuaile with vs, yet none can so much
preuaile nor be of such vertue and effect, as the examples of our ancestors, and
the actions of ourforefa thers when they be laid before vs: "Magis enim exemplis potest
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Patric. de instit reip.</emph></note>
persuaderi, quâm argumentis extorqueri." And therfore in times past, the surest
course which our forefathers tooke, either in ciuill gouernment or in martiall affaires,
was that which they drew from the examples of their ancestors before them. And
for as much as such is the value and vertue of the footsteps of our forefathers, I
trust it shall not be offensiue vnto you, that I doo a little digresse and speake somewhat
of your selfe and of your ancestors; who the more honourable they were in
their times, the greater cause haue you to looke into the same: that what in some
of your later forefathers was consopited, maie not in you be consepulted, but rouzed
and raised vnto his former and pristinat state. And for as much as I am somewhat
acquainted in their descents, let me make bold with you to laie the same downe before
you.</p>
<p part="N">There were sundrie of your ancestors by the name of Raleigh, who were of
<note place="marg" anchored="false">The descent of the lord warden.</note>
great account &amp; nobilitie, and alied as well to the Courtneis earls of Deuon, as to
other houses of great honour &amp; nobilitie, &amp; in sundrie succeeding descents were
honoured with the degree of knighthood. One of them being your ancestor in the
directest line, was named sir Iohn de Raleigh, who then dwelled in the house of
Furdell in Deuon, an ancient house of your ancestors, and of their ancient inheritance:
and which at these presents is in the possession of your eldest brother. This
knight maried the daughter and heire to sir Roger D'amerei, or de Amerei, whome
our English chronicles doo name lord de Amereie, who was a noble man and of great
linage, and descended of the earls de Amereie in Britaine, and alied to the earls of
Montfort in the same duchie and prouince. This man being come ouer into England,
did serue in the court, and by the good pleasure of God and the good liking
of the king he maried the ladie Elisabeth, the third sister and coheire to the
noble Gilbert earle of Clare and of Glocester, who was slaine in the battell of Banokesborough
in Scotland, in the time of king Edward the second. This earle died
sans issue, he being the sonne and the said ladie Elisabeth the daughter to Gilbert
de Clare earle of Glocester, by his wife the ladie Iane de Acres or Acon, daughter
to king Edward the first. This Gilbert descended of Robert earle of Glocester,
sonne to king Henrie the first, and of his wife the ladie Mawd, daughter and heire

to Robert Fitzhamon, lord of Astrouill in Normandie, coosen to the Conquetor,
knight of the priuie chamber to king William Rufus, and lord of the lordship of
Glamorgan in Wales. So that your ancestor sir Iohn de Raleigh married the
daughter of de Amerie, Damereie of Clare, Clare of Edward the first, and which
Clare by his father descended of king Henrie the first. And in like maner by your
mother you maie be deriued out of the same house. These all were men of great
honour and nobilitie, and whose vertues are highlie recorded sparsim in the chronicles
of England; some greatlie commended for their wisedomes and deepe iudgements
in matters of counsell, some likewise much praised for their prowesse &amp; valiantnesse
in martiall affaires, and manie of them honored for both.</p>
<p part="N">But yet as nothing is permanent in this life, and all things variable vnder the
sunne, and time hath deuoured and consumed the greatest men and the mightiest
monarchs, and most noble commonwealths in the world, according to the old
countrie saieng; Be the daie neuer so long, yet at length it will ring at euensong:
<note place="marg" anchored="false">All things haue an end.</note>
so this honorable race, though for so manie descents, and for the course of so manie
yeares it continued in great honor, nobilitie, and reputation, yet in processe of
time the honour became to be of worship (neuerthelesse alied alwaies and matched
in houses of great honour and nobilitie) and so euer since possessed by knights of
your owne name, vntill by little and little the honour and estimation of your noble
and worthie ancestors seemed at length to be buried in obliuion, and as it were
extinguished and to be vtterlie forgotten as though it had neuer beene. And
now when all was past anie hope and vnremembred to the world, it hath pleased
God to raise the same euen as it were from the dead, and to looke vpon you the
yoongest sonne of manie, as he did vpon Ioseph, one of the yoongest sonnes of
Iacob; and in you hath left a hope to restore the decaied house of your sept and
familie. He hath brought you into the good fauour of your prince, who hath
pleased to reward and honour in you the approoued faithfull seruice of your late
ancestors and kindered deceassed, and inclined hir princelie hart, conceiuing a
great hope of your owne sufficiencie and abilitie to restore you againe, being the
last branch remaining of so manie noble and famous houses descended. And
whereof commeth this, that the Lord hath thus blessed you, and so bountifullie
hath dealt with you? but onelie (as the wise man saith) "Vt noscas in omni virtute
omnibus prodesse," and that you should be beneficiall and profitable to all men. And
therefore in all our actions, "Semper aliquid ad communem vtilitatem est afferendum:"
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Cicero de offic.</emph></note>
for we are not borne to our selues alone, but the prince, the countrie, the parents,
freends, wiues, children and familie, euerie of them doo claime an interest in vs, and
to euerie of them we must be beneficiall: otherwise we doo degenerate from that
communitie and societie, which by such offices by vs is to be conserued, &amp; doo
become most vnprofitable: "Nam inutilis prorsus est, qui nullam vtilitatem reipublices
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Cicero.</emph></note>
ac communi societati possit afferre," and euerie such man, as a member vnprofitable
is to be cut off. And as the bee is no longer suffered to haue a place in the hiue,
than whiles he worketh; no more is that man to haue place in the publike weale
than whiles he dooth some good therein, bicause through idlenesse they doo not
onelie no good, but as Cato saith, they doo euill: "Nihil agendo homines malè agere
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Cato.</emph></note>

<note place="marg" anchored="false">Idlers ought not to haue place in the commonwealth.</note>
discunt." Idlenesse therefore the mother of all wickednesse, and idlers the sonnes
of so bad a mother, are vtterlie to be exiled and expelled out of all well gouerned
commonweales; and they onelie to be fostered, nourished and cherished, who as
they are borne to the countrie, so if they doo good and be beneficiall to the same.</p>
<p part="N">And how great your care hath beene heerein, the course of your life hitherto
dooth manifest it. For after that you had seasoned your primer yeares at Oxford
in knowledge and learning, a good ground and a sure foundation to build therevpon
all your good actions, you trauelled into France, and spent there a good part

of your youth in the warres and martiall seruices. And hauing some sufficient
knowledge and experience therein, then after your returne from thense, to the end
you might euerie waie be able to serue your prince and commonweale, you were
desirous to be acquainted in maritimall affaires. Then you, togither with your
brother sir Humfreie Gilbert, trauelled the seas, for the search of such countries, as
which if they had beene then discouered, infinit commodities in sundrie respects
would haue insued, and whereof there was no doubt, if the fleet then accompanieng
you, had according to appointment followed you, or your selfe had escaped
the dangerous sea fight, when manie of your companie were slaine, and your ships
therewith also sore battered and disabled. And albeit this hard beginning (after
which followed the death of the said woorthie knight your brother) was a matter
sufficient to haue discouraged a man of a right good stomach and value from anie
like seas attempts; yet you, more respecting the good ends, wherevnto you leuelled
your line for the good of your countrie, did not giue ouer, vntill you had recouered
a land, and made a plantation of the people of your owne English nation in
Virginia, the first English colonie that euer was there planted, to the no little derogation
of the glorie of the Spaniards, &amp; an impeach to their vaunts; who bicause
with all cruell immanitie, contrarie to all naturall humanitie, they subdued a naked
and a yeelding people, whom they sought for gaine and not for anie religion or
plantation of a commonwelth, ouer whome to satisfie their most greedie and insatiable
couetousnesse, did most cruellie tyrannize, and most tyrannicallie and against
the course of all humane nature did scorch and rost them to death, as by their
owne histories dooth appeare. These (I saie) doo brag and vaunt, that they onelie
haue drawne strange nations and vnknowne people, to the obedience of their kings,
to the knowledge of christianitie, and to the inriching of their countrie, and
thereby doo claime the honor to be due to themselues onelie and alone. But if
these your actions were well looked into, with such due consideration as apperteineth,
it shall be found much more honorable in sundrie respects, for the aduancement
of the name of God, the honour of the prince, and the benefit of the
common wealth. For what can be more pleasant to God, than to gaine and reduce
in all christianlike manner, a lost people to the knowledge of the gospell, and a
true christian religion, than which cannot be a more pleasant and a sweet sacrifice,
and a more acceptable seruice before God? And what can be more honorable to
princes, than to inlarge the bounds of their kingdoms without iniurie, wrong, &amp;
bloudshed; and to frame them from a sauage life to a ciuill gouernment, neither
of which the Spaniards in their conquests haue performed? And what can be more
beneficiall to a common weale, than to haue a nation and a kingdome to transferre
vnto the superfluous multitude of frutelesse and idle people (heere at home dailie increasing)
co trauell, conquer, and manure another land, which by the due intercourses
to be deuised, may and will yeeld infinit commodities? And how well you
doo deserue euerie waie in following so honourable a course, not we our selues
onelie can witnesse, but strange nations also doo honour you for the same: as
dooth appeare by the epistle of Bassimerus of France, to the historie of Florida:
and by Iulius Cæsar a citizen of Rome in his epistle to his booke intituled "Cullombeados."
It is well knowne, that it had beene no lesse easie for you, than for
such as haue beene aduanced by kings, to haue builded great houses, purchased
large circuits, and to haue vsed the fruits of princes fauours, as most men in all
former and present ages haue doone; had you not preferred the generall honour
and commoditie of your prince and countrie before all priuat gaine and commoditie:
wherby you haue beene rather a seruant than a commander to your owne
fortune. And no doubt the cause being so good, and the attempt so honorable,
but that God will increase your talent, and blesse your dooings, and euerie good

man will commend and further the same. And albeit the more noble enterprises a
man shall take in hand, the more aduersaries he shall haue to depraue and hinder
the same: yet I am persuaded, as no good man shall haue iust cause, so there is
none so much carried with a corrupt mind, nor so enuious of his countries honour,
nor so bent against you, that he will derogate the praise and honour due to so
worthie an enterprise; and that so much the sooner, bicause you haue indured so
manie crosses, and haue through so much enuiengs and misfortunes perseuered in
your attempts, which no doubt shall at last by you be performed when it shall
please him, who hath made you an instrument of so worthie a worke. And by how
much the more God hath pleased thus to blesse you, so much the more are you
bound to be thankefull vnto him, and to acknowledge the same to proceed from his
grace and mercie towards you. Giue me leaue therefore (I praie you) to be bold
with you, not onelie to put you in mind hereof, but also to remember you, how it
hath pleased God to bring you into the fauour of your prince and souereigne: who
besides hir great fauour towards you manie waies, she hath also laid vpon you the
charge of a gouernement in your owne countrie, where you are to command manie
people by your honourable office of the stannarie, and where you are both a iudge
and chancellor, to rule in iustice and to iudge in equitie. Wherin you are so much
the more to be circumspect and wise, bicause vpon your iudgement (and such as
you shall appoint to be vnder you) the determinations of all their causes dooth rest
and depend, knowing that a hard iudgement abideth for such as be in authoritie, if
they iudge not vprightlie, and doo not yeeld iustice to euerie man indifferentlie.
But you therefore carefull in this respect, that you be well reported for your vpright
dealings, both herein, &amp; ineuerie of all your other actions to all men. Be you a
patterne of vertue, &amp; an example of true nobilitie, which is grounded &amp; hath hir
foundation vpon vertue, for as the poet saith, "Ex virtute nobilitas nascitur, non
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Palingenius.</emph></note>
ex nobilitate virtus: virtus sola nobilitat, nŌ caro nec sanguis." And therfore saith
Demosthenes; If thou draw thy descent &amp; pedegree euen from Iupiter himselfe,
<note place="marg" anchored="false"><emph>Demosthenes.</emph></note>
yet if thou be not vertuous, iust &amp; good, <emph>Ignobilis mihi videris.</emph> In my opinion
thou art no gentleman. It is a noble thing to be borne of noble ancestors (as Aristotle
saith) but his nobilitie faileth, when his ancestors vertues in him faileth, "Hic
enim verè nobilis est cēsendus, cui non aliena sed sua virtus ad gloriam opitulatur."
Your ancestors were verie ancient, and men of great nobilitie, beneficiall to their
princes and countrie manie &amp; sundrie waies. And as in nature you are descended
from them, so it hath pleased God to blesse you with knowledge in learning, with
skill of warlike seruice, and in experience in maritimall causes, and besides hath
placed you among the nobles, and in the good grace and fauour of your prince.
Wherefore you are so much the more to be carefull to restore the house of your
decaied forefathers to their ancient honor and nobilitie, which in this later age hath
beene obscured, abiding the time by you to be restored to their first and primer
state: which you are not onelie taught by their old and good examples, but also
by the ensignes of their and your nobilitie. For the fusils, being an instrument of
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Fusils, instruments of labours.</note>
trauell and labour, doo aduertise you, that you are one of the sonnes of Adam,
borne to walke in a vocation, and therein to be a profitable member in the church
of God, and in maintenance of the common societie: which when you behold
and looke vpon, you must so endeuour your selfe, enen as Agathocles king of

Syracusa, whose cupbords, though they were well furnished with great store and
varietie of rich plate, yet he thought not the same sufficientlie fraughted, vnlesse
he had also his earthen pitchers and stone cups, in which he vsed to drinke, to
teach &amp; remember him in the middle of his roialtie, to be mindfull of his origin
estate and dutie.</p>

For as siluer is a most excellent mettall, and next vnto gold excelling all
others, and with which for the excellencie thereof, the Lord God would haue his
tabernacle and his temple to be adorned and beautified with vessels and ornaments
thereof; and as the white colour, if it be spotted and foule, dooth lose his grace:
euen so it teacheth you to be a man of an honest and of a godlie conuersation, to
lead a life in all vprightnesse, without reproch and disgrace: and that you should
be seruiceable to God and your countrie in all good actions; and therewith also
(which by the gulie colour is meant) you be bold and valiant for the defense of
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Gules.</note>
your countrie, and for the safetie thereof to spend both life and goods, that you
should be beneficiall to all men, hurtfull and iniurious to no man. And such kind
of men were your ancestors, who for the same were beloued and honoured, and
their names for euer registred in immortall fame and memorie. And so shall it be
with you, if you doo the like, and follow their steps and examples, God shall blesse
you, &amp; you shall prosper &amp; florish as did Ioseph; you shall be honored, as was
Daniell; and you shall be in fauor before God &amp; man, as were your ancestors; the
whole people shall speake good of you, the honour of your house shall be restored,
&amp; your talent shall be augmented &amp; increased, &amp; all things shall go well with you.
But to returne where we left. When I had waded as far as I could in the discourse
of this historie, according to such instructions as partlie by my selfe, but more by
other mens helps, I had collected and gathered; and thought to haue continued
the same from the death of King Henrie the eight, vnto these presents: it came vnto
my mind and I thought it verie expedient, to make a new review of that, which by
others had beene doone in the interuall betweene Cambrensis and my dooings,
wherein I found great paines had beene taken, and that the authors had well deserued
great praises and commendations. And yet in this they were much to be
<note place="marg" anchored="false">The ingratefulnesse vnto Cambrensis.</note>
blamed, that all of them were beholding vnto Giraldus, and not one of them would
yeeld that curtesie either to publish his historie, or vsing the same to acknowledge
it. For some misliking both method and phrase, framed it into another forme, and
penned it in a more loftie stile; and vnder that colour haue attributed vnto themselues
the honour and fruits of another mans doings. In which, their discourtesie
was the more, because they iniured so noble and woorthie a personage. For
Giraldus was a noble man by birth, he being the sonne vnto Mauricius, the sonne
<note place="marg" anchored="false">The genealogie of Giraldus.</note>
vnto Giraldus de Windsor, and to his wife the ladie Nesta, daughter to the great
Roesius prince of south Wales. He was from his youth brought vp in learning, and
prooued verie well learned in all good letters both diuine and likewise humane: and
by profession he was a man of the clergie, and liued by the patrimonie of the
church. He was chapleine to king Henrie the second, and to king Iohn his sonne,
and both of them he attended in their iorneis into Ireland, and at the request and
commandement of the king the father, he wrot the historie of this land according as
what he saw and knew to be true. The more noble then that this man was by
birth, the more reuerend in calling, the more painfull in trauels, and the better
learned he was: euen so much the more is their fault, that will borrow of him and
not acknowledge it, nor thinke themselues beholding vnto him. For as Plinie
saith, "Ingenui pudoris est, fateri per quos profecerimus;" It is the part of a good
nature not to be ashamed to acknowledge and confesse by whom he is the better,
and benefited. I know it hath beene an old vsage in all ages, and among all the ancient
writers, both Græcians &amp; Latinists, that they would borrow of other mens
writings, and inlarge their owne therewith: as Plato did of Socrates and Pythagoras,
Aristotle out of Plato, Cicero of them both; and so likewise others: and
these men would not onelie confesse the same, which was accounted to be some
part of recompense, but also they accounted their owne dooings to be so much the
better, as that they were confirmed by the authoritie of such wise, graue, and well

learned men. The like reason might suffice to persuade such in this later age, as
which be so curious that they will not haue anie fatther, doctor, or anie other writer
to be named nor alleaged in sermons, readings, prechings, or writings; and yet
they will not sticke to vse &amp; recite verbatim, whole sentences, yea &amp; whole pages
out of other mens writings, and attribute the same to themselues, as of their owne
inuention. A great fault and a point of ingratitude, not allowed among the gentiles:
much lesse should it be so among christians, especiallie among them of the
highest profession, "Non profiteri per quos profecerint."</p>
<p part="N">But leauing euerie man to himselfe, for as much as all histories are to be doone
with all sinceritie &amp; truth, which in this cannot be so well doone, vnlesse the first
writer and author of this historie of Ireland haue his place: I haue thought good
to publish and set foorth Giraldus his owne workes as they are, which, leauing all
other translations, I haue as faithfullie translated as the historie requireth, and in as
fit an English phrase as is most meete and cofiuenient for the reader. And because
the same so long hense written, hath sundrie obscure things, which doo require
some further opening, for the better vnderstanding of the reader; I haue subnected
and added to euerie chapter (so requiring) such notes and obseruations, as he shall
be therewith the better instructed and satisfied. This thing thus by me doone, together
with so much as I my selfe haue penned from the death of king Henrie the
eight vnto these presents: which although it maie seeme to be verie imperfect, and
to want that fulnesse as the course of so manie yeares might affoord; or that some
things maie be misreported and set downe, otherwise than the truth is, or that some
things maie be mistaken, &amp;c: let this be imputed vnto them, through whose default
the same is so befallen; for manie things were promised and little performed;
and some, who had and haue an interest in the matter, haue refused and would doo
nothing. But for my selfe, according to such instructions and collections as are
come to my hands, I haue after the method and nature of an historie, most sincerelie
and faithfullie set downe what is materiall and woorthie the writing. And
for as much as your selfe was a partie and a dooer in some part of the Desmonds
wars, in which you were a painfull and a faithfull seruitor, and therefore can giue
some report and testimonie to this discourse, and also for the loue and honour
which I doo owe and beare vnto you, I thought it my part and dutie to offer and
present, and presentlie in most humble maner I doo offer and present the same
vnto your good fauour and protection. And albeit the thing it selfe be veriè
slender, and too farre an inferior present to be offred to one of your estate and
calling; yet let your courtesie couer that, and accept my good will, which as time
and occasion hereafter shall serue, I shall &amp; will be most willing (as your lordships
most deuout and assured) to supplie in all the good seruices I maie or shall be
able to doo at your commaundement. The Lord blesse you and multiplie your
daies, to the honor of God, the good seruice of hir maiestie, the benefit of the
commonwelth, the comfort of your friends, and to your owne increase in all honour.</p>

Vnto his Historie of the Conquest of Ireland.</head>

<p part="N">FORSOMUCH as in our Topographie we haue at large set foorth and described
the site of the land of Ireland, the natures of sundrie things therein conteined,
the woonderous &amp; strange prodigies which are in the same, and of the first origin
of that nation, euen from the first beginning vntill this our time: it resteth, that
at the request of sundrie men, and of some of great estate, we do now in a particular
volume declare &amp; set forth the conquest of the same land in these our daies,
togither with the noble acts &amp; gests therein doone. For if we haue well discouered
the old &amp; ancient times long before vs, how much more should we doo that
which we haue seene, and for the most part are witnesses thereof, &amp; which are yet
in our fresh &amp; perfect memorie? Our Topographie discouereth the things done
in times past and long ago; but this present historie intreateth of the things presentlie
doone, and in our daies. But me thinketh I see some man to shrinke vp the
nose, and as it were to snuffe, because I haue written all things so plainelie and euidentlie;
and therfore in great scorne he reacheth the booke to one, &amp; with as
great disdaine casteth it to another. But let him know this, that I haue now
written this chieflie for the laie people, and for such princes as be not of greatest
learning, and are therefore desirous to haue things to be vttered in such a plaine and
sensible speech as they may best vnderstand the same. For whie, most plaine terms
are most meet to be vsed, when the noble acts of noble men &amp; worthie seruitors
are to be published and set foorth to the notice and knowledge of all mem. For
this cause therefore haue I written this historie in as plaine &amp; sensible maner as I
can (leauing as much as may be) the darke &amp; obscure maner of writing vsed in
times past. And forsomuch as euerie age hath his peculiar manner, I haue according
to the mind of the philosopher (whose aduise is, that the liues of the old men,
and the pleasant speeches of yoong men should be receiued and followed) I haue
(I saie) of purpose written in that order and phrase of speech as now is most in vreFor
sith that words are but messengers of a mans mind, and giuen onelie to that
end he should without close couering and couching plainelie disclose his mind and
meaning: I haue purposelie indeuored my selfe, that seeing what others doo not
see, and knowing what others doo not vnderstand, I might so write as I might of all
men be vnderstood. For whie, Seneca saith: It is better to be dumbe and not to speake
at all, than so to speake as not to be vnderstood, so that the speech be framed in such
phrases &amp; order as are most meet to be vsed, &amp; with the wise and learned do most
affect. But forsomuch as some men haue maliciouslie and slanderouslie depraued my
Topographie, I haue thought good by the waie here to interlace a few words in defense
therof. All men generallie concerning the beginning of a good or a learned matter,
doo consider and haue respect speciallie to three things; the first is, the author of
the thing, then the matter it selfe, and lastlie, the ordering and well handling of
the thing so begun. Concerning the first and last of these three, the enuious man

being afraid to vtter his malice, euen against his will giues praise &amp; commendation
to both. But yet as a staged man can not alwaies dissemble and cloke himselfe, so
this man, who to haue his will ouer me &amp; to depraue me, inueigheth against the
second point, thinking and meaning by reproouing me to be a lier therein, to condemne
all the rest; he obiecteth therefore and laieth to my charge the strange prodigies
which I wrote, namelie how the woolfe spake and talked with a priest; of
the man that in the hinder parts was like to an ox; of a woman that had a beard
like a man; and a man like an horse; of a gote &amp; a lion, which resorted and accompanied
with a woman. But who so misliketh hereof, let him read in the booke
of Numbers, &amp; he shall find that Balaams asse spake and reprooued his maister.
Let him examine the liues of the fathers, and he shall learne how that a satyre in
the wildernesse did talke with Anthonie the heremite; and how Paule the heremite
was fed in the desert by a rauen. Let him read also the workes of Jerome, the
Exameron of Ambrose, and the dialog of Gregorie. Let him likewise read saint
Augustine his booke of the citie of God, especiallie the xv. and xxi. bookes, which
are full of strange prodigies and woonders: let him read Isodorus in the xi. booke
of his Etymologies, concerning woonders, his xij. booke of beasts, &amp; his xvi.
booke of pretious stones, and of their vertues; let him also read Valerius Maximus,
Trogus Pompeius, Plinius, and Solinus, &amp; in euerie of these he shall find manie
things which he may mislike and thinke to be vntruths, &amp; so condemne the residue
of all the writings of so noble and woorthie men. But let him be better aduised, &amp;
consider well, how that as S. Ierome saith, there are manie things conteined in the
scriptures which seeme to be incredible, and to carie no truth in them, and yet
neuerthelesse are most true. For whie, nature dooth not, nor can preuaile against
the Lord of nature: and therfore euerie creature ought not loth, but to reuerence,
and haue in great admiration the works of God: &amp; as S. August. saith, How can
that be against nature which is doone by the will of God? Bicause the will of so
great a creator is the nature and beginning of euerie thing created. A portent then
or a monster is not against nature, but against it which proceedeth from nature.
And therfore as it is not impossible to God to ordeine and creat what natures or
things he listeth; no more is it impossible to him to alter and change into what
forms he listeth the things alreadie created. And yet I would not that euerie thing
by me written, should foorthwith be credited and receiued as an vndouted truth:
for whie, I my selfe do not so firmlie beleeue of them, as of things most certeine
and true, sauing of such things which by experience I know to be true, and which
also euerie other man may by proofe so find it to be. For as for all other things,
I so account of them, that I neither do nor will stand either in the deniall or affirmation
of them. The iewellers &amp; such as haue, &amp; be acquainted with the pretious
stones come out of India, do not so strangelie think or haue admiration of them, as
they who neuer saw them afore: &amp; yet they hauing had once experience of them,
do the lesse muse &amp; wonder at the strangenes of them. For whie, the dailie vse
taketh awaie all strangenes &amp; admiration; and euerie thing be it neuer so strange
&amp; maruellous at the first, yet by dailie viewing of them they wax to be contemned
and the lesse esteemed: euen as the Indians themselues do litle value or esteeme
their commodities, which we do so much maruell &amp; wonder at. S. Augustine therfore
vpon the gospell, how the water was turned into wine hath these words: Maruellous
great is the power of God in the creation of the heauen &amp; earth, &amp; of the
gouerning of the same; &amp; as great it is to see how the raine water, by the nature
of the vine is turned into wine, and how of litle and small seeds great trees and
fruits do spring and grow; and yet because we do see it this daie as it were by a
naturall course, we do lesse esteeme &amp; consider of them. But yet God aboue the
common course hath reserued to himselfe some small things, &amp; which seeme to be

<!--<fw place="bot-right">"of"</fw>-->


<pb n="113"/>

<!--<fw place="top-center">"THE FIRST PREFACE."</fw>--><!--<fw place="top-right">"113"</fw>-->


of no value, to the end that his power might appeare in greater things, and driue vs
the more to consider of them. Wherefore let the malicious &amp; enuious be contented,
&amp; not to enuie against the Lord of nature, who of purpose in the sight of
man hath doone manie things against the common course of nature: because it
should be apparant, &amp; euerie man should well see, that Gods power far exceedeth
mans reach &amp; knowledge, &amp; his diuinitie surpasseth mans vnderstanding. Cassiodorus
therfore saith: It is a great point of knowledge in man to vnderstand &amp; haue
the knowledge, that God can and dooth such great and woonderfull things as do
far exceed and passe the capacitie &amp; vnderstanding of man. For God alwaies of
purpose dooth transpose and alter his great things into strange forms, that albeit
men may in some respect discerne the same: yet fullie they can not comprehend
the same. If then the old and ancient writers haue diligentlie and with good
allowance noted &amp; registred in their writings the strange prodigies in their times;
whie are we doing the like (vnlesse the whole world be set in wickednesse) maligned
and backbitten? For if there be anie new and strange thing in our worke,
and which heretofore hath not beene heard of: yet let not the malicious &amp; spitefull
man forthwith, without further allowance condemne and depraue it, but rather
suffer to remaine as it is. For as the poet saith: If our forefathers had reiected (as
we do) all new things, what shuld now be old? Let him therfore cease to blame or
carpe at new things, because in course of time they ceasse to be new, and wax to
be old. He may therfore take his pleasure, and depraue the same, &amp; yet no doubt
our posteritie will allow therof. He may do what he can to hurt it, yet they will
accept and read it. He may do what he can to disprooue and blame it, yet will
they loue it. He may do what he can to reiect it, yet will they receiue and allow
of it.

The Second Preface of <persName instant="false" full="yes">Giraldus Cambrensis</persName> Vnto the Noble Earle of Poitiers.
</head>

<p part="N">HAUING beene eftsoones, and by manie requested, to register and write
the historie of such noble acts doone in our times, which I haue either seene
my selfe, or haue heard it crediblie reported; I was for my excuse woont to alleage
the wickednesse of the time, wherem, by reason of the excessiue riotousnesse
which so aboundeth, all things are so farre out of order, and men so carefull to
pamper vp the bodie, that the mind, which of his nature is free, is now in captiuitie,
and cannot haue his libertie. Neuerthelesse, considering, and diligentlie
aduising with my selfe, how necessarie the knowledge of those things will be to
our posteritie, and how nothing is more pernicious and hurtfull to a good wit, and
an honest disposition, than to lie wallowing in idlenesse and sloth; I did at length
with much adoo yeeld my selfe to those requests, and resolued my selfe to satisfie
the same. But yet what can be more presumptuous than to write when time serueth
not, &amp; leisure wanteth? Or to desire our owne bookes to be commonlie read,
and yet at no leisure to read our selues? Or that we should be subiect to the examination
and sifting of a malicious reader, and an enuious iudge, and yet we not
at leisure to examine our selues? Tullius, the founteine and welspring of all eloquence,
being on a time requested to make an oration, is said he did excuse himselfe,
because he had not studied nor read the daie before. If so famous a man,
and the father of all eloquence, did so esteeme the benefit of studieng, what shall
others of a farre meaner estate and learning thinke of themselues? For true it is,
the wit of man if it be not reuiued with continuall and dailie reading waxeth faint
and dull, and with reading it is increased and nourished as it were with a naturall
food and sustenance. For as the full barns are soone spent, if they be not new
stored; and the stocke of great wealth and treasure soone wasted &amp; consumed, if
it be not repared; euen so the knowledge of man being not dailie renewed by reading
and perusing of other mens works dooth soone perish and decaie. We are
compact and doo consist of two natures, the one temporall, the other eternall; and
hauing respect to both, are to norish both, the earthie part with things transitorie
and earthie according to the time, the heauenlie part with things perpetuall and
euerlasting. The bodie for the time hath his cares; but the mind, which of his
nature is free, and which cannot be shut vp, and as it were imprisoned, is neither
vnder the power of vs, nor of anie others; let it therefore inioie his owne and
proper libertie which to it apperteineth, and inioie the freedome to it belonging.
As for the outward man, let him wander and straie, and be troubled about manie
things, let him follow vaine and trifling toies, and doo all things as will lusteth, &amp;
let him be subiect to the miserable condition of the flesh: but the inward man, which
as the kernell is inclosed in the shell, let him inioie that right and priuilege which
God hath giuen vnto it; let it be so warded and defended, that being in troubles,

it be not troubled; and being solitarie, it be not destituted. God and the king
haue ech of them their seuerall power and empire ouer vs: the king hath power
onelie ouer the bodie, but the secret and incomprehensible part within vs, namelie
the soule, God onelie possesseth, and he alone knoweth and searcheth the same.
For it is a most noble and excellent thing, passing all other the gifts of God vnder
heauen, being incomprehensible, and yet comprehending all things, and most
euidentlie declaring the diuine power which is in it. For by a certeine naturall
agilitie which is in him he comprehendeth all the foure corners of the world, and
in a maruellous secret celeritie dooth discerne the whole world and all that therein
is: it hath the knowledge and vnderstanding of all arts, sciences &amp; knowledges:
he is onlie knowen to him that is vnknowen, seene of him that is not seene, &amp;
coŌprehended of him which is incomprehensible. God forbid therefore, that the
continuall exercises of this soule should be hindered with vaine and worldlie cares,
whereby things for a time omitted or set aside should perish or be forgotten: for
what is the bodie to the soule but a heauie burthen, a paine, &amp; as it were a prison,
which though not holding him, yet hindering him? For what the shell is to the
kernell, the same is the flesh to the spirit, both of them carrieng his owne impediment
and burthen. Wherefore right noble now earle of Poitiers, but shortlie
which shall be king of England, &amp; duke of Normandie, hauing the force and helpe
of this, I haue yeelded my selfe, and haue now written and drawen out the historie
of the conquest of Ireland, and the subduing of the barbarous nation of the same
in these our daies, and haue dedicated the same vnto your highnesse: that by recording
the gifts thereof, and seeing how your father did grow in renowme and
honor, so the same also may increase in you: and as you are knowen to be the right
heire of your fathers inheritance, so you may succeed him also in his vertues and
victories to your great honor. I haue hitherto trauelled in this rude and rough
matter after a grosse manner, but hereafter more fullie, and in better order to be
expressed and set foorth, as time and yeares shall increase, and as I shall be more
at full instructed.

To His Host Reuerend Lord And Beloued In Christ,

Iohn

The Noble And Worthie

King Of England, Lord Of Ireland,

Duke Of Normandie And Of Aquitaine.
And Earle Of Aniou:

Giraldus Offereth This His Simple Worke, And Wisheth All Health Both
Of Bodie And Of Soule, And A Prosperous Successe In All
Things According To His Hearts Desire.
</salute>

<p part="N">IT pleased your noble and excellent father king Henrie, to send me being then
attendant vpon him, ouer with you into Ireland, where when I had noted sundrie
notable things, and which were strange and vnknowne to other nations: then
at my returne, I made a collection and choise of the chiefest matters therein: and
within three yeares, I made my booke of Topographie, of the woonders of Ireland,
and of the description of that land, doone in and for the honor of your father;
who hauing good liking, and being well pleased with those my trauels (for why,
he was a prince (a thing rare in our times) verie well learned) his desire and pleasure
was, I should also write out the historie of the last conquest of the same land,
made by him and his. Which renewing my former trauels I did: but neither it,
nor these my paines were considered. For vertue commonlie is more commended
than rewarded. But because by negligence, or rather by reason of the great businesse,
wherewith I was incumbred: I had almost forgotten the site, nature, and
maner of the west parts of the said land, which I had not seene a long time. I
thought it good to ouerrun, and peruse againe my said worke, and being better
corrected, to dedicat the same vnto your highnesse. Wherein our historie taketh
his beginning from the time that Dermon mac Morogh prince of Leinster was driuen
out of his countrie by his owne men, and fled to your father then being in Aquitane:
most humblie crauing, and at length obteining aid and succor, vntill your
first comming into that land, when I was with you: and haue faithfullie declared in
order, what things were there doone by euerie of these noble men and capteins,
which then passed thither; euen from the first to the last; and what good or euill
was doone by them.</p>

<p part="N">In which historie as in a glasse, a man may most apparantlie and euidentlie see
and discerne truth; who, and what they were which deserued the most honor in
this conquest; whether the first aduenturers out of the diocesse of saint Dauids
my cousins and kinsmen; or they of the diocesse of Landaff, who came next, and
who in verie deed are gentlemen, but more in name than valiant in act; and who
vpon the good successe of the first, hoping to haue the like themselues, went ouer:
or else they which passed ouer the third time, who were well and fullie furnished
at all points with good store of armor, vittell, and other necessaries. Surelie they
deserued well, who gaue the first aduenture: and they also are much to be commended,
which continued the same: but they deserued best, who went ouer last.
For they not onelie did establish and confirme the authoritie and dooings of the
first and second, but also made a finall end, and brought the whole countrie into
subiection. But alas, by reason of their too hastie returning from thense, and of
the vnnaturall warres and rebellion of the sonnes against their father, the land
could not be brought to a perfect order, nor the things begun could haue his full
perfection. Wherefore, ô noble king, despise not the great trauels and labors of
your father, nor yet my poore paines herein. Doo not impart your honor and
glorie to the vnworthie and vnthankefull: neither for the coueting of an Iland of
siluer to hazard the losse of one of gold: the one far passing and exceeding the
other in value. For the gold of Arabia and the siluer of Achaia doo both fill a mans
cofer alike: but the one more in price and value than the other. Besides this,
there is another thing which might persuade you to be mindfull, and haue some regard
of the land of Ireland. It hath pleased God and good fortune to send you
manie children, both naturall, and also legitimat; and more hereafter you may
haue. It were therefore verie good as you may, to appoint and place in those two
kingdomes, two of your sonnes to be gouernors and rulers of them: and vnder
them to appoint a great number of your men, and endow them liberallie with great
liuings and liuelehoods; and especiallie in Ireland, which as yet is rude, vnnurtured,
and nothing to the purpose by our men inhabited. But if so be that neither
for the increasing of your owne honor, the inriching of your treasurie, nor for the
aduancing of your children, you will haue respect to your realme of Ireland; yet
haue some consideration of your poore veterans and old seruitors, who haue most
faithfullie and trustilie serued both you and your father, and by whose seruice that
realme of Ireland was first conquered; and is yet kept and reteined; and yet are
supplanted by such yoong nouices and yoonkers as are of late gone thither, to
inioy and to succeed into the fruits of other mens tranels, fortune better fauouring
them, than vertue commending. And the follie of these men is growne to such a
pride and arrogancie, that as it is said, they are greatlie to be suspected to aspire
and to vsurpe the whole seigniorie and dominion to themselues, which it lieth you
vpon to see to be quailed and abated.</p>
<p part="N">And in following these your Irish affaires, you are to haue great care and regard,
that when so euer you doo march and take anie iourneie, either for the vanquishing
of the enimie, or for the reuenging of anie wrongs and iniuries; that you haue
alwaies an eie backeward, and leaue all things behind you in such safe and sure
order, that no danger thereof doo insue vnto you. For why, the houshold enimies
be alwaies working of wiles, and waiting for an aduantage; and doo but looke when
time and place may serue for them to rebell: and therefore you are to haue great
care and good regard, that you doo leaue all things behind you in safetie, and out
of danger: and that you doo not suffer the serpent to lurke and hide himselfe, as it

were in your bosome: nor to nourish and rake vp the fire as it were in your lap, the
same being readie to breake out into great flames: for this shall not onelie be counted
a great retchlesnesse, but also a great follie in you, and to your great reproch.
It is verie expedient therefore to euerie prince, that in his land he doo not foster
and mainteine anie such Hydras and venemous serpents. And for princes of Ilands,
it should be good for them, that they in their dominions and realmes haue in no
side anie other marches than the seas it selfe. But if it be so, that you will not be
persuaded for anie of the foresaid reasons, to haue regard or remorse to your said
land, being so oftentimes desolated, and almost vtterlie destroied; that it may be
reduced to some better order and state, whereby it may be more profitable to your
selfe and vnto yours: then I praie you to pardon vs Welshmen, notwithstanding
we be of nature somewhat rash; and giue vs leaue to put you in remembrance
touching which your father, for the aduancement of himselfe and of his posteritie,
did promise to pope Adrian, when he first procured licence and libertie to inuade
and to conquer the realme of Ireland. The first is, that you would set vp the true
religion, and reforme the church of God in that realme: and then, as you doo now
in England, so also in Ireland, you doo cause to be paied out of euerie house the
Peter pence, according to the tenure of the said priuilege by your father obteined,
and which remaineth in the treasurie of Winchester; that you maie so deliuer your
fathers soule, and satisfie his promise. For why, as Salomon saith: A lieng toong
beseemeth not a king, especiallie when he shall liue to God, and being a creature,
wittinglie to offend his creator; for that is an offense verie heinous and dangerous.</p>
<p part="N">And forsomuch as you are to answer before the high and strict iudge, hauing
nothing for your excuse and defense than as before is said, for the so much innocent
bloud by your father and your selfe alredie shed, and which hereafter maie be
shed: you ought to be verie carefull and diligent, that Gods anger maie be appeased,
and your fathers promise be performed: that God being thus honored for this conquest,
you maie haue a prosperous successe, and all yours in this world: and also
after this life inioie that perpetuall felicitie, which surpasseth all ioie and felicitie.
And because you haue not kept nor performed these promises, these two defects
by Gods iust iudgement are fallen vnto you. The one is, that this conquest could
neuer be brought to his full effect and perfection. The other is, that they which
were the cheefest and most principall seruitors in this conquest, namelie Robert
Fitzstephans, who first entered into the land, and made waie vnto others, Henrie
of monte Moris, Reimond, Iohn de Courcie, and Meilerius, neuer had anie lawfull
issue of their bodies begotten. And no maruell: for notwithstanding the
happie and fortunat successe of the conquest, the poore cleargie was neuer considered,
but were driuen to beg; and the cathedrall churches which were richlie
indued with great liuelehoods, possessions, and territories, were altogither wasted
and spoiled. These things a good prince of his honor ought to see to be redressed,
and to prouide that the cleargie, who are and ought faithfullie to assist and serue
him in all weightie causes of councell and importance, should be releeued, and
inioie the honor vnto them belonging, and that small portion which was promised
vnto them; that God in some things maie be appeased and satisfied for these cruell
and bloudie conquests. And moreouer, vnder your patience we saie also, that for
the perpetuall memorie of this conquest made by Englishmen, and because in processe
of time, and course of yeares, there happeneth great change of lords, and
manie times the inheritance commeth to such as are furthest remoued in kinred,
that therefore there be a yearelie tribute rated and yeelded vnto the king, to be

paied in gold or such commodities as that land best yeeldeth: and that this be comprised
in a publike instrument, that the whole world maie know how the realme
and land of Ireland is subiect to the crowne of England. And forsomuch as
things doone, being put and registred in writing, and to be read by an interpretor,
are not sensible, nor so well vnderstanded of the hearer, as when he maie or dooth
read the same in his owne speech and language; it were verie good (in my opinion)
that some learned man, and skilfull in the French toong, should translate the same
into French.</p>

<head>How Dermon Mac Morogh king of Leinster fled out of his countrie vnto Henrie the second king of England for aid and succour.</head>
<head>CHAP. 1.</head>

<p part="N">DERMON (1) Mac Morogh prince of (2) Leinster &amp; gouernour of the fift
part or portion of Ireland, did in our time possesse &amp; inioie the east part of
the land, which bordereth and lieth towards England: being disseuered from the
same by the maine seas. This man from his verie youth, and first entrie into his
kingdome, was a great oppressor of his gentlemen, and a cruell tyrant ouer his
nobles: which bred vnto him great hatred and malice. Besides this, there befell
to him an other mischéefe: for Ororike prince of (3) Meth was gone in a iornie,
leauing his wife the daughter of Omolaghlin behind, in a certeine Iland in Meth:
there to remaine and tarie vntill his returne. She (I saie) and this Dermon had
béene long inamoured and in loue the one with the other: and she watching a
time how to haue loue and lust satisfied, taketh the aduantage of hir husbands absence,
and yéeldeth hir selfe to be rauished, bicause she would be rauished: for by
hir owne procurement and intisings, she became and would needs be a preie vnto
the preier. Such is the variable &amp; fickle nature of a woman, by whome all mischiefes
in the world (for the most part) doo happen and come, as maie appeare by
(4) Marcus Antonius, and by the destruction of (5) Troie. King Ororike being
aduertised hereof, was foorthwith maruellouslie troubled &amp; in a great choler, but
more grieued for shame of the fact than for sorrow or hurt; and therefore is fullie
determined to be auenged: and foorthwith assembleth all his people and neighbors,
as also procured into his aid and for his helpe Rothorike king of (6) Connagh and
then monarch of all Ireland. The people of Leinster considering in what distresse
their prince was, and how on euerie side he was beset of his enimies, they also call
to mind the old sores and griefes, which they of long time had dissembled: &amp; to
be auenged &amp; awrecked thereof, they make league and become friends with their
enimies, and vtterlie leaue and forsake their king. Dermon séeing himselfe thus

forsaken and left destitute, and that fortune frowned vpon him (for he had oftentimes
incountered with his enimies and euer had the woorst) determined at length,
as to his last refuge to flie ouer the seas, and to séeke for some better chance. By
this euent and sequele of this man, as also by manie other like examples it appeareth,
that it is better for a prince to rule ouer a people, which of a good will and loue
doo obeie him, than ouer such as be froward and stubborne. This (6) Nero well
felt and (7) Domitianus well knew (8) and Henrie duke of Saxonie and Bauire
well tried. It is more necessarie and expedient for a prince to be rather beloued
than feared. In deed it is good to be feared; so that the feare doo procéed rather
from a good will than of compulsion. For whatsoeuer is outwardlie onelie and to
the shew loued and receiued, the same of consequence must be feared: but whatsoeuer
is feared, that is not forthwith loued. Wherefore feare must be so tempered
with loue, that neither a remisse good will doo wax into a coldnesse, neither
feare grounded vpon a rash insolencie be turned and become tyrannie. Loue did
inlarge the empire of (9) Augustus, but feare shortened the life of (10) Iulius
Cesar. Well, Mac Morogh following fortune, and yet in hope that once againe
she will turne hir whéele, hauing wind and wether at will, taketh ship, passeth
ouer the seas, and went vnto Henrie the second king of England, and most humblie
and earnestlie praieth his helpe and succor. Who being then in the remote
places in France and Aquitaine, and busied in great and weightie affaires: yet most
courteouslie he receiued him and liberallie rewarded him. And the king hauing at
large and orderlie heard the causes of his exile and of his repaire vnto him, he tooke
his oth of allegiance and swore him to be his true vassall and subiect: and therevpon
granted and gaue him his letters patents in maner and forme as followeth.
Henrie king of England, duke of Normandie and Aquitaine, and earle of Aniou,

vnto all his subiects, Englishmen, Normans, Scots, and all other nations and people
being his subiects sendeth greeting. Whensoeuer these our letters shall come
vnto you, know ye that we haue receiued Dermon prince of Leinster into our protection,
grace, and fauour: wherefore whosoeuer within our iurisdiction will aid
and helpe him, our trustie subiect, for the recouerie of his land, let him be assured
of our fauour and licence in that behalfe.</p>
<p part="N">(1) Dermon is in Latine <emph>Dermitius,</emph> and Morogh is in Latine <emph>Murchardes,</emph> and
are méere Irish names: and for a difference giuen commonlie to a child at his birth
or christening: Mac Morogh is a word compounded of Mac which is a sonne and
of Morogh the proper name of a man, and so Mac Morogh is the sonne of Morogh:
the Latine name is <emph>Murchardides,</emph> which is to saie <emph>De Murcharde,</emph> or of Morogh:
according to the Welsh phrase in which the word ap is vsed in the same sense. And
this is common to the Irish &amp; Welsh, for they call not anie man by the name of
his familie or nation as is vsed in England: but by the name of difference giuen
to his father, as in this example: Dermon being Moroghs sonne is called Dermon
Mac Morogh. But this name of Mac Morogh is since turned and become the name
of a familie or nation: for by reason that this Mac Morogh was a noble and valiant
man aboue all the rest of his nation in his daies: therefore his sequele and posteritie
haue euer since and doo yet kéepe that name. Some are of the mind that Morogh
and Maurice are one name: but the Latine differences importeth the contrarie, and
the one is a meere Irish name, and the other a Welsh, and borowed out of Wales.</p>
<p part="N">(2) Leinster in Latine <emph>Lagenia,</emph> is one of the fiue parts or portions of Ireland
(for into so manie is the whole land diuided.) It lieth vpon the east seas, and
extendeth in length from the further point of the territorie of Dublin, which
is at the riuer of the Boine by Drogheda in the north, vnto the riuer of the Surie
which fléeteth by the citie of Waterford in the south. In it are one and thirtie

cantreds otherwise named baronies or hundreds. It was sometimes diuided into
fiue, but now into seauen counties, that is, Dublin, Kildare, Catherlogh, Kils
kennie, Wexford, Leax, now called the queenes countie, and Offalie called the
kings countie. There are also in it one archbishop; namelie Dublin, and foure
bishopriks; that is, Kildare, Fernes, Leighlin, and Ossorie.</p>
<p part="N">(3) Meth in Latine <emph>Media</emph> is one of the fiue portions of Ireland according to the
first diuision. It is the least portion being but of eightéene cantreds, but yet the
best and most fertile, and lieth for the most part all within the English pale: and
euer since the conquest of king Henrie the second, hath béene subiect and obedient
to the English lawes and gouernement: and bicause it lieth as it were in the nauill
or bowels of the land, it taketh the name accordinglie, being called <emph>Media,</emph> which
is the middle. In it is but one bishop and the suffragan, and under the primat or
archbishop of Ardmach. His see is at Trim and his house at Arbraghin. There
was no prince sole gouernour of this as was of the other portions: bicause it was
alwaies allowed &amp; allotted to the monarch, whome they called <emph>Maximum regem,</emph> or
<emph>Regem Hiberniœ,</emph> as a surplus towards his diet.</p>
<p part="N">(4) Marcus Antonius was a famous and a noble Romane, excelling in wisdome,
knowledge and learning all the Romane princes in his daies; as also a verie noble
and a valiant man in the fields, hauing atteined to great victories and atchiued to
sundrie conquests. And yet notwithstanding being maried to Cleopatra queene of
Egypt, he so doted vpon hir, and was so bewitched in loue of hir: that leauing all
his woonted manners, he consumed his whole time in hir companie, and in the end
was more infamous for his vitious, disordered, and loose life, than before commended
for his prowesse and vertue.</p>
<p part="N">(5) Troia called also Ilion, was an ancient and a famous citie in Asia the lesse,
and situated in the prouince of Dardania, builded by Tros the sonne of king Ericthonius,
who called it after his owne name. It was a citie verie large, strong, and
rich, and in those daies thought impregnable; &amp; yet by means that Helena was
rauished, the same was in the end vtterlie subuerted and destroied: the historie is
this. Priamus the king of Troie had by his wife Hecuba a sonne named Paris or
Alexander: he dreamed on a time that Mercurius should bring vnto him the thrée
ladies, Venus, Iuno, and Minerua, that he should giue his iudgement which was
the fairest and most beautifull of them. Then Venus, to haue the iudgement for
hir and in hir behalfe, did promise him that he should haue for the same the fairest
woman in all Gréece. Not long after, Paris being in his fathers court in Troie,
there were great spéeches made of Helena and of hir passing beautie. She was wife
to Menelaus king of Sparta in Gréece. Whervpon Paris calling to memorie his
former dreame, and also inflamed with a feruent desire to see so faire a ladie, maketh
preparation both of ships and of men to saile into Greece. Howbeit, some write
that he was sent by the king his father in an ambassage to king Menelaus: but
whether it was so or not, certeine it is he went thither, and was receiued with all
countesie, and had his interteinement in king Menelaus house. Paris hauing viewed
and beholden quéene Helena, he was not so much warmed before vpon the onelie
report of hir, as now inflamed with hir passing forme and beautie; and taking the
aduantage of king Menelaus absence, perforce taketh Helena, spoileth the kings
house, and carieth all awaie with him. Menelaus at his returne home, being dismaied
at so sudden a change and chance, and gréened with such an iniurie, sendeth
his messenger first to Paris, and then his ambassadours to king Priamus for it stitution
and amends. But when no intreatie could take place nor requests be heard,
the Grecians not minding to beare with such an iniurie, doo all consent to be

but in the end Troie was taken, spoiled, and also destroied.</p>
<p part="N">(6) Nero, whose name at the first was Claudius Domitius, was in his youthfull
yeares well disposed to good letters, &amp; giuen to honest exercises. And Claudius
the emperor hauing good liking of him, adopted him to be emperour, and married
him vnto his daughter. After the death of Claudius, he being emperour, did gouerne
well enough the first fiue yeares: but thensefoorth he waxed so vicious, and
became so horrible in all dissolute wantonnesse, prodigalitie, monstruous lecherie,
couetousnesse, and all other most wicked vices: that he séemed to be borne to the
destruction of the whole world. And in the end he was and became so odious to
the whole world, that it was decréed by the senat, and sentence giuen, that he
should be beaten and whipped to death. Which thing he perceiuing, fled out of
Rome, and finding none that would kill him, did runne himselfe thorough with his
owne sword, saieng; "Most wickedlie haue I liued, and most shamfullie shall
I die."</p>
<p part="N">(7) Domitianus, the brother of Titus, and sonne of Vespasian the emperors, was
nothing like vnto them, but altogither resembled &amp; was of the nature and disposition
of Nero: for at the first entrie into the empire, he did to his commendation
sundrie good acts; but in the end he became so wicked a man and so crueil a tyrant,
that he generallie was hated of all men, and abhorred of his owne familie,
of whom some of them, to rid the common wealth from so wicked a member, did
murther and kill him in his owne chamber.</p>
<p part="N">(8) This Henrie was the sonne of Henrie the third of that name, and emperor
of Rome, he was king of the Romans in his fathers time, and emperor next after
him. His father died, he being verie yoong, and left him to the gouernement of
the empresse his mother; who during his minoritie did rule and gouerne the empire
in verie good order: but when he himselfe came to the sole gouernment, great dissentions
fell betwéene him and his nobles, bicause he contemned, despised, &amp; oppressed
them. He gaue himselfe to wantonnesse and pleasure, and little estéemed
the execution of iustice; by means whereof he had manie enimies, who sought
what they might to depose him both of empire and of his life. The pope also and
he were for the most part in continuall debates and strifes, and who was the chéefe
cause whie he was so ouerset and hated of his nobles. And being thus ouermatched
and in the hatred both of the temporall and ecclesiasticall estates, he for verie sorrow
languished and pined awaie, and so died.</p>
<p part="N">(9) Augustus was the sonne of Octauianus a senator in Rome, who married
Accia the daughter of Iulius Cesar, and was first named Octauianus Iulius Cesar.
His vncle hauing no son, adopted him, made him his heire, and appointed him to
be his successor in the empire. After the death of the said Iulius, the state by
reason he was so cruellie murthered, was maruelouslie troubled and in great perils.
But this Octauianus hauing atteined to sit in Iulius Cesars seat, did so prudentlie
order and direct his gouernement, that he did not onelie reduce and restore the eitie
and empire of Rome to a quietnesse; but also increased the same with the conquests
of sundrie nations. Such also were his excellent vertues in wisedome, magnanimitie,
courtesie, affabilitie, &amp; liberalitie, and such others; that all people were not onelie rauished
in loue with him, but also came and resorted of all nations vnto Rome, to
visit, see, and heare him. And hauing stablished the empire in quietnesse, inlarged
it with manie nations, &amp; increased vnto himselfe the vniuersall loue of all
people, the senat gaue him not onelie the name of Augustus, but gaue vnto him
also the titles of the highest and greatest honors, and was called "Summus pontifix
perpetuus dictator &amp; pater patriæ," and yéelded vnto him the whole power and
empire of the sole monarch of the world, now reposing that in him alone,

a prudent magistrat and a wise gouernour ruleth in loue and gouerneth in wisedome.</p>

Iulius Cesar was the sonne of Lucius Iulino a noble Romane, and came
and descended of the ancient house of the Iulies, who were of the race of Aeneas:
he was as noble a man as euer Rome brought fourth, and excellent in all respects:
most valiant and fortunate in the warres, and verie prudent in the cinill gouernement,
verie well learned, and a notable orator: he deserued well of his common
wealth, for he inriched the same with the conquests which he made ouer sundrie
nations. But his ambitious mind and immoderate desire to reigne alone, and to be
the sole monarch of the world, drowned all the good vertues which were in him,
and for which all the nations feared him, the citizens of Rome hated him, and the
senators enuied him: and in the end a conspiracie was made for the murthering
of him, and by the senators executed. For he on a certeine daie, vpon occasion
being come into the senat house, and mistrusting nothing, although he wanted not
sufficient warnings before giuen him, was there wounded in two and thirtie places
to death, and so murthered.</p>

<p part="N">DERMON Mac Morogh, hauing receiued great comfort and courtesie of the

had béene verie honourablie and liberallie rewarded of the king: yet he comforted
himselfe more with the hope of good successe to come, than with liberalitie receiued.
And by his dailie iornieng he came at length vnto the noble towne of
(1) Bristow, where bicause ships and botes did dailie repaire and come from out of
Ireland, and he verie desirous to heare of the state of his people and countrie, did
for a time soiorne and make his abode: and whilest he was there he would oftentimes
cause the kings letters to be openlie red, and did then offer great interteinment,
and promised liberall wages to all such as would helpe or serue him; but it
serued not. At length Gilbert the sonne of Gilbert, earle of Chepstone (2) came
to sée him and to talke with him: and they so long had conferred togither, that
it was agréed and concluded betwéene them, that the erle in the next spring then

should giue him his onelie daughter and heire to wife, togither with his whole inheritance,

vnder Rice had the gouernement, &amp; was constable of Abertefie the cheefe towne
in Caretica (4) and by the treacherie and treason of his owne men was apprehended,
taken and deliuered vnto Rice, and by him was kept in prison thrée yeares, but
now deliuered, vpon condition he should take part and ioine with Griffith against
the king. But Robert Fitzstephans, considering with himselfe that on his tathers
side (who was a Norman) he was the kings naturall subiect, although by his mother
the ladie Nesta, daughter to the great Rice Fitzgriffith, he were coosen germane
to the said Fitzgriffith, chose rather to aduenture his life, and to séeke fortune
abrode and in forren countries, than to hazard his faith, credit, and fame, to
the slander, reproch, and infamie of himselfe, and of his posteritie. At length by
the earnest mediation and intercession of Dauid then bishop of S. Dauids, and of
Maurice Fitzgerald, which were his halfe brothers by the mothers side, he was set
frée and at libertie: and then it was agréed and concluded betwéene them and Mac
Morogh, that he the said Mac Morogh should giue and grant vnto the said Robert
Fitzstephans, and Maurice Fitzgerald, the towne of (5) Wexford, with two (6) cantreds
of land adioining, &amp; to their heires in fée for euer: and they in consideration
thereof, promised to aid and helpe him to recouer his lands the next spring then
following: and to be then with him without all faile if wind and weather so serued.
Dermon being wearie of his exiled life and distressed estate, and therfore the more
desirous to draw homewards for the recouerie of his owne, and for which he had
so long trauelled and sought abroad: he first went to the church of S. Dauids to
make his orisons and praiers, and then the wether being faire, and wind good, he
aduentureth the seas about the middle of August; and hauing a merrie passage,
he shortlie landed in his ingratefull (7) countrie: and with a verie impatient mind,
hazarded himselfe among and through the middle of his enimies; and comming
safelie to (8) Fernes, he was verie honorablie receiued of the cleargie there: who
after their abilitie did refresh and succour him: but he for a time dissembling his

and standeth vpon the riuer Hauinum which is nauigable, &amp; fléeteth into
Seuerne or the Seuerne seas: in it there are two rodes, the one named Kingrode,
fiue miles distant from Bristow, in which the ships doo ride. The other is named
Hongrode, a place where the ships lie bedded, and this is thrée miles from Bristow,
It standeth vpon the borders or confines of the prouince of Glocestershire and
Summersetshire: some would haue it to be in the marches and vnder the principalitie,
but in the old times is was parcell of the valleie of Bath, which was the
metropole of Summersetshire. It is verie old, ancient and honorable, and sometimes
named but a towne: but since for desert and other good considerations, honoured
with the name and title of a citie, as also is made a seuerall prouince or countie
of it selfe, being distinct from all others; hauing a maior and aldermen according
to the ancient times, as also two shiriffes according to the latter grants, by whome
the same is directed and gouerned. It is the chéefest emporium in that part of
England, the inhabitants being for the most part merchants of great wealth, aduentures,
and traflikes with all nations: great delings they haue with the Camber
people and the Irish nation, the one of them fast bordering vpon them, and the
other by reason of the néerenesse of the seas, and pleasantnesse of the riuer, dailie

reacheth furthest into the seas towards Ireland: and the same being a verie high
hill, a man shall the more easilie discerne in a faire daie the countrie of Wexford:
for that is the neerest part of Ireland vnto that part of Wales. Not farre from this
promontorie or point is the cathedrail church of saint Dauids, which is the sée of
the bishop there: it was and is called Meneuia, and was in times past an archbishoprike.
But as it is written in the annales of the said church, that in the time
of Richard Carew and two of his predecessors bishops there, they were by the kings
commandement made to yeeld, and submit themselues vnto the metropolitane sée
of Canturburie.</p>

now Cardiganshire, so Aberteife is Cardigan towne, and Caretica Cardiganshire.</p>

<p part="N">(6) A cantred (as Giraldus saith) is a word compounded of the British and of
the Irish toongs, and conteineth so much ground as wherein are one hundred villages:
which in England is termed a hundred. Men of later time to declare the

eight plough lands. Other saie that a cantred conteineth twentie townes,
and euerie towne hath eight plough lands arable, besides sufficient pasture in euerie

knight biparted should first enter with force in arms &amp; breake the bounds of Ireland.
If you will understand the mysterie herof, you must haue respect to his
parents, for his father was a Norman and an Englishman, his mother the noble
ladie Nesta was a Camber or a Britaine, in his companie also was Herueie of Mont
Maurice, a man infortunat, vnarmed, and without all furniture: but he trauelling
in the behalfe of the earle Richard, to whome he was vncle, was rather a (3) spie
than a souldier. On the next daie following Maurice of Prendelgast a (4) iustie
and a hardie man, and borne about Milford in west Wales, he with ten gentlemen
of seruice, and a good number of archers imbarke themselues in two ships, and atriue
also at the Banne. These men thus landed at the Banne, and not standing
well assured of their safetie, by reason their comming was blowen abroad through
the whole countrie, they with all hast sent messengers to Dermon, aduertising him
of their comming. Wherevpon diuerse of that countrie, who dwelling vpon the
sea coasts, and who when fortune frowned had and did shrinke awaie from Dermon,
now perceiuing that she fauored him againe, returned and fawned vpon him; according
to the saieng of the poet in these words:


<quote rend="block"><l part="N">"As fortune so the faith of man doth stand or fall."</l></quote></p>

<p part="N">Mac Morogh, assoone as he heard of their landing and comming, sent his base
son Donold, a valiant gentleman vnto them with fiue hundred men: and verie
shortlie after he himselfe also followed with great ioie and gladnesse. And then
when they had renewed their former couenants and leagues, and had sworne each
one to the other, to obserue the same and to kéepe faith: then, though they were
people of contrarie dispositions, yet now being good fréends and all of one mind,
they ioine their forces togither, and with one consent doo march towards the towne
of Wexford, which is about tweiue miles distant from the Banne. When they of
the towne heard therof, they being a fierce and vnrulie people, but yet much trusting
to their woonted fortune, came foorth about two thousand of them, and were
determined to wage and giue battell. But when they saw their aduersaries armie
to be better set in order than in times past, and that the horssemen were well
armed with armour and shield shining bright: then vpon new chances &amp; changes
taking new counsels, they set on fire and burned their suburbs, and retired into the
towne.</p>
<p part="N">Fitzstephans minding and preparing to giue the assault, filleth the ditches with
armed men, and setteth his archers to marke and watch well the turrets of the wals:
which things doone, he with great showtes and force giueth the assault. The
townesmen within being readie to stand at defense, cast ouer the wals great peeces
of timber &amp; stones, and by that meanes hurting manie, made the rest to giue ouer
and retire. Among whom a lustie yoong gentleman named Robert Barrie, being
hot and of a lustie courage, and nothing afraid of death, so he might atchiue vnto
honour, gineth the first aduenture to scale the wals: but he was striken with a
great stone vpon the headpeece, wherwith he fell headlong downe into the ditch
and escaped verie hardlie, for with much adoo did his fellowes draw &amp; pull him out
of the place. About sixteene yeares after, all his great teeth with the force and
violence of this stroke fell out; and that which is verie strange, new téeth grew vp
in their places. Vpon this repulse they all retired and withdrew themselues from
the wals, &amp; assembled themselues vpon the sea strands, where foorthwith they set
on fire all such ships and vessels as they could there find. Among whome was one
merchant ship latelie come out of England laden with wines and corne, which there
laie then at anchor, and a companie of these lustie youths hauing gotten botes for

lost all and marred the market: for if others their fellowes had not made good shift
and rowed a good pace after them they would scarselie haue recouered the land
againe. Thus fortune, which is onlie constant in inconstancie, séemed to haue
forsaken Morogh and Fitzstephans, and to haue left them destitute of all hope and
comfort: neuerthelesse, on the next morow hauing heard diuine seruice through
the whole campe, they determine with better aduise and circumspection to giue a
new assault, &amp; with lustie courages drew to the wals. The townesmen within séeing
this, began to distrust themselues, &amp; to consider how most vnnaturallie and
vniustlie they had rebelled against their prince &amp; souereigne: whervpon being
better aduised, they send messengers to him to intreat for peace. At length by the
earnest intercession and mediation of two bishops, and certeine good and peaceable
men which were within the towne, peace was granted; and foure of the best &amp;
chiefest men within the towne were deliuered and giuen for pledges and hostages,
for the true kéeping of the peace and their fidelitie. Mac Morogh, to gratifie his
men in these his first successes, and to acquit the first aduenturors, did (according
to his former promise and couenant) giue vnto Robert Fitzstephans and Maurice
Fitzgerald the towne of Wexford, and the territories therevnto adioining and apperteining,
and vnto Herueie of Mont Morice he gaue in fee two cantreds, lieng on
the sea side betwéene Wexford and Waterford.</p>
<p part="N">(1) The Banne is a little créeke lieng in the countie of Wexford, neere to Fither
a fisher towne, which is belonging to the bishop of that diocesse, the open seas being
on the east and not farre from the hauen mouth of Waterford on the south: and
as it should séeme, Fitzstephans and his companie mistooke the place or were
driuen in there, the same being verie vnapt for a harborow: but the same being
the place of the first receipt of Englishmen, there were certeine monuments made
in memorie thereof, and were named the Banna &amp; the Boenne, which were the
names (as the common fame is) of the two greatest ships in which the Englishmen
there arriued.</p>
<p part="N">(2) A knight biparted. The prophesie was not onelie verified in respect of the
parents of Robert Fitzstephans, the one being a Norman Saxon, and the other a
Camber: but also in respect of his armes and ensigne which were biparted being of
two sundrie changes, namelie partie per pale gules, and ermine a saltier counterchanged.
For commonlie all prophesies haue their aliusions vnto armes, and by
them they are discouered, though at the first not so appearing before the euent
thereof.</p>
<p part="N">(3) Gentlemen. The Latine word is <emph>Milites,</emph> which in the now common spéeches
is termed knights, a name of worship and honour: but the word it selfe importeth
and meaneth men expert and skilfull to serue in the wars, whether it be on foot or
horssebacke. In times past when men ruled by the sword, then such as were
valiant and of good experience grew into credit and estimation; and the people did
make choise of such to gouerne, rule, and defend them, and who for their excellent
vertues were called <emph>Nobiles,</emph> which in English is gentlemen. And then men being
ambitious of honour, did contend who might best excell in feats of prowesse and
chiualrie: some deliting to excell in the seruice on foot: and bicause they vsed
chieflie the target and shield, they tooke their name thereof, &amp; were called <emph>Scutiferi.</emph>
Some practised chieflie the seruice on horssebacke, and they (according to
the manner of their seruice) were named <emph>Equites:</emph> but both the one and the other
were in processe of time called <emph>Armigeri,</emph> in English esquiers: and this is taken for
a degrée somewhat aboue the estate of a onelie gentleman. And for somuch
as seruice in the fields did carie awaie with it the greatest honor and credit, and
princes willing &amp; desirous to incourage gentlemen to excell that waie and in that

kind of seruice, they deuised a third degree of honour named knighthood. And
this as it excelleth the others before and not to be giuen but for great desert: so
to increase the credit and estimation thereof, it was not to be giuen but with great
so emnities and ceremonies; and the person so to be honored, was to be adorned
with such ornaments as doo speciallie apperteine to the furniture of such seruice,
as namelie a sword, a target, a helme, a paire of spurres, and such like: and they
which were thus aduanced were named <emph>Milites</emph> or knights, and thus the name of
seruice was turned to the name of worship: yea this degree did grow and wax to
be of such credit, honor and estimation, that kings and princes were and would be
verie circumspect and aduised, before they would dub or promote auie man to this
estate. Wherefore considering the estate, nature &amp; worship of a knight, and weieng
also the course of this historie, it cannot be intended that all they which went ouer
and serued in this conquest, though they were named <emph>Milites,</emph> that therfore they
should be compted &amp; taken for knights of worship and high calling: but that they
were such as were expert and skilfull to serue in warres according to the nature of
the word <emph>Miles.</emph> Wherefore I haue and doo English the word <emph>Miles</emph> in this historie
a gentleman of seruice.</p>

fiercelie the onset vpon them, and slue a great number of them; and such as straied
and were scattered abrode, they either slue them or ouerthrew them: and such as
were ouerthrowne, the footmen with their Galloglasses axes did cut off their heads.
And thus hauing gotten the victorie, they gathered vp and brought before Dermon
Mac Morogh three hundred of their enimies heads, which they laid &amp; put at his
féet; who turning suerie of them one by one to know them, did then for ioy hold
vp both his hands, and with a lowd voice thanked God most highlie. Among
these there was the head of one, whom especiallie and aboue all the rest he mortallie
hated. And he taking vp that by the heare and eares, with his teeth most horriblie
and cruellie bit awaie his nose and lips.</p>
<p part="N">After this, they made a rode through the whole countrie, &amp; marched almost to
the vttermost parts, and still as they passed they murthered the people, spoiled,
burned, and wasted the whole countrie. And therevpon the prince of Ossorie by
the aduise of his friends, maketh sute and intreateth for peace: which obteined (aithough
in verie déed it was but a coloured and a dissembled peace on both sides)
they put in their hostages, made fealtie, and were sworne to bee faithfull and true
to Mac Morogh, as vnto their lawfull and true lord. In these seruices, as in all
other, Robert of Barrie, and Meilerius had the pricke and praise, and shewed themselues
of all others the most valiant. Both these yoong gentlemen were nephues
to Fitzstephans (4) the one being his brothers sonne, and the other his sisters
sonne. They both were of like valiantnesse, but of sundrie dispositions and natures.
For Meilerius being ambitious and desirous of honour, referred all his dooings
to that end; and whatsoeuer he attempted, was to aduafice his fame and credit,
making more account to be reported and haue the name of a valiant man, than to
be so in déed. The other being of a certeine naturall disposition both noble and
valiant, was neither a gréedie séeker of laud and praise, nor an ambitious crauer of
fame and honour; but being alwaies among the best, did rather séeke and trauell
to the best, than to be onelie counted the best.</p>
<p part="N">Besides, he was naturallie indued with such a maidenlie shamefastnesse, and no
bragger nor boaster, would neither glorifie his dooings, nor yet like well of anie
others which would so doo of him. By means whereof it came to passe, that the
lesse ambitious and desirous he was of honour, the more the same followed him:
for glorie and honour follow alwaies vertue, as the shadow the bodie, shunning
them who doo most séeke for hir, &amp; following them who do lest regard hir, And
manie men are the more liked of manie, bicause they séeme not to like of anie: and
praise, fame, and honour most commonlie, the lesse it is estéemed, the more sooner
it is had &amp; gotten. It fortuned on a time that the armie thus being in Ossorie,
they did on a night incampe themselues about an old castell. These two gentlemen
as they were euer woont, laie togither, and suddenlie there was a great noise, as it
were of an infinit number of men, which séemed to breake in and rush in among
them, with great force and a rage, destroieng all that euer was, and making a great
noise with clashing of their harnesse, and striking of their bils togither, and therewithall
such a noise and a showt, as though heauen and earth would haue come
togither.</p>
<p part="N">These kind of phantasmes and illusions doo oftentimes happen in Ireland, especiallie
when there be anie hostings. With this noise the more part of the armie was
so afraid and dismaid, that for the most part they all fled, some into the woods, and
some into the bogs, euerie one séeking a place where to hide and succour himselfe.
But these two onelie tarieng behind, raught to their weapons, and foorthwith full
boldlie ran to Fitzstephans tents, and called againe togither all such as were thus
scattered, and incouraged them to take their weapons, and to stand to defense.

a man or two of his owne men about him, did aboue all others not without anie
great admiration of manie, and to the great gréefe of such as enuied him, best
acquit himselfe. For among other good gifts which were in him, this was speciallie
reported of him; that no feare, or force, no sudden mishap or misaduenture whatsoeuer,
could at anie time make him afraid or discomforted, and to flie awaie.
For howsoeuer things fell out and happened, he was alwaies at hand, and in a
dines with his weapons to fight. And such a one as is alwaies readie to abide
whatsoeuer shall happen, and to preuent what mischeefs maie insue, is by all mens
iudgements counted the best and valiantest man. This man was he, who in this
Irish warres was the first who either was striken or hurt. As concerning the foresaid
phantasme, this one thing is much noted of it; that in the morning following,
when all things were pacified and quieted, the grasse and weeds which the night
before stood there vpright and of a great height, did now in the morrow lie downe
flat vpon the ground, as though the same had bin troden with great multitude of
people, and yet was it most certeine that none had béene there at all.</p>
<p part="N">(1) There be two Ossories, the one named the vpper Ossorie, which is of the
aucient inheritance of the Macguilfathrikes, and who are the barous therof; and
this lieth in the diocesse of Leighling: the other lieth on the north of Ormond, and
is vnder the iurisdiction of the earle of Ormond, who is also the earle thereof, being
named earle of Ormond and Ossorie. It is a diocesse of it selfe, and the bishop
thereof is named the bishop of Ossorie, whose sée and house is at Kilkennie. It is
parcell of the prouince of Leinster and vnder the obeisance then of Dermon Mac
Morogh.</p>
<p part="N">(2) This was a courteous kind of punishing, for comonlie such is the reuenging
nature of the méere Irishman, that albeit he can or doo laie neuer so manie plagues
and punishments vpon his enimie: yet is he neuer satisfied, vnlesse he haue also his
life, yea and manie not therewith contented, but will vtter their wicked nature
euen vpon the dead carcase, as dooth appeare in this chapter of the same Mac
Morogh, who finding one of his enimies heads, was not satisfied, vntill in most
cruell maner he did with his téeth bite awaie his nose and his lips.</p>
<p part="N">(3) There are in Ireland thrée sorts or degrées of soldiers: the first is the horsseman,
who commonlie is a gentleman borne, and he is armed with such armor as the
seruice of that countrie requireth: the second degree is the Kernaugh, &amp; he also
is a gentleman or a fréeholder borne, but not of that abilitie to mainteine a horsse
with his furniture, and therefore he is a light souldier on foot; his armor is both
light and slender, being a skull, a left gantlet or a target, a sword and skeine, and
thrée or foure darts: the third degree is the Galloglasse, who was first brought in
to this land by the Englishmen, and thereof taketh his name. For Galloglas is to
saie, an English yeoman or seruant; his armor is a skull, a iacke, an habergeon or
shirt of male, a sword and a sparre, otherwise named a Galloglasse ax or halbert, &amp;
this man is counted the best souldier on foot, and the strength of the battell. These
in all hostings haue attending vpon them a number of boies and kernes, and who
doo spoile and kill all such as be ouerthrowne and hurt in the fields.</p>

<head>The conspiracie of Rothorike monarch of Ireland, and of the residue of the princes against Mac Morogh and Fitzstephans.</head>
<p part="N">IN the meane time the wheele of fortune is turned vpside downe, and they which
before séemed to stand aloft, are now afraid of sliding: and they which were on
high, in perill now to fall. For assoone as it was noised through the whole land of
the good successe of Dermon, and of the comming in of strangers into the land,
and whereof they were much afraid: Rothorike prince of (1) Conagh, and (2)
monarch of the whole land, coniecturing how of small things great doo grow; and
considering that by the comming in of strangers, the whole land was in some perill;
sendeth abrode his messengers, and summoneth a parlement of the whole land:
who being assembled, and the matter at full debated, they doo with one voice and
consent conclude and determine to make open warres, and to giue the battell vnto
Mac Morogh. And foorthwith euerie man hauing made readie both men and armor
to his vttermost power, doo ioine all their forces and strengths togither, and with
maine and strength doo inuade the countrie of Okensile in Leinster.</p>
<p part="N">Dermon Mac Morogh in this distresse was somwhat disquieted, and in a great
perplexitie; partlie bicause some of his (but glosing) fréends distrusting the sequele,
did shrinke from him, &amp; hid themselues: some of them most traitorouslie, contrarie
to their oth and promise, were fled to his enimies: and so in this his distresse he
had verie few fréends, sauing onlie Robert Fitzstephans and the Englishmen with
him. He therefore with such companie as he had, went vnto a certeine place not
farre from Fernes, which was compassed and inuironed round about with great thicke
woods, high stikle hilles, and with bogs and waters; a place so strong of it selfe, as
it was in a maner inaccessible, and not to be entred into. And as soone as they
were entred into the same, they foorthwith by the aduise of Fitzstephans (3) did
fell downe trées, plashed the wood, cast great trenches and ditches round about, and
made it so strict, narrow, crooked, and strong, that there was no passage nor entrie
for the enimie: and yet by their art and industrie it was made much more strong.</p>
<p part="N">(1) Conagh, in Latine Conacia, is one of the fiue portions of the land, according
to the ancient diuision. In it are thirtie cantreds or baronies; and before
and vntill the conquest they were under the gouernment of the sept of the O Conners,
the eldest man of which sept by the Irish law was ouer the prince: but at the
conquest it was giuen to certeine noble men of England, &amp; by certeine descents it
came to sir Walter de Burgo, who was lord of that whole prouince and earle of
Wolster. From these Burghs descend the Burghs now being in Conagh, they being
of a base line, and first were put onlie in trust to kéepe that countrie to the vse of
their lords, who then dwelled and remained in England. This countrie lieth betwéene
Vlster in the north, Mounster in the south, and the seas in the west. The
cheefest and onelie merchant towne or emporium thereof is Gallowaie.</p>
<p part="N">(2) There was alwaies one principall gouernor among the Irish, whom they
named a monarch; and he was commonlie either of the Mac Carthies in Mounster,
or of the Moroghs in Leinster, or of the O Connors in Connagh, as this Rothorike
was. He was elected &amp; chosen by the common consent of all the nobilitie of the
land: &amp; being once chosen, all they did homage and fealtie vnto him. The prouince
of Meth, which was the least of the fiue seuerall portions, was reserued alwais
vnto him for his diet. For though the Omolaghlins did dwell in Meth, and were

great inheritors or possessioners there, yet they were not counted for princes as
the other were. This monarch did gouerne the whole land vniuersallie, &amp; all the
princes were directed by him: in him it laie whether it should be peace or warre;
and what he commanded was alwaies doone.</p>
<p part="N">(3) The maner of the Irishrie is to kéepe them selues from force of the enimies,
or in the bogs, or in the woods: the one of his nature is so strong as no horsseman
is to aduenture into the same; the other with industrie they make strong, by felling
of trées &amp; plashing of the woods; and by these means the horssemen (in whom is
all the strength of their warres) can haue no passage nor entrie to the enimie, but
must either retire, or go on foot, or séeke some other waie. If they will and must néeds
passe that waie, they must of necessitie go on foot, and then they are too weake,
and easilie to be ouercome by the Kernes, whose seruice is onelie on foot: therefore
they doo chéefelie kéepe themselues in such places, as where they can take the aduantage
of others, and not others of them.</p>

<head>The description of Dermon Mac Morogb, and of the message of Rothorike O Connor sent vnto him for peace.</head>
<p part="N">DERMON Mac Morogh was a tall man of stature, and of a large and great
bodie, a valiant and a bold warrior in his nation: and by reason of his continuall halowing
and crieng his voice was hoarse: he rather chose and desired to be feared
than to be loued: a great oppressor of his nobilitie, but a great aduancer of the
poore and weake. To his owne people he was rough and greeuous, and hatefull
vnto strangers; he would be against all men, and all men against him. Rothorike
minding to attempt anie waie whatsoeuer, rather than to aduenture and wage the
battell, sendeth first his messengers with great presents vnto Fitzstephans, to persuade
and intreat him: that for so much as he made no chalenge nor title to the
land, that he would quietlie, and in peace returne home againe into his owne countrie,
but it auailed not. Then they went vnto Mac Morogh himselfe, &amp; persuaded
him to take part with Rothorike, and to ioine both their forces and armies in one,
and then with might and maine to giue the onset vpon the strangers, and so vtterlie
to destroie them. And in this dooing he should haue Rothorike to his good friénd,
and all Leinster in rest and quietnesse: manie reasons also they alledged concerning
their countrie and nation; but all was to no purpose.</p>

and an open enimie vnto all men, and who sometimes was an exiled man: sée how
he being inuironed with the force of strangers, is now returned, &amp; mindeth the
vtter destruction of vs all, and of this his nation. He enuieng the safetie of his
countrie and countrimen, hath procured and brought in a strange nation vpon vs,
that by the helpe of a hatefull people he might satisfie and more effectuallie accomplish
his malice, which otherwise by no means he could haue brought to passe.
He then being an enimie, hath brought in that enimie which hath béene euer hatefull
both vnto him, and vnto vs; and who are most gréedie to haue the souereigntie
&amp; dominion ouer vs all, protesting and openlie affirming, that by a certeine fatall
destinie they are to be rulers ouer this land: yea, &amp; so far hath he shed out his
venome, and almost euerie man is so inuenomed therewith, that now no fauor nor
mercie is so be shewed. O cruell beast, yea more cruell than euer was beast! for
to satisfie his insatiable malice, and to be auenged with the bloudsheding of his
owne people, he spareth neither himselfe, nor his countrie, nor sex. This is he
who is a most cruell tyrant ouer his owne people: this is he who with the force and
helpe of strangers vseth all force and crueltie against all men. He deserueth well
therefore to be hated of all, which séeketh to be an enimie vnto all. Looke therefore
(yee worthie citizens) well to your selues; I saie looke and consider well how
by these meanes, I meane by ciuill discord, all realmes &amp; nations haue for the most
part béene ouerthrowen &amp; vanquished. (1) Iulius Cesar minding to inuade Britaine
had the repulse twise, &amp; was driuen out by the Britons. But when Androgeus
fell at variance with the king, he then to be reuenged, sent againe for Iulius,
who thervpon returned and conquered the land. (2) The same Iulius also conquerd
all the west parts of the world, but when he waxed &amp; became ambitious, &amp;
would be a sole monarch, &amp; haue the whole gouernement in himselfe, then discord
was raised, &amp; debate was rite, &amp; by that meanes all Italie was filled with murthers
and slaughters. (3) The Britons being at discord with their king, procured Gurmundus,
who then was a terror to all the ocean Iles, that he with the Saxons should
pursue and make wars vpon their king, who so did: but in the end to their owne
confusion and destruction. Likewise not long after (4) Isembertus the French
king, being an enimie to his owne people, and at discord with them, he procured
the said Gurmund to aid and helpe him to subdue his people, who so did: but
thereof he had but bad successe. Wherfore let vs with one mind like to these
Frenchmen stand stoutlie to the defense of our countrie, and couragiouslie giue the
onset vpon our enimies. And whiles these strangers be but few in number, let vs
lustilie issue out vpon them: for fiue whiles it is but in sparkles is soone couered,
but when it is in great flames, it is the harder to be quenched. It is good therefore
to méet with things at the beginning, and to preuent sicknesse at the first growing:
for diseases by long continuance hauing taken déepe root, are hardle to be cured.
We therefore, who are to defend our countrie and libertie, and to leaue to our posteritie
an immortall fame: let vs valian lie, and with a good courage aduenture and
giue the onset, that the ouerthrow of a few may be a terror vnto manie; and that
by this example all other forren nations may be afraid to aduenture the like
attempt."</p>

nephue was slaine. The king much grieued therwith sent for the earle, whose name
was Androgeus: and bicause he would not come vnto him he made wars vpon him.
The earle considering in what distresse he was, and how farre vnable to incounter
the power and withstand the displeasure of the king, sendeth his messenger with
his letters vnto Iulius Cesar, and besought him most earnestlie to returne with his
armie, and he would aid and helpe him against the king with all the power he had.
Iulius Cesar glad of these tidings returneth with all spéed, and in the end hath the
victorie: and thus by meanes of debate and diuision the relme, which otherwise
was thought to be impregnable, was subuerted and made tributarie.</p>
<p part="N">(2) Iulius Cesar hauing happie and fortunate successe in all his affaires, grew into
such a liking of himselfe, that he would needs be the sole monarch and emperor ouer
the whole world, taking foule euill that according to the ancient gouernement of
the Romans anie one should be ioined with him: and ambitiouslie séeking the same,
he became dreadfull to the people, lothsome to his friends, and in the displeasure
of the senat: who maligning at his aspiring and mistrusting the sequele thereof,
conspired his death, and in the end he comming into the senat house, and mistrusting
nothing, was murthered and slaine.</p>
<p part="N">(3) At this time Careticus was king and ruled ouer Britaine, now named England,
who was so vitious a man in all respects, that he became hatefull both to God and
man: and his subiects not abiding his tyrannie, nor brooking his wickednesse, fell at
diuision with him. Wherevpon Gurmundus then king of Ireland was procured (some
saie by the Britons and some saie by the Saxons) who being entered into the land,
and séeking by all the meanes they could to be the sole lords of the land, to inuade
the land, which he did, and by the helpe of the Saxons droue the king out of his
realme into Wales. And the Saxons hauing thus their wils droue also all the Britons
out, who from thensefoorth hauing lost the land of Britaine, did inhabit themselues
in Wales, Cornewall, and elsewhere, where they might haue refuge and succour.
And thus though they were reuenged of their king, yet they themselues in the end
felt the smart thereof: for they were all destroied or banished: such are the fruits
of dissention and debate.</p>
<p part="N">(4) This Isembertus was not king of France, but as (Gaufred saith) was nephue
to the king: and the land being then in great troubles, this Isembert made title vnto
it, and seeking by all the meanes and waies he could how to compasse the same,
procured Gurmundus to helpe and aid him, promising him great rewards. Wherevpon
Gurmundus passed ouer into France, where he had but an euill successe: for
there was he slaine, Isembert ouerthrowne and the French nation preuailed. And
herevpon Rothorike taketh an occasion to incourage his people to stand to their

that by ambition and pride he measureth &amp; valueth his force and strength: but yet

large stipends, nor yet as couetous prollers for gaine and lucre: but onlie in respect

to rob and spoile, but as faithfull friends, to recouer and to restore this noble and
liberall gentleman to that his patrimonie, whereof he is spoiled and dispossessed.
He it is that hath allured and flocked vs hither; he it is that loueth our nation: and
he it is who purposeth to plant and settle vs and our heires in this Ile. And peraduenture

you? Is it anie other than a short delaie or distance of time, &amp; as it were a short
sléepe betwéene this transitorie life and the life eternall to come? What is death
(I saie) but a short passage from vaine and transitorie things to perpetuall and euerlasting
ioies? And certeine it is we must all once die: for it is that ineuitable destinie,
which is common to all men, and can be eschewed of no man: for be we
idle, and doo nothing worthie of perpetuall fame and memorie; or be we well occupied,
whereof insueth praise and honor: yet die shall we. Then the matter
being so, let them be affraied of death, who when they die, all things die with them:
but let not them shrinke nor be dismaied, whose vertue and fame shall neuer die but
liue for euer. Wherefore ye worthie men, who are enoblished for your valiantnes
and famous for your vertues, let vs with bold minds and good courages giue the

earle Richard had read these letters, he taketh aduise with his fréends, and taking
some comfort and stomach of the good successe of Fitzstephans, whereof he was
at the first both fearefull and doubtfull, fullie determineth to bend his whole force
and power to follow this seruice and hostings. This earle was a man of a verie noble
parentage, and descended of verie honorable ancestors; but yet more famous in
name, than rich in pursse; more noble in blood, than endowed with wit; and
greater in hope of succession, than rich in possessions. Well, he thought long yer
he could wend himselfe ouer into Ireland, and therefore to compasse the same to

<head>Of the arriuall of Reimond le grosse into Ireland, and of the fight which he had against the Waterford men at Dundorogh.</head>
<p part="N">THE king hauing heard the earles requests, bethought himselfe a while thereof:
but in the end he alowed not of the one, nor granted the other, but fed him still
with good spéeches, and nourished him with faire words, commending his noble
mind, that he would aduenture so honorable an enterprise. And in words the king
seemed to giue him leaue to follow his deuise, but to saie the truth, it was rather
in game than in earnest, for the king minded nothing lesse. But the earle taking
the aduantage of the kings words, and accepting the same for a sufficient leaue
and licence, returneth home. And the same being the winter season &amp; verie vnfit
to trauell into forren nations in martiall affaires, dooth now make preparation of all
things fit to serue when time should require. And assoone as the winter was past,

three score and ten archers well appointed, and taking shipping about the kalends
of Maie, then landed at the rocke of (1) Dundonolfe, which lieth south from Wexford,
and about foure miles east from Waterford: and there they cast a trench,
and builded a little castell or hold, with turffes and wattell. This Reimond was
nephue to Robert Fitzstephans and to Maurice Fitzgerald, being the sonne vnto
their elder brother named William, and was verie valiant, of great courage, and
well expert in the warres and in all martiall affaires. The citizens of Waterford,
and Omolaghlin Ofelin, being aduertised of this their arriuall, and nothing liking
the neighborhood of such strangers, take counsell togither what were best to be
doone: and finding it most necessarie and néedfull to withstand at the beginning,
they doo conclude and determine, to giue the onset vpon them; and being about

thrée thousand men, they take botes, and rowe downe the riuer of the Sure (which
fléeteth fast by the wals of Waterford on the east, and diuideth Leinster from
Mounster) and so came to the place where Reimond and his companie were, where
they landed and set their men in order for the assaults, and marched boldlie to the
ditches of Reimonds fortresse or castell: but then it appeered how valiantnes
can neuer be hid, lustie courage be daunted, nor yet prowesse or worthines be blemished.
For Reimond and his companie, although they were but few in number,
and too weake to incounter with so great a companie as their aduersaries were: yet
being of couragious minds &amp; lustie stomachs, went out to méet with their enimies;
but when they saw that their small number was not sufficient nor able in the plaines
to abide and indure the force of so great a multitude, they retired to their fort.
The enimies thinking then to discomfit and cleane to ouerthrow them, followed
and pursued them so shortlie, that the Englishmen were no sooner in at the gates,
but the Irishmen were also at their heales, and some of them within the gate.
Which thing when Reimond saw, and considering also with himselfe what a distrosse
and perill he and all his were in, suddenlie turneth backe his face vpon
his enimies; and the first of them which entred, he ranne him thorough with his
sword (or as some saie claue his head asunder) and then with a lowd voice cried
out to his companie to be of a good comfort. Who forthwith as they turned and
stood most manfullie to their defense: so their enimies also being dismaied and
afraid at the death of that one man, they all fled and ranne awaie: and then they
which in this doubtfull chance of fight, were thought should be vanquished and
cleane ouerthrowne, suddenlie became to be the victors and conquerors. And
these sharpelie then pursued their enimies, who were scattered abroad in the plaines
and out of arraie; that in a verie short time and space they slue aboue fiue hundred
persons: and being wearie with killing, they cast a great number of those
whome they had taken prisoners headlong from the rocks into the sea, and so
drowned them. In this fight and seruice a gentleman named William Ferand did
most valiantlie acquit himselfe. For albeit he were but of a weake bodie, yet was
he of a verie stout stomach &amp; courage: he was diseased and sicke of the leprosie,
and therefore desirous rather to die valliantlie, than to liue in miserie: and for that
cause would and did aduenture himselfe in places where most perill and danger
was and séemed to be; thinking it good with a glorious death to preuent the gréefe
and lothsomnesse of a gréeuous disease.</p>
<p part="N">Thus fell the pride of Waterford, thus decaied their strength and force, and thus
began the ruine and ouerthrow of that citie, which as it bred a great hope and consolation
to the Englishmen; so was it the cause of a great desperation and terror
to the enimies. It was a strange matter and nouer heard of before in those parties,
that so great a slaughter should be made by so small a number: neuerthelesse by
euill counseil and too much crueltie, the Englishmen abused their good successe
and fortune. For hauing gotten the victorie, they saued seuentie of the best citizens,
whom they kept prisoners; and for the ransome or redemptio of these,
they might haue had either the citie of Waterford yeelded &amp; surrendred vnto them,
or such a masse of monie as they would themselues. But Herueie of Mount Moris
(who came ouer with three gentlemen of seruice, and ioined with his countrimen

<p part="N">REIMOND being verie desirous that the captiues taken might be deliuered,
laboreth by all the waies he could how to compasse the same, &amp; in presence of
Herueie maketh these spéeches, and vseth these persuasions to all his companie.
"Yée my noble and valiant companions and souldiers, for increase of whose honour,
vertue and fortune séeme to contend; let vs now consider what is best to be
doone with these our prisoners and captiues. For my part I doo not thinke it good,
nor yet allow that anie fauour or courtesie should be at all shewed to the enimie.
But vnderstand you, these are no enimies now, but men; no rebels, but such as
be vanquished and cleane ouerthrowen, and in standing in defense of their countrie,
by euill fortune and a worse destinie they are subdued. Their aduentures
were honest and their attempts commendable, and therefore they are not to be reputed
for théeues, factious persons, traitors, nor yet murtherers. They are now
brought to that distresse and case, that rather mercie for examples sake is to be
shewed, than crueltie to the increasing of their miserie is to be ministred. Suerlie
our ancestors in times past (although in déed it be verie hard to be doone) were
woont in times of good successe and prosperitie, to temperat their loose minds and
vnrulie affections with some one incommoditie or other. Wherfore let mercie and
pitie, which in a man is most commendable, worke so in vs, that we who haue
ouercome others, may also now subdue our owne minds, and conquer our owne
affections: for modestie, moderation, and discretion are woont to staie hastie motions,
and to stop rash deuises. O how commendable and honorable is it to a noble

that he can reuenge and be wreaked?</p>

his trecherie acquited. And thus as his pitie did much increase his honour, so did
it nothing hinder his victories. O how beastlie then and impious is that crueltie,
wherin victorie is not ioined with pitie? For it is the part of a right noble and a valiant
nman, to count them enimies which doo wage the battell, contend and fight
for the victorie; but such as be conquered, taken prisoners, and kept in bonds
and captiuitie, to take and repute them for men, that hereby fortitude and force
may diminish the battell and end the quarrell, as also humanitie may increase loue
&amp; make peace. It is therefore a great commendation and more praiseworthie to a
noble man in mercie to be bountious, than in victorie to be cruell; for the one
lieth onelie in the course of fortune, but the other in vertue: and as it had béene
a great increase of our victorie, and an augmentation of honour, if our enimies
had béene slaine in the field and ouerthrowen in the battell: so they being now
taken and saued, and as it were men returned from rebels to the common societie
and fellowship of men; if we should now kill them, it will be to our great shame,
dishonor, and reproch for euer. And for so much as by the killing and destroieng
of them we shall be neuer the néerer to haue the countrie, nor neuer sooner to be
the lords of the land; and yet the ransoming of them verie good for the maintenance
of the souldiers, the good fame of vs, and the aduancement of our honour:
we must néeds thinke it better to ransome them than to kill them. For as it is
requisit and meet, that a souldier in the field fighting in armes, should then thirst
for the bloud of his enimies, trie the force of his sword, and valiantlie stand to his
tackle for victorie: so when the fight is ended, the wars are ceassed, &amp; the armor
laid downe, and all fiercenes of hostilitie set apart; then in a noble man must humanitie
take place, pitie must be shewed, and courtesie must be extended."</p>

<head>The oration or speech which Herueie made.</head>
<p part="N">WHEN Reimond had ended his speech, &amp; the whole companie being in a muttering,
and as it were men well pleased and verie well allowing his mind and opinion:
then Herueie stood vp and spake to them all in this maner. "Reimond hath verie
exquisetlie discoursed with vs of pitie and mercie, and in set speeches vttering
his eloquence, hath shewed his mind and declared his opinion; persuading and
inducing vs to beléeue, that a strange land were to be conquered sooner by mercie
and fond pitie than by sword and fire. But I praie you, can there be a worsse
waie than so to thinke? Did Iulius Cesar or Alexander of Macedonie by such
means or in such order conquer the whole world? Did the nations from out of
all places run to submit themselues vnder their yoke and empire, in respect of their
pitie &amp; mercie, &amp; not rather compelled so to doo for feare &amp; perforce? For
people, whiles they are yet proud and rebellious, they are (all pitie and mercie set
apart; by all manner of waies and means to be subdued: but when they are once
brought into subiection and bondage, and redie to serue and obeie, then they are
with all courtesie to be intreated and dealt withall: so that the state of the gouernment
may be in safetie and out of danger. Herein and in this point must
pitie be vsed, but in the other seueritie or rather crueltie is more necessarie: here
clemencie is to be shewed, but in the other rigour without fauour is to be exhibited
and vsed. Reimond persuadeth that mercie is to be extended, as vpon a
people alreadie subdued and subiected; or as though the enimies were so few and
of so small a number, as against whome no valiant seruice nor chiualrie can be

exploited, and yet they redie to ioine with vs: whereby our force may be increased,
and our power augmented. But alas! Doo not we sée how that the whole nation
and people of Ireland are wholie bent, and not without cause altogither conspired
against vs?</p>
<p part="N">"Suerlie me thinketh Reimond is contrarie vnto himselfe; for why, his comming
hither was not to dispute of pitie, nor to reason of mercie; but to conquer the
nation and to subdue the people. O what an example of impious pitie were it then,
to neglect our owne safetie, and to haue remorse and compassion vpon others distresses?
Moreouer, we haue here in the fields, and in armour more enimies than
friends, we are in the middle of perils and dangers, our enimies being round about
vs in euerie place: and shall we thinke this to be nothing, but that we must be
also in the like distresse and danger among our selues. Round about vs our enimies
are infinit, and within our selues some there be which practise our destruction.
And if it should happen that our captiues and prisoners should escape and breake
loose out of their bonds, which are but verie weake and slender, no doubt they
will foorthwith take our owne armours and weapons against vs. Well well, the
mouse is in the cupbord, the fire is in the lap, and the serpent is in the bosome;
the enimie is at hand readie to oppresse his aduersarie, and the gest is in place with
small courtesie to requit his host. And I praie you dooth not Reimond execute

contrarie to his deeds? Let him answer me to this. If our enimies when they
come in good araie and well appointed to giue the onset, and to wage the battell
against vs, if they should happen to haue the victorie and the ouerhand ouer vs,
would they deale in pitie &amp; mercie? Would they grant vs our liues? Would they
put vs to ransome? Tush what néed manie words when the déeds are apparant?
Our victorie is to be so vsed, that the destruction of these few may be a terror
to manie; wherby all others and this wild and rebellious nation may take an example,
and beware how they meddle and incounter with vs. Of two things we
are to make choise of one; for either we must valiantlie and couragiouslie stand
to performe what we haue taken in hand; and all fond pitie set aside, boldlie and
stoutlie to ouerthrow and vanquish this rebellious and stubborne people: or (if we
shall after the mind and opinion of Reimond altogither be pitifull and full of mercie)
we must hoise vp our sailes and returne home, leauing both the countrie and
our patrimonie to this miserable and wretched people." Herueies opinion was best
liked, and the whole companie allowed his iudgement, wherevpon the captiues (as
men condemned) were brought to the rockes, and after their lims were broken,
they were cast headlong into the seas, and so drowned.</p>

saieng of Merlin; "A great forerunner of a greater follower shall come, and he
shall treadie downe the heads of Desmond and Leinster, and the waies before opened

fortie gentlemen of seruice. And on the morrow vpon saint Bartholomews daie,
being tuesdaie, they displaied their banners, and in good arraie they marched to
the wals of the citie, being fullie bent and determined to giue the assault: the citizens
&amp; such others as had escaped at Dundorogh manfullie defending themselues,
and giuing them two repulses. Reimond who by the consent and assent of the
whole armie was chosen and made generall of the field, and tribune of the host,
hauing espied a little house of timber standing halfe vpon posts without the wals,
called his men togither, and incouraged them to giue a new assault at that (1)
place. And hauing hewed downe the posts wherevpon the house stood, the same
fell downe togither with a peece of the towne wall; and then a waie being thus
opened, they entred into the citie, and killed the people in the streets without pitie
or mercie, leauing them lieng in great heaps; and thus with bloodie hands they obteined
a bloodie victorie. In the tower called (2) Reinolds tower they tooke two
murtherers prisoners, whom they vnarmed and killed; also they tooke there Reinold,
and Machlathilen Ophelan prince of the Decies: but these were saued by
meanes of the comming and suite of Mac Morogh, who was also come thither with
Maurice Fitzgerald and Robert Fitzstephans. And when they had set the citie

at the doore of a certein ancient man of the citie, they did not onelie there murther

the earle had spent a few daies in the citie, about setting and setling the same in
good order, he left the same to the charge and gouernance of Miles Cogan: but
he himselfe by the persuasion of Mac Morogh (who sought by all the waies he could,
how to be reuenged vpon Ororike king of Meth) inuaded the borders of Meth, and
wasted, spoiled, and destroied the same. All Meth being in the end wasted by the
sword and fire; Rothorike king of Connagh thought with himself what might
hereof befall vnto him, bicause his neighbors house being set on fire, his was next
to the like perill: he sent his messengers vnto Dermon Mac Morogh with this message.
"Contrarie to the order of the peace, thou hast procured, called, and
flocked into this land a great maltitude and number of strangers, and as long as
thou didst staie and kéepe thy selfe within thy owne countrie of Leinster, we bare
therwith, and were contented. But forsomuch as now not caring for thy oth, nor
regarding the safetie of thy hostages, thou hast so fondlie &amp; lewdlie passed thy
bounds: I am to require thée, that thou doo retire and withdraw these excurses of
strangers; or else without faile I will cut off thy sonnes head, &amp; send it thée."
Mac Morogh when he heard this message, full stoutlie answered, and said he
would not giue ouer that which he had begun, nor desist from his enterprise, vntill
he subdued all Connagh his ancient inheritance, as also he had recouered the monarchie
of all Ireland. Rothorike being aduertised of this answer, was somwhat
warmed and offended therwith, &amp; forthwith in his rage commanded Mac Moroghs

one Amelaus, the eldest of three brethren named Ostimen or Easterlings: which
came first out of Norwaie, or (as some write) out of Normandie, and did inhabit
the land. It was first named Aghalia, that is, the towne of hurdels; for it standeth
somewhat low and in a marish ground: and bicause when the same was first builded,
the laborers were woont and did go vpon hurdels, it tooke the name thereof. It

were almost consumed, by reason that vpon the kings commandement a restraint

not what to doo. And in this their case see the course and nature of fortune, who

ancestor was Tros the founder of the most famous citie of Troie, and he descended
from Dardanus the sonne of Jupiter, from whom is deriued vnto vs not onlie the
stemme of ancient nobilitie, but also a certeine naturall inclination of valiant
minds, &amp; couragious stomachs, bent to follow all exploits ill prowesse and chiualrie,
and wherein all our ancestors haue béene verie skillfull and expert. And shall we
now like sluggards degenerate from so noble a race, and like a sort of cowards be
afraid of these naked and vnarmed rascalls, in whome is no valor of knowledge nor
experience in armes? Shall such a rabble of sauages pinne vs vp within the walles
of this little Dublin, and make vs afraid of them; when in times past all the
princes of Gréece kept warres for ten yeares &amp; od moneths continuallie against
our ancestors in the famous citie of Tróie, and could not preuaile against them,
vntill they vsed treasons and practised treacheries, which bred vnto them a more
infamous victorie than a glorious triumph? Shall the honor of our ancestors be
witihered by our sluggishnesse, and the glorie of their prowesse he buried in our
cowardnesse? Shall we be afraid of a few, and vnarmed, when they withstood
infinit multitudes of the most worthiest andl valiantest personages then in all the
world? Let it neuer be said, that the bloud of the Troians shall be stained in our
pusillanimitie, and receiue reproch in our follie.</p>
<p part="N">"And what though our enimies be neuer so manic, and we in respect of them but
a handfull; shall we therefore be afraied; as though victorie stood in multitude,
and conquest in great numbers? No no, kings be not so saued nor princes doo so
conquer: for a few men well disposed and a small number well incouraged, are
sufficient to incounter with a greater number, being wretches and sluggards. For
fortune though she be purtraied to be blind, as one void of right iudgement; and
to stand vpon a rolling stone, as being alwaies fléeting and mooueable: yet for
the most part she helpeth such as be of bold minds and of valiant stomachs. If
time did serue as matter is full and plentious, I could hereof recite manie yea
infinite examples. (1) Thomiris the Scithian queene, did not she with a few hundreds
incounter with the great monarch Cyrus, hauing manie thousands, andl
tooke him and slue him. Alexander wsith a few Macedonians, did not he ouercome
Darius the great monarch of the Persians, and take him, his wife, and daughters
prisoners, &amp; made a conquest of all Persia? (2) Leonides the Spartan, did not
he with six hundred men breake into the campes of the mightie Xerxes, and
there slaie flue thousand of them? Let vs come a little néerer euen to our selues,
who haue had in our owne persons, and in this land the like successes, namelie
you my right honourable earle at Waterford, and my vncle Fitzstephans at Wexford;
and I my selfe at Dundorogh: small were our companies, and little was our
force in respect of theirs, and yet we few thorough our valiantnesse ouercame and
conquered them being manie.</p>
<p part="N">"What shall I trouble you with the recitall of examples, sith time shall sooner
faile than matter want: and shall we then giue ouer and be white liuered? Shall we
like cowards couer our progenie, our nation, and our selues also, with perpetuall
shame and infamie? God forbid. My mind then and opinion is, that we doo issue
out vpon them, as secretlie and as suddenlie as we maie, and boldlie giue the onset
vpon them. And forsomuch as Rothorike of Connagh is the generall of tle field,
in whom lieth the chiefe force, and on whom all the rest doo depend, it shall be best
to begin with him, and then if we can giue the ouerthrow vnto him, all the residue
will flie, and we shall obteine a glorious victorie: but if we shall fall into their hands
and be killed, yet shall we leaue an honourable report and an immortall fame to all
our posteritie." When Reimond had ended his spéeches and finished his oration,
euerie one so well liked thereof, as with one consent they gaue ouer, and yéelded
to his resolution and opinion.</p>

hearing of this, was not so much grieued with sorrow for the death of hir sonne,
as inflamed with the desire to be reuenged. And she likewise faining her selfe to

<head>The description of Robert Fitzstephans.</head>
<p part="N">O NOBLE man, the onelie patterne of vertue, and the example of true industrie
and labours: who hauing tried the variablenesse of fortune, had tasted more aduersitie
than prosperitie! O worthie man, who both in Ireland and in Wales had
traced the whole compasse of fortunes wheele, and had endured whatsoeuer good
fortune or euill could giue! O Fitzstephans, the verie second an other (1) Marius,
for if you doo consider his prosperitie, no man was more fortunate than he: and
on the contrarie, if you marke his aduersitie, no man was or could be more
miserable. He was of a large and full bodie, his countenance verie comelie: and
in stature he was somewhat more meane: he was bountifull, liberall, and pleasant,
but yet sometimes somewhat aboue modestie giuen to wine and women. The earle
(as is aforesaid) marched with his armie towards Wexford, fast by Odrone, which
was a place full of streicts, passes, and bogs, and verie hardlie to be passed through:
but yet the whole power, force, and strength of all Leinster came thither, and met
him and gaue him the battell, betwéene whom there was a great fight, and manie
of the enimies slaine. But the earle with the losse of one onelie yoongman recouered
himselfe in safetie to the plaines, and there amongst others, Mcilerius
shewed bimselfe to be a right valiant man.</p>
<p part="N">(1) This Marius was named Caius Marius, his father was borne in Arpinum, &amp;
from thence came to Rome, and there dwelt, being a poore artificer and handicrafts
man, but much relieued by Metellus a noble Roman, in whose house, and
vnder whom, both the father and the sonne were seruants: but being giuen
altogither to martiall affaires, he became a verie valiant man, and did as
good seruice to the citie of Rome as anie before or after him. Affrica he conquered,
and in his first triumph Iugurtha and his two sonnes were bound in chaines, and
caried captiues to Rome before his chariot. The Cambrians, Germans, and
Tigurians wanting habitations, and thinking to settle themselues in Italie, trauelled
thitherwards for the same purpose; but being denied by the Romans, the made
most cruell warres vpon them, and slue of them at one time fourescore thousand
souldiers, and thréescore thousand of others, wherewith the state of Rome and
of all Italie was so broken, and ouerthrowne, that the Romans much bewailedl
themselues, &amp; did thinke verelie that they should be vtterlie destroied. In this

distresse Marius tooke the matter in hand, and méeting first with the Germans,
gaue them the battell, slue their king Teutobochas, and two hundred thousand
men, beside fourescore thousand which were taken. After that he met with the
Cambrians, and slue their king Beleus, and an hundred and fortie thousand
with him, as also tooke fortie thousand prisoners. For which victorie he triumphed
the second time in Rome, and was named then the third founder of Rome. Againe
in the ciuill wars which grew by the means of Drusius, all Italie was then in armes,
and the Romans in euerie place had the worse side (for all Italie began to forsake
them) and in this distresse Marius hauing gotten but a small power in respect of
the enimies, giueth the onset vpon the Marsians, and at two times he slue fouretéene
thousand of them: which so quailed the Italians, and incouraged the
Roomans, that the Romans recouered themselues and had the maistrie. As in the
warres so otherwise was Marius very fortunate: for being but of a base stocke,
yet he mariedl Julia, a noble woman of the familie of the Julies, and aunt
vnto Iulius Cesar: he passed thorough the most part of the offices in Rome: he
was first <emph>Legatus à senatu</emph>, then <emph>Præjectus equirum:</emph> after that <emph>Trihunus plebis,
Prœtor, Acdilis,</emph> and seuen times was he consull. And as fortune séemed to
fanour and countenance him aboue all other in Rome; so did she also checke him
with great reproches, &amp; burdened him with great miseries. For his pride was so
excessiue, and his ambition so intollerable, that the best and most part of the
Romans deadlie hated and enuied him: and therefore when he laboured to be
<emph>Aedilis, Prœtor, &amp; Tribune</emph>, he was reiected; he was accused for ambition, and
proclamed a traitor and an enimie to the common-wealth: he was inforced to
forsake Rome and flie into Affrike. Also being at the seas, the mariners cast him
on land among his enimies, and draue him to shift for himselfe. When he was
pursued by his enimies, he was faine to hide himselfe in a bog, and couered himselfe
with dirt &amp; mire because he would not be knowne. Neuerthelesse he was
taken and deliuered to a slaue to be killed. Manie other stormes of aduersitie and
miserie did he abide and indure, and therefore it was said of him, that in miserie
no man was more miserable, and in felicitie none more fortunate and happie than
he.</p>

<p part="N">THE king being thus landed at Waterford, and there resting himselfe; the
citizens of Wexford, vnder colour and pretense of great humblenesse and dutie,
and in hope of some thanks, they brought Robert Fitzstephans bound as a captiue
and a prisoner, and presented him to the king as one who deserued small fauor or
courtesie, that he had without his consent &amp; leaue entered into Ireland, &amp; giuen
thereby an occasion to others to offend and to doo euill. The king not liking of
him, fell out with him, and charged him verie déepelie and sharplie for his rash
and hastie aduentures, and that he would take vpon him to make a conquest of
Ireland without his assent and leaue: and forthwith commanded him to be handlocked
and fettered, with an other prisoner, and to be safelie kept in Renold
tower. Then Dermon Mac Arth prince of (1) Corke eame to the king of his owne
frée will, submitted himselfe, became tributarie, and tooke his oth to be true and
faithfull to the king of England. After this the king remooued his armie and
marched toward (2) Lisemore, and after that he had tarried about two dales, he
went to (3) Cashill, and thither came vnto him at the riuer of (4) Sure, Donold
prince of (5) Limerike: where when he had obteined peace, he became tributarie
and swore fealtie. The king then set (of his men) rulers and kéepers ouer the
cities of Corke and Limerike.</p>
<p part="N">Then also came in Donold prince of Ossorie, and Macleighlin O Felin prince of
the Decies, and all the best &amp; chiefest men in all Mounster, &amp; did submit themselues,
became tributaries and swore fealtie. Whome when the king had verie
liberallie rewardedl, he sent them home againe: and he himselfe returned backe
againe to Waterford through (6) Tibrach. When he came to Waterford,
Fitzstephans was brought before him, &amp; when he had well beheld him, and considered
with himselfe the valiantnesse of the man, the good seruice he had doone,
&amp; the perils &amp; dangers he had beene in: he began to be mooued with some pitie
and compassion vpon him, and at the intercession &amp; by the mediation of certeine
noblemen, he heartilie forgaue him, and released him from out of bonds, and
restored him wholie to his former state and libertie, sauing that he reserued to himselfe
the towne of Wexford, with the territories and lands therevnto adioining: &amp;
not long after some of those traitors, who thus had betraied him, were themselues
taken and put to death.</p>
<p part="N">(1) Corke, in Latine named <emph>Corcagium,</emph> is an ancient citie in the prouince of
Mounster, and builded (as it should appeare) by the Easterlings or Norwaies. It
standeth now in a marish or a hog, and vnto it floweth an arme of the seas, in the
which are manie goodlie receptacles or harboroughs for ships, &amp; much frequented
as well for the goodlie commodities of fishings therein, as also for the trade of
merchandize, by the which the citic is chieflie mainteined: for the inhabitants are
not onlie merchants &amp; great trauellers themselues; but also great store of strange
merchants doo dailie resort &amp; traffike with them. It is walled round about, and
well fortified for a sufficient defense against the Irishrie. In it is the bishops sée
of that diocesse, being called by the name of the bishop of Corke. The citie is
gouerned by a maior and two bailiffes, who vsing the gouernement according to
the lawes of England, doo keepe and mainteine the same in verie good order.

They are verie much troubled with the enimie, and therefore they doo continuallie,
as men lieng in a garison, keepe watch and ward both daie and night. The prince
of that countrie did most commonlie kéepe &amp; staie himselfe in all troubles within
that citie, vntill the time the same was conquered by the Englishmen, who euer
since haue inhabited in the same.</p>
<p part="N">(2) Lisemore in times past was as faire a towne as it is ancient, and standeth vpon
a goodlie riuer, which floweth vnto Youghall, and so into the maine seas. It was
sometimes a bishoprike, but of late vnited to the bishoprike of Waterford, and so
it lieth in the countie and diocesse of Waterford, but the soile it selfe was within the
countie of Corke.</p>
<p part="N">(3) Cashill is an old ruinous towne, but walled, and standeth vpon the riuer
Sure. In it is the see and cathedrall church of the bishop, bearing the name therof,
who is one of the foure archbishopriks of that land, and vnder him are the bishops
of Waterford, Corke, and seuen others.</p>
<p part="N">(4) The Sure is a goodlie and a notable riuer, and one of the chiefest in that
land. It hath his head or spring in a certeine hill called Blandina, but in Irish
Sloghblome, for the pleasantuesse thereof. Manie good townes are seated and
builded vpon the same, &amp; it is nauigable more than the one halfe. It fléeteth from
the spring or head fast by the towne of Thorleis, whereof the earle of Ornond is
baron: from thense to the holie crosse and so to Clomnell, &amp; from thense to Carig
Mac Griffith, where is an ancient house of the earles, sometime named the earles of
the Carig, but now earles of Ormond; and from thense fleeting by Tibrach, it
commeth to Waterford; and fléeting by the wals thereof, it runneth into the
seas.</p>
<p part="N">(5) Limerike is one of the first cities builded by the Norwaies or Easterlings, named
sometimes Osto men: the founder whereof was the yoongest of thrée brethren
whose name was Yuorus. It standeth vpon the famous and noble riuer of Shenin,
which goeth round about it, the same being as it were an Iland. The seat of it
is such, as none can be more faire or more statelie. It lieth in the maine land
within the prouince of Mounster, called the north Mounster, and is front the
maine seas aboue fortie miles, and yet at the wals euen the greatest ship at the
seas maie be discharged and vnfaden, and yéerelie so there are: for the citie it
selfe is chieflie inhabited by merchants. It is gouerned by a maior and bailiffes
ater and according to the English lawes and orders. It was in times past vnder a
particular prince of it self, but euer since the conquest it hath béene inhabited by
the Englishmen, who doo so still continue therin.</p>
<p part="N">(6) Tibrach is an old towne, which in times past was rich and verie well inhabited,
it lieth vpon the north side of the Sure, and about two miles from Carig Mac
Griffith. In it is a great stone standing, which is the bound betwéene the counties
of Kilkennie and Ormond.</p>

O Carell of Uriell &amp; Ororike of Meth: all which yeelded &amp; submitted them

But Rothorike the monarch came no néerer than to the riuer side of the (1) Shenin,
which diuideth Connagh from Meth, &amp; there Hugh de Lacie and William
Fitzaldeline by the kings commandement met him, who desiring peace submitted
himselfe, swore allegiance, became tributarie, and did put in (as all others did)
hostages and peldges for the kéeping of the same. Thus was all Ireland sauing
Vlster brought in subiection, and euerie particular prince in his proper person did
yéeld and submit himselfe, sauing onelie Rothorike, the then monarch of all
Ireland; and yet by him and in his submission all the residue of the whole land
became the kings subiects, and submitted themselues. For indéed there was no
one nor other within that land, who was of anie name or countenance, but that
he did present himselfe before the kings maiestie, and yéelded vnto him subiection

<p part="N">And then was fulfilled the old and vulgar prophesie of S. Molin; "Before him all

flée to his light, and the greater birds shall be taken &amp; brought into captiuitie,
and their wings shall be burned." Also the old prophesie of Merlin Ambrose; "Fiue
portions shall be brouglht into one, &amp; the sixt shall breake and ouerthrow the
walles of Ireland. That which Ambrose nameth heere the sixt, Celidonius nameth
the fift, as appeareth in his booke of prophesies. Now when the feast of Christmasse
did approch and draw neere, manie and the most part of the princes of that land
resorted and made repaire vnto Dublin, to sée the kings court: and when they
saw the great abundance of vittels, and the noble seruices, as. also the eating of
cranes, which they much lothed, being not before accustomed therevnto, they
much woondered and maruelled thereat: but in the end they being by the kings
commandement set downe, did also there eat and drinke among them. At this
time there were certeine soldiors, being bowmen, seassed at Finglas, and they
hewed and cut downe the trees which grew about the churchyard, which had
beene there planted of old time by certeine good and holie men: and all these
soldiors suddenlie fell sicke of the pestilence and died all: as is more at large

Mounster and Meth: his head and spring is in the hill named Thorne, which bordereth
vpon O Connor Slegos counttie, not farre from the riuer of the Banne in
Vister, and in length is supposed to be about a hundred and twentie English
miles. It is increased with sundrie brooks, and diuerse riuers run into the same;
the chéefest whereof is that which riseth and commeth out of the logh or lake
Foile. In it are manie loghs or lakes of great quantitie or bignesse, which are
maruelouslie replenished and stored with abundance of fish; the chéefest of which
are the logh Rie, and the logh Derigid. It is nauigable aboue thrée score miles,

he be kin to anie of the parties, shall contribute anie thing therevnto: but as they
be guiltlesse from the murther, so shall they be frée from paiment of monie, for

sundrie good men, and especiallie of Philip earle of Flanders (who was but then

That none should be accounted thensefoorth to be lawfull king of England, vntill

such people as were fled or banished out of the realme for his sake, to returne home

<head>The vision which appeared vnto the king at his being at Cardiffe.</head>
<p part="N">BUT before we doo proceed anie further, it were not amisse to declare what
happened and befell vnto the king in his returning through Wales, after his comming
from Ireland. In his iourneie he came to the towne of Cardiffe on the saturdaie
in the Easter wéeke, and lodged there all that night. On the morrow being
sundaie, and commonlie called little Easter daie or Low sundaie, he rwent somewhat
earlie to the chapell of saint Perian, and there heard diuine seruice, but he
staied there in his secret praiers behind all his companie, somewhat longer than he
was woont to doo: at length he came out, and leaping to his horsse, there stood
before himl one hauing before him a stake, or a post pitched in the ground. He
was of colour somewhat yellowish, his head rounded and a leane face, of stature
somewhat high, and aged about fortie yeares; his apparell was white, being close
&amp; downe to the ground, he was girded about the middle, and bare footed. This
man spake to the king in Dutch, saieng; "God saue thée O king," and then said
thus vnto him: "Christ and his mother Marie, Iohn baptist, and Peter the apostle
doo salute thée: and doo strietlie charge and command thee, that thou doo forbid,
that hensefoorth throughout all thy kingdome and domions, there be no faires nor
markets kept in anie place vpon the sundaies: and that vpon those daies no maner
or person doo anie bodilie worke, but onelie to serue God, sauing such as be appointed
to dresse the meat. If thou wilt thus doo, all that thou shalt take in hand
shall prosper, and thy selfe shalt haue a happie life." The king then spake in French
to the gentleman, who held his horsse by the bridle, and whose name was Philip
Meitros, a man borne in those parts, and who told me this tale: "Aske him whether
he dreame or not." Which when he had so doone, tlhe man looking vpon the
king said: "Whether I dreame or not, marke well and remember what daie this
is; for if thou doo not this, and speedilie amend thy wicked life, thou shalt before
the yeare come about heare such euill news of those things which thou louest best,
and thou shalt be so much vnquieted therewith, that thou shalt not find anie ease

words areigned his horsse and said; "Call me yonder fellow againe." Whelevpon
the foresaid gentleman as also one William, which two were onelie then attending
vpon him, first called and then sought him in the chappell, and, finding him not
there, sonught him throughout the court, the towne, and in all the Ins, but could
not find him. The king being verie sad and sorie that he had not throughlie talked
with the man, went abroad himselfe to seeke him, but finding him not, called for
his horsses and rode from thence by Rempinbridge to Newberie. And as this man
had before threatned and said, it so came to passe before the yeare was ended: for
his eldest sonne Henrie, and his two yoonger sonnes Richard earle of Aquitaine,
and Geffreie erle of Britaine, in the Lent following forsooke and shroonke from
him, and went to Lewes the French king. Whereof grew and insued vnto him
such vexation and vnquietnesse, as he had neuer the like before, and which by one
means and other neuer left him vntill his dieng daie. And suerlie it was thought
the same by Gods iust iudgement so befell vnto him: for as he had béene and was
a disobedient sonne to his spirituall father, so his carnall sonnes should be disobedient
and rebellious against their carnall father. Manie such forewarnings the king
had by Gods mercie and goodnesse sent vnto him before his death, to the end he
should repent and be conuerted, and not be condemned; which would to God that
euerie prince and other man did not frowardlie and obstinatlie condemne, but rather
with an humble and a penitent heart they would (as they ought to doo) receiue
and imbrace the same! And therefore I haue and mind to write more at large in

<p part="N">IN the meane time Ireland was in good rest and peace, vnder such as vnto

of certeine iniuries doone vnto him, praieng redresse: wherevpon the daie and a
place of (1) parlée was betweene them appointed for the same. The night next
before the daie of this parlée, a yoong gentleman named Griffith, the nephue of
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Griffiths dreame.</note>
Robert Fitzstephans, and Maurice Fitzgerald, being the sonne to their eldest brother
named William, dreamed in his sléepe that he saw a great heard of wild hogs
to rush and run vpon Hugh de Lacie and his vncle Maurice; and that one of them
being more horrible and greater than the rest, had with his tusks rent and killed
them: if he had not with all his force and strength rescued them, and killed the
bore. On the morrow according to appointment, they came to the place appointed
for the parlée, which was a certeine hill called Ororikes hill; but before they came
to the verie hill it selfe, they sent messengers the one to the other, requiring assurance
and safetie: and hauing sworne on each part to kéepe faith and truth, they
came to the place appointed and there met, but yet a small companie on either
side. For it was agréed vpon on both parties, &amp; by couenant excepted, that on each
part they should bring but a few and the like number, and they to be all vnarmed;
the swords on one side and the spars on the other side, and for all the residue of
the people and companie to stand aloofe and a farre off. But Griffith, who came
to the said parlée with his vncle Maurice, was verie pensife and much troubled,
concerning the vision which he saw in his sleepe; and doubting of the worst,
made choise of seuen of the best gentlemen of his kindred, whome he knew to be

to the one side of the hill, but as néere to the place of parlée as he could, where
euerie of them hauing his sword, spar and shield; lept and mounted vp to their
horsses, and ranging the fields they made sundrie carreers and lustie turnaments,
vnder the pretense and colour of plesantnes and pastime; but in verie déed to be
in a readinesse if need should so require.</p>
<p part="N">Hugh de Lacie and Ororike this meane while were talking and discoursing of
manie things, but concluded not of anie thing; neither did Ororike meane anie
such thing. For hauing a traitorous mind, and watching his time when he might
best powre out his venem, fained himselfe to go out and abroad to make water,
and vnder that colour beckened vnto his men, with whome he had concluded and
agreed before, that with all hast they should come awaie vnto him and they foorthwith
in all hast so did, and he also then with a pale, grim, and murtherous countenance,
hauing his ax or spar vpon his shoulder, returned backe againe. Maurice
Fitzgerald, which was before warned by his cousine Griffith and aduertised of
his dreame, gaue good eie and watched the matter verie narowlie; and therefore
all the parlée time, he had his sword readie drawne about him: and espieng the
traitor to be fullie bent and about to strike Hugh de Lacie, he cried out vnto him,
willing him to looke vnto himselfe, and to be at defense with himselfe; wherewith
the traitor most violentlie strake vnto him, thinking verelie to haue murthered
and dispatched him. But the interpretor of the parlée stepping in betwéene, saued
Hugh de Lacie; but he himselfe was wounded to death, and his arme cleane
cut off.</p>
<p part="N">Then Maurice Fitzgerald with a lowd voice cried out to his companie, who with
all hast came awaie; and then began a hot and a sharpe bickering of the English
swords against the Irish spars. In which skirmishing Hugh de Lacie was twise
felled to the ground, and had suerlie béene killed, if Maurice had not valiantlie
rescued him. Likewise the Irishmen who were manie in number, they hauing
espied the becking of the traitor, they came running in all hast out of the vallies
with their weapons, thinking verelie to haue made a cleane dispatch and a full end
of Hugh de Lacie and of Maurice Fitzgerald. But Griffith and his companions,
still watching for that which indéed did happen, were at the first call of Maurice
in a readinesse, and being on horssebacke they came awaie with all speed; which
thing when the traitor saw, he gan to distrust, and thought to shift himselfe awaie
and so to escape. But as he was leaping to his horsse, Griffith was come, and with
his staffe or lance strake downe and ran through both horsse and man: who being
thus striken downe and killed, as also three other of his men, who brought him
his horsse and were in this bickering, they cut off his head frm the bodlie, and
sent it ouer into England to the king. The residue of the Irishmen fled foorthwith
and ranne awaie, but being hardlie pursued euen to the verie woods, there
was a great discomfiture and slaughter nmade of them. Rafe the sonne of Fitzstephans,
being a lustie and a valiant yoong gentleman, did well acquite himselfe,
and deserued great commendation for his good seruice.</p>

<head>Sundrie examples concerning visions.</head>
<p part="N">FOR so much as there be sundrie opinions and iudgments concerning visions,
it shall not be much amisse, or impertinent to our matter, to recite a few examples
&amp; true reports of the same. Valerius Maximus in his first booke and seauenth chapter
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Prognosticall dreames.</note>
writeth, that two men of Arcadia, iournieng togither in companie towards a
towne named Megara, when they came thither, the one of them lodged himselfe
with his fréend, but the other at a common Inne. He who laie in his fréends
house being in bed and asléepe, dreamed that his companion came vnto him, and
requested him to helpe him, bicause his hoast did oppresse him; wherewith he
awooke, but verie shortlie he fell asléepe againe, and dreamed that his said companion
came againe vnto him being verie sore wounded, and praied him that although
he would not at the first time come and helpe him, yet that he would now
reuenge his death, declaring that his host had taken his head and corps, and put
it into a cart to be caried to the dunghill, and there to be buried. This man being
awaked, and much troubled with this dreame, arose and sought for his fellow,
and finding his dreame to be true, caused the hoast to be taken and apprehended,
who for that his fact was executed and put to death. Aterius Rufus a gentleman
of Rome likewise, being on a time at Siracusa, he dreamed that he was killed by
a maister of fense, which came so to passe: for on the morrow after he was present
at the plaie or game of swordplaiers or maisters of defense, whereas a (1) netcaster
was brought in to fight with a swordplaier. Wherevpon Aterius vttering his dreame
to him that sat next by him, would haue gone and departed awaie; but being persuaded
to the contrarie, did staie to his owne destruction. For the netcaster hauing
ouerthrowne the swordplaier, and thinking to haue pearsed him through with
his sword, missed him and stroke Aterius, who sat in place next therevnto, and so
was he slaine. Also Simonides the poet, being on a time set on land vpon the sea
shore, he saw there a dead man lieng vnburied. The night following he dreamed
that the said dead man did aduise and admonish him, that he should not take ship
the daie following: but his felowes minding not to lose anie time, and the weather
seeming then to be faire, they went all aboord, and hoised vp their sailes; which
Simonides refused to doo, and tarried at land. It was not long after but that the
weather waxed to be fowle, and the seas to be high, and in the end both the ship
and men to be all lost: but Simonides crediting his dreame, was saued. Moreouer
Calphnrnia, the wife vnto Iulius Caesar, the night before hir husband was slaine,
dreamed that she saw him greatlie wounded to lie in hir lap: wherewith she being
afraid did awake, and told Iulius hir dreame, requesting him that he would forbeare
to repaire to the senat house that daie: but he giuing small credit to a womans
dreame, followed his mind and was slaine by the senators. But to leaue these examples
fetched fromi out of other nations, let vs come neere home to our selues.

selfe readie on a time to serue in a certeine hosting against his enimie; the night
before he should fake his iournie, he dreamed that my mother who was dead on
long before, did come vnto him, and aduise &amp; warne him, that if he loued his life
he should in anie wise refraine and forbeare that iournie. She in déed was not his
naturall mother, but his mother in law, and yet loued him in hir life time as intirelie
as hir owne child. When he had told this his dreame to his father and mine,
for indéed we were both brothers by one father, though we had not one mother:
he also gaue him the like aduise and counsell, but he of his presumptuous mind,
not regarding the same, followed his owne mind, and the same daie was killed by
his enimie.</p>
<p part="N">(2) As dreames sometimes are good forewarnings to men to eschew euils which
are towards, yet they are not alwaies to be so receiued, as prognostications infallible.
For sometimes the same fall out to the contrarie, as dooth appeere by
Augustus the emperor; who hauing warres against Brutus and Cassius, and he
by reason of his sicknesse carried in a litter, his physician Arterius dreamed that
the goddesse Minerua did appeére vnto him, willing him to aduise and counsell
the emperor, that he should not by reason of his sicknesse come into the field,
nor be present in the battell, which he did. But the emperor notwithstanding
entered into the field, being carried in his litter, and tooke maruellous great pains.
And albeit Brutus taking the emperors tents, séemed to haue the victorie; yet was
he for all that vanquished, and the emperor had the conquest. Likewise in west
Wales, of late yeares, it happened a certeine rich man dwelling on the north side
of a certeine mounteine, he dreamed thrée nights togither, that there was a chaine
of gold hidden in the head stone, which couered and laie vpon a certeine well
or founteine, named saint Bernaces well, and that he should go and fetch it. This
man at length, somwhat beléeuing the dreame, and minding to trie the same, went
to the place, and did put his hand into the hole or place: but his hand was no
sooner in, but that it was bitten, stoong, and enuenomed with an adder. Wherefore
a man may sée hereby what credit is to be giuen to dreams, and I for my
part doo so credit of them as I doo of rumors. But concerning such visions as
God dooth send by his angels to his prophets and holie men, we must otherwise
thinke of them; bicause the effect of them is most vndoubted, certeine, and
assured.</p>
<p part="N">(1) The Romans had diuerse games, plaies, and exercises amongst themselues,
and had for the same certeine amphitheaters and theaters made of purpose, wherein
the people might sit to view and behold the same. Of these plaies or games some
were of cruel beasts the one fighting with the other, some of men fighting with
beasts, and some of men fighting the one with the other, and these plaies were
called <emph>Ludi gladiatorij,</emph> games of sword plaieng or fighting: for as in combates in
England, so they being vnharnessed, did fight with their swords or weapons in the
open sight of the people, indeuouring ech one to kill the other, which were spectacles
of crueltie to harden the peoples hearts against killing in the warres. Of
these some were called <emph>Mirmillones,</emph> which were such as chalenged the fight; some
were called <emph>Gladiatores,</emph> and these were such as we doo name masters of defenses,
bicause they vsed onelie or cheeflie the sword; and some were called <emph>Retiarij,</emph> and
these besides their weapons did vse a certeine kind of net, which in ftigting they
were woont to take and intrap their enimies, and such a one was this man, who
fighting with a chalenger, did by chance misse him and kill Aterius.</p>
<p part="N">(2) In the old and first ages, men were much giuen to dreames and visions: and

of Iacob, king Pharao, king Nabuchodonozor, Mardocheus, Daniell, Iudas Machabeus,
Hercules, Pyrrhus, Cicero, Cassius, Parmensis, &amp; manie others dreamed
dreames, and the same came to passe. But yet these being but particular examples,
and which it pleased God for some secret cause to vse: they are not to be drawne
for presidents and examples to be dailie or in these daies vsed; but rather we must
haue a respect and a regard to Gods speciall commandement, who by the mouths
of his prophets hath vtterlie forbidden vs to listen to anie dreamer, or to giue credit
vnto his words. "Thou shalt not (saith he) hearken to the words of a dreamer of
dreames, for dreames haue deceiued manie a man, and they haue failed them who
haue put their trust in them: for whie, they are full of deceipts and guiles, and
inuented either for the maintenance of superstition and error, or for the increasing
of some filthie lucre and gaine." Phauorinus therefore inueighing against the Chaldeans,
who were a people which were woont to relie much vpon dreames, willeth
and aduiseth that no dreamer or interpreter of dreames should be sought or dealt
withall. "For (saith he) if they tell thee of anie good thing, and in the end doo
deceiue thee, thou shalt be in miserie to hope in vaine for the same. If they tell
thée of some misfortune, and yet doo lie, yet shalt thou be in miserie, bicause
thou shalt be still in feare least it may happen. And likewise if they shew thée
of euill haps, and the same doo so follow, thou shalt be in miserie and vnquieted,
that thy fortune and destinie is so euill. But if they tell thee of good things, and
it be long yer the same doo happen, thou shalt be much vnquieted to looke so long
for it; and alwaies in feare least thine expectation shall be frustrated: wherefore
in no wise doo thou séeke anie such persons, nor giue anie credit vnto them."</p>

The elder king the father was verie much troubled and vnquieted for and about

<p part="N">In this warre the king had taken prisoners the king of Scots, the earles of Chester
and of Leicester, besides so manie gentlemen and good seruitors both English
and French, that he had scarse anie prisons for so manie prisoners, nor so manie
fetters for so manie captiues. But forsomuch as in vaine dooth a man triumph
of the conquests vpon others, who cannot also triumph of the conquering of himselfe;
and although the king had indured and abiden manie storms, great vnquietnesse,
and much trouble and at length hauing ouercommed both them and his
enimies, he might the sooner haue béen wreaked and auenged of them; yet setting
apart those affections euen in the middle of his triumphs vpon others, he also triumphed
ouer himselfe; vsing such kinds of courtesies &amp; clemencies as before had
not beene heard. For suppressing his malice and reuenging mind, he gaue honor
to his aduersaries, &amp; life to his enimies. And the warres thus after two yeares
ended, and all the great stormes ouercommed, he granted peace to all men, and
forgaue ech man his offense and trespasse. And in the end-also his sonnes repenting
their follies, came and submitted themselues, with all humblenesse yéelding themselues
to his will and pleasure.</p>

<head>The description of king Henrie the second.</head>
<p part="N">IT were not now amisse, but verie requisit that we should (for a perpetuall
remembrance of the king) describe and set foorth as well the nature and conditions
of his inward man as of his outward; that men which shall be desirous hereafter
to learne and read his most noble acts in chiualrie, may also as it were before their
eies conceiue his verie nature and liuelie portraiture: for he being so noble an
ornament to this time and our historie; we might not well, neither dooth this
historie permit vs to omit and passe him ouer in silence. Wherein we are to craue
pardon that we may plainelie declare and tell the truth: for in all histories the perfect
and full truth is to be alwaies opened, and without it the same wanteth both
authoritie and credit: for art must follow nature. And the painter therfore, whose
profession and art is to make his protraiture as liuelie as may be, if he swarue
from the same, then both he and his worke lacke and want their commendation.
And albeit no man be borne without his fault, yet is he most to be borne withall who
is least spotted: &amp; him must we account and thinke to be wise, who knowledgeth
the same: for whie, in all worldlie matters there is no certeintie; and vnder heauen
is no perfect felicitie, but euill things are mixt with good things, and vices ioined
with vertues. And therefore, as things spoken in commendation either of a mans
good disposition, or of his worthie dooings, doo delight and like well the hearer:
euen so let him not be offended, if things not to be well liked be also recited and
written. And yet the philosophers are of the opinion, that we ought to reuerence
so the higher powers in all maner of offices and dueties, as that we should not prouoke
nor mooue them with anie sharpe spéeches or disordered languages. For (as
Terence saith) faire words and soothing speeches bréed fréendship, but plaine telling
of truth makes enimies. Wherfore it is a dangerous thing to speake euill against
him, though the occasion be neuer so iust, as who can foorthwith auenge the
same. And it is a matter more dangerous, and he aduentureth himselfe verie far,
which will contend in manie words against him, who in one or few words can wreake
the same. It were suerlie a verie happie thing, and that which I confesse passeth

my reach, if a man intreating of princes causes might tell the truth in euerie thing,
and yet not offend them in anie thing. But to the purpose.</p>
<p part="N">Henrie the second, king of England, was of a verie good colour, but somewhat
red; his head great and round, his eies were fierie, red, and grim, and his face
verie high coloured; his voice or speech was shaking, quiuering, or trembling;
his necke short, his breast-brode and big, strong armed, his bodie was grosse, and
his bellie somewhat big, which came vnto him rather by nature than by anie grosse
feeding or surfetting. For his diet was very temperat, and to saie the truth, thought
to be more spare than comelie, or for the state of a prince: and yet to abate his
grossenesse and to remedie this fault of nature, he did as it were punish his bodie
with continuall exercise, and did as it were kéepe a continuall warre with himselfe.
For in the times of his warres, which were for the most part continuall to him, he
had little or no rest at all; and in time of peace he would not grant vnto himselfe
anie peace at all, nor take anie rest; for then did he giue himsele wholie vnto
hunting, and to follow the same he would verie erlie euerie morning be on horssebacke,
and then into the woods, sometimes into the forrests, and sometimes into
the hilles and fields, and so would he spend the whole daie vntill night. In the
euening when he came home, he would neuer or verie seldome sit either before or
after supper: for though he were neuer so wearie, yet still would he be walking
and going. And forsomuch as it is verie profitable for euerie man in his life time,
that he doo not take too much of anie one thing; for the medicine it selfe which
is appointed for a mans helpe &amp; remedie, is not absolutelie perfect and good to be
alwaies vsed: euen so it befell and happened to this prince; for partlie by his excessiue
trauels, and partlie by diuerse bruses in his bodie, his legs and féet were swollen
and sore. And though he had no disease at all, yet age it selfe was a breaking sufficient
vnto him. He was of a resonable stature, which happened to none of his
sons; for his two eldest sons were somwhat higher, &amp; his two yoonger sons were
somewhat lower and lesse than was he. If he were in a good mood, and not angrie,
then would he be verie pleasant and eloquent: he was also (whicl was a thing verie
rare in those daies) verie well learned; he was also verie affable, gentle, and courteous;
and besides so pitifull, that when he had ouercome his enimie, yet would
he be ouercome with pitie towards him.</p>
<p part="N">In warres he was most valiant, and in peace he was as prouident and circumspect.
And in the wars mistrusting and doubting of the end and euent therof, he would
(as Terence writeth) trie all the waies and meanes he could deuise rather than wage
the battell. If lie lost anie of his men in the fight, he would maruellouslie lament
his death, and séeme to pitie him more being dead than he did regard or account
of him being aliue, more bewailing the dead than fauouring the liuing. In times
of distresse no man more courteous, and when all things were safe no man more
hard or cruell. Against the stubborne &amp; vnrulie no man more sharpe, nor yet to
the humble no man more gentle; hard toward his owne men and houshold, but
liberall to strangers, bountifull abrode, but sparing at home: whom he once hated,
he would neuer or verie hardlie loue; and whom he once loued, he would not
lightlie be out wit him, or forsake him : he had great pleasure and delight in hawking
andl hunting. Would God he had béene as well bent and disposed vnto good
deuotion!</p>
<p part="N">It was said that after the displeasure growne betwéene the king and his sonnes,
by the meanes and thorough the intising of the queene their mnoother, he neuer accounted
to kéepe his word and promise, but without anie regard or care was a common
breaker thereof. And true it is, that of a certeine naturall disposition he was
light and inconstant of his word: and if the matter were brought to a narrow
streict or pinch, be would not sticke rather to couer his word, than to denie his

déed. And for this cause he in all his dooings was verie prouident and circumspect,
and a verie vpright and a seuere minister of iustice, although he did therein greeue
and make his friends to smart. His answers for the most part were peruerse and
froward. Iustice which is God himselfe is fréelie and without rewards to be ministred.
And albeit for profit and lucre all things are set to sale, and doo bring great
gaines as well to the clerie as to the laitie: yet they are no better to a mans heires
or executors, than were the riches of (2) Gehezi the seruant to Elizeus, whose
gréedie takings turned himselfe to vtter ruine and destruction.</p>
<p part="N">He was a great peacemaker, and a carefull keeper thereof himselfe: a liberall
almes giuer, and a speciall benefactor to the holie land, he loued humilitie, abhorred
pride, and much oppressed his nobilitie. The hungrie he refreshed, but the rich
he regarded not. The humble he would exalt, but the mightie he disdained. He
vsurped much vpon the holie church, and of a certeine kind of zeale, but not
according to knowledge; he did intermingle and conioine the prophane with holie
things; for why, he would he all in all himselfe. He was the child of the holie
church, and by hir aduanced to the scepter of his kingdome, and yet he either
dissembled or vtterlie forgat the same: for he was slacke alwaies in comming to
the church vnto the diuine seruice, and at the time thereof he would be busied
and occupied rather in counsels and in conference about the affaires of his comnmonwealth,
than in deuotion and praier. The liuelihoods belonging to anie spirituall
promotion, he would in time of vacation confiscat to his owne treasurie, and
assume that to himselfe which was due vnto Christ. When anie new troubles or
wars did grow or come vpon him, then would he lash &amp; powre all that euer he had
in store or treasurie; and liberallie bestow that vpon a roister or a soldier, which
ought to haue beene giuen vnto the priest. He had a verie prudent &amp; forecasting
wit, and therby foreseeing what things might or were like to insue, he would accordinglie
order &amp; dispose either for the performance, or for the preuenting thereof:
notwithstanding manie times the euent happened to the contrarie, and he disappointed
of his expectation: and commonlie there happened no ill vnto him, but
he would foretell therof to his friends and familiars.</p>
<p part="N">He was a maruellous naturall father to his children, and loued them tenderlie in
their childhood and yoong yeares: but they being growne to some age and ripenesse,
he was as a father in law, and could scarselie brooke anie of them. And
notwithstanding they were verie handsome, comelie, and noble gentlemen: yet
whether it were that he would not haue them prosper too fast, or whether they had
euill deserued of him, he hated them; &amp; it was full much against his will, that they
should be his successors, or heires to anie part of his inheritance. And such is the
prosperitie of man, that as it can not be perpetuall, no more can it be perfect and
assured: for why, such was the secret malice of fortune against this king, that
where he should haue receiued much comfort, there had he most sorrow: where
quietnesse &amp; safetie, there vnquietnesse and perill: where peace, there enimitie:
where courtesie, there ingratitude: where rest, there trouble. And whether this
happened by the meanes of the (3) marriages, or for the punishment of the fathers
sinnes: certeine it is, there was no good agréement, neither betweene the father &amp;
the sonnes, nor yet among the sonnes themselues.</p>
<p part="N">But at length, when all his enimies and the disturbers of the common peace were
suppressed; and his brethren, his sonnes, and all others his aduersaries as well at
home as abroad were reconciled: then all things happened and befell vnto him
(though it were long first) after and according to his owne will and mind. And
would to God he had likewise reconciled himselfe vnto God, and by amendement
of his life had in the end also procured his fauour and mercie! Besides this, which
I had almost forgotten, he was of such a (4) memorie, that if he had once séene

and knowne a man, he would not forget him: neither yet whatsoeuer he had heard,
would he be vnmindfull thereof. And hereof was it, that he had so readie a memorie
of histories which he had read, as a knowledge and a maner of an experience
in al things. To conclude, if he had béene chosen of God, and béene obsequious
and carefull to liue in his feare and after his laws, he had excelled all the
princes of the world: for in the gifts of nature no one man was to be compared
vnto him. Thus much brieflie, and yet not much besides the matter, I haue thought
good to deliuer, that hauing in few words made my entrie; other writers maie haue
the better occasion more at large to discourse and intreat of this so worthie an historie.
And therefore leauing the same to others, let vs returne to our Ireland,
from whense we digressed.</p>
<p part="N">(1) The words are <emph>Oculis glaucis:</emph> which some doo English to be greie cies, like
the colour of the skie, with specks in it: but some doo English it a bright red, as
is the colour of a lions eie, which is commonlie a signe or an argument of a man
which will be soone warmed &amp; angrie: &amp; so it is to be taken in this place: for the
words, which follow, be: <emph>Ad iram toruis,</emph> which is to saie, grim looking eies disposed
to anger: which eies were answerable to the complexion and disposition of
this king.</p>
<p part="N">(2) This historie is written in the fift chapter of the second booke of the kings,
&amp; in effect is this. When the prophet Elisha or Elizeus had healed Naaman the
Syrian of his leprosie, he would haue rewarded the prophet, &amp; haue giuen great
and rich gifts: but he refused the same and would none thereof, wherefore Naaman
departed awaie. But Gehezi the seruant of the prophet, being touched with
a greedie and a conetous mind, and angrie that his master had refused such rich
presents, secretlie he ran after the Syrian; and ouertaking him, did aske of him
in his masters name a talent of siluer, &amp; certeine garments: which he receiued
doubled, and returned therewith. But he was no sooner come home, but that his
couetousnesse was rewarded, and he plagued with the leprosie of Naaman, which
cloue vnto him as white as the snow.</p>
<p part="N">(3) The king maried Eleanor the daughter and heire to the erle of Poitiers (who
before was maried to Lewes the eight and king of France, but diuorsed from him
for néerenesse of blood) and after that lie had continued with hir sundrie yeares,
and receiued byhir six sonnes and thrée daughters, he fell in loue with a yoong
wench named Rosamund, and then waxed wearie of his wife. And she to be awreaked,
did not onelie in continuance of time find the means to find out thhis Rosamund,
who was kept secret in a house builded like a labyrinth of purpose for hir safe kéeping
at Woodstocke, where when the quéen had found hir, Rosamund liued not
long after: but also for a further reuenge, she by means of hir sonnes who were
noble &amp; valiant gentlemen, caused warres to be sturred and raised against the king
to his great vnquietnesse; and this is one of the mariages of which this author
meaneth. The other was of his son named Henrie, whome lie did not onelie make
and crowne king in his life time, but also for a confirmation of a peace to be had
betwéene him and Lewes the eight then French king, he maried his said sonne to
the ladie Margaret daughter to the said French king. By reason whereof his said
sonne being once come to yéeres of age, and thinking it too long yer he could
haue the sole gouernment, as also being by the quéene his mother intised, and
taking hir part, he fled to the French king his father in law; and by his aid, as
also of sundrie other noble men both English and French, who ioined with him,
made warres vpon his said father: which bred vnto himl no little trouble and vnquietnesse.</p>

is the gift of a quicke and good memorie: for by it knowledge dooth increase and
experienceis perfected. And therefore saith Cicero, that memorie is the treasurie
of all good things, and most necessarie to the life of man: wherein the more
the gouernor excelleth, the more prouident is his gouernment. For why, as Plutarch
writeth, the remembrance of things past are speciall presidents and examples
of things to come. Diuers and sundrie men haue béene famous, and much
commended for their excellencie in this vertue. Mithridates king of Pontus in
Asia had vnder his dominion two and twentie nations, and he was of such singular
nemorie, that he did not onelie vnderstand their seuerall languages, but also spake
them perfectlie: and in iudgements would heare each man to speake in his owne
language, and answer them in the same. Cyrus king of Persia, the sonne of
Cambises, so excelled in memorie, that hauing an excéeding great multitude of
men in his host, he would call euerie man by his proper name and surname. Cineas
an ambassador from king Pyrrhus to the Romanes, was not in Rome aboue one
whole daie, before he could salute euerie of the senators, and euerie noble man of
Rome by his particular name. Likewise Iulius Caesar and Adrianus the emperors
of Rome were of such excellent memories, that euerie of them at one instant could
both read and write, as also speake and heare. The like also is said of the famous
and most excellentlie learned man Erasmus Roterodamus, who hauing alvaies or for
the most part sundrie and diuers clearks writing at one time and instant, of sundrie
matters, would walke vp and downe among them, and indite to euerie one
what he should write. And this thing is so necessarie in all princes, that in the
old ages they were euer woont to haue about them such men as were of a speciall
memorie; to put them in mind of all such things as to them should be méet and
requisite, and these were called Nomenclatores. Whether this king had any such
attending vpon him or not, it is certeine that he himselfe was of an excellent good
memorie.</p>

The earle is sent backe againe into Ireland, and is made generall of the land, and Reimond is ioined in commission with him.</head>
<p part="N">ERLE Richard, being now returned into Ireland, the people there being aduertised
of the great trubles which were beyond the seas, they being a people
constant onlie in inconstancie, firme in wauering and faithfull in vntruths; these
(I say) and all the princes of that land, the earle at his comming found to be
reuolted and to become rebels. For the recouerie and suppressing of whom, the
earle then wholie bestirred himselfe; and at length hauing spent and consumed all
his treasure, which he had brought ouer with him, his soldiors who were vnder
the guiding of Herueie being then constable, lacked their wages and were vnpaid:
and by reason of the emulation betwéene Herueie and Reimond, the seruice and
exploits to be doon against the Irishrie was verie slacke and slender; and by that
meanes they wanted such preies and spoiles of neat and cattell as they were woont
to haue for their vittels. The souldiors in this distresse, wanting both monie for
their wages and vittels for their food, assembled themselues and went vnto the
earle, vnto whome with one voice they exclamed and said; that vnlesse he would
make and appoint Reimond to be their capteine againe, they would without all
doubt forsake him, and would either returne home againe, or (that which is worse)
would go and serue vnder the enimies.</p>
<p part="N">In this distresse was Reimond appointed the capteine, &amp; forthwith hauing
mustered his souldiers, he made a rode or iourneie into Ophalia vpon the rebels
there, where he.tooke great preies, and were well recouered as well in horsse as
in armor. From thense they marched to Lismore, where when they had spoiled
both the towne and countrie, they returned with great booties, taking the waie
vnto Waterford by the sea side: and being come to the sea shores, where they
found thirteene botes latelie come from Waterford, as also others of other places;
all these they laded with their preies, minding to haue passed by water vnto
Waterford. But tarieng there for a wind, the men of Corke, who had heard of
their dooings, and being but sixtéene miles from them, doo prepare two and
thirtie barks of their owne towne, and doo well man and furnish them, being
wholie determined to set vpon Reimond, and if they can to giue him the ouerthrow;
which they did: betwéene whom was a cruell fight, the one part giuing a fierce

onset with stones and spaths, &amp; the other defending themselues with bowes and
weapons. In the end the men of Corke were ouercome, and their capteine named
Gilbert Mac Turger was there slaine by a lustie yoong gentlemen named Philip
Welsh. And then Adam Herford, who was the generall or admerall of that nauie,
being well increased and laden with great preies, sailed with great triumph to the
citie of Waterford.</p>
<p part="N">But Reimond himselfe was not present at this fight vpon the water, and yet
hearing thereof, he came in all hast and marched towards them, taking his waie
by the sea side, hauing in his companie twentie gentlemen, and thréescore horssemen.
And by the waie in his iourneie he met with Dermond Mac Artie prince of
Desmond, who was comming with a great band of men to helpe and rescue the
men of Corke where they fought togither: but in the end Mac Artie had the worse
side, and was ouerthrowne; and then Reimond hauing preied and taken about
foure thousand head of neat, he marched and came to Waterford. About this
time also as they marched homewards, certeine Irishmen in those parties lieng
skulking &amp; lurking in the woods, when the preies and cattell passed by, they
issued out, tooke and carried awaie certeine of the cattell into the woods, wherevpon
the crie was vp, and came as farre as Waterford. Wherevpon the souldiers
and most part of the garison issued out, among whom Meilerius was the best and
most forward. For he being come to the woods, and hauing in his companie then
onelie one souldier, put spur to the horsse, and aduentured in the woods, following
the Irishmen (by the abetting of the souldier who was with him) euen to the
furthest &amp; thickest part of the woods; where he was so farre entered, that he was
in danger of the enimie: and the souldier being not able to retire was there taken,
killed and hewed in péeces. Meilerius then séeing himselfe to be inuironed round
about with the enimies, and he in the like perill as the other was, bicause he alone
against a thousand was neither able to rescue his man, nor helpe himselfe, but in
danger to be taken as was the other, like a valiant gentleman draweth his sword,
and with a lustie courage, euen in despite of their téeth maketh waie through them.
And such as set vpon him he spared not, but cut off an arme of this man, a hand of
that man, a head of one, and a shoulder of another, &amp; he escaped throughout
them without anie harme or hurt to his owne bodie, sauing that he brought two
darts in his shield, and thrée in his horsse.</p>

rose vp against the Englishmen, and the earle as it were a man besieged, kept
himselfe within the wals and citie of Waterford, and from whence he mooued not.
But Rothorike Oconor prince of Connagh, comming and passing ouer the riuer of
Shenin, thinking now to recouer all Meth, inuadeth the same with sword and fire,
and spoileth, burneth, and destroieth the same, &amp; all the whole countrie euen to
the hard walles of Dublin, leauing no castell standing or vndestroied.</p>
<p part="N">(1) These Ostomen were not Irishmen, but yet of long continuance in Ireland.
Some saie they came first out of Norwaie, and were called Ostomen, that is to saie
Easterlings, or Easterne men, bicause that countrie lieth East in respect of England
and Ireland. Some thinke they were Saxons and Normans; but whatsoeuer
they were, they were merchants and vsed the trade of merchandize, and in
peaceable maner they came into Ireland; and there being landed they found such
fauour with the Irishrie, that they licenced them to build hauen townes wherein
they might dwell &amp; vse their traffike. These men builded the ancientest and most
part of the cities and towns vpon or néere the sea side within that land; as namelie
Dublin, Waterford, Corke, Limerike, and others. And albeit they in processe of
time grew to be mightie and strong, and for their safetie did build townes and
castels: yet they durst not to dwell among the Irish people, but still continued
and kept themselues within their owne townes and forts, and thereof they are and
were called since townesmen. And of them were these, being the inhabitants of
Dublin, which came to méet the earle, and were thus slaine.</p>

<head>The returning of Reimond into Ireland, and how he married Basilia the sister vnto the earle.</head>
<p part="N">THE earle then seeing himselfe to be now in great distresse, and in a narrow

the faire ladie, whom he had long wooed, loued, and desired; but also that he
might helpe and succour his lord and maister in this distresse and necessitie.
Wherefore he maketh preparation accordinglie, and by means of friendship and
otherwise, he had gotten thirtie lustie yoong gentlemen of his owne coosins and

him. And as soone as the shipping for them was readie, and the wind seruing, he
and his coosin Meilerius, with all the said companie tooke the seas, and shortlie after
arriued in twentie barks vnto (1) Waterford.</p>
<p part="N">At the verie same time the townesmen of Waterford, being in a verie great rage
and furie against the Englishmen there, were fullie minded and determined to haue
killed them all wheresoeuer they could find them. But when they saw these
barks comming in with their flags, hanging to their top masts, which to them were
vnknowne, they were astonied at their so sudden comming, and their deuises were
dashed. Reimond foorthwith entered the towne with all his companie; and when
all things were quieted and appeased, he &amp; the earle went from thense vnto Wexford,
with all their force and strength, leauing behind one (2) Precell or Purcell
his lieutenant at Waterford. But he verie shortlie minding to follow after the earle,
tooke a boat, and as he passed oner the riuer of the Sure, the maister of the boat
and his companie yhich were townesmen of Waterford, slue this Purcell, and those
few whom he had then attending vpon him. Which murther when they had thus
doone, they returned to the citie, and there without all pitie o. mercie, spared
neither man, nor woman, nor child; but slue as manie as they could find in the
streets, houses, or anie other places. Howbeit the citie it selfe was safelie kept by
such as were then in Reinolds tower, who draue the traitors out of the citie, as also
in the end compelled them to yéeld and submit themselues, and to intreat for peace,
which they hardlie obteined, both with an euill credit and harder conditions.</p>
<p part="N">But Reimond still mindfull of the promise made vnto him, and he languishing
vntill the same were performed, would not depart from out of Wexford, vntill
messengers were sent to (3) Dublin to fetch and bring his louer Basilia to (4)
Wexford to be maried vnto him. Which being doone, and he maried, they spent
all that daie and night in feastings &amp; pastimes. And as they were in their most
iollitie, newes was brought vnto them, how that Rothorike prince of Connagh had
destroied, wasted, &amp; spoiled all Meth, and was entred into the borders of DublinWherevpon
Reimond on the next morrow, setting apart and giuing ouer all
wedding pastimes, mustereth all his souldiors, and without anie delaiengs marcheth
towards the enimies. But Rothorike who had before tried his valiantnesse, and
experimented his force, hearing of his comming, and not minding to trie or abide
the same, retireth backe, and getteth him to his owne home and countrie. Then
Reimond recouereth againe all those countries, and foorthwith causeth all the
forts and castels then before pulled downe and defaced, to be now reedified and
repared, as also the castels of Trim, and of Dunlences in Meth, of which Hugh
Tirell was before the conestable, and for want of rescue and helpe compelled to
leaue and forsake them. And thus by the means of Reimond, all things being
recouered and restored to their former and pristine estate, the whole land for feare
of him continued a good time in peace and rest.</p>
<p part="N">(1) There is great varietie in such bookes and examples as I haue, and which
I doo follow in this point: some writing that Reimond did not land at Waterford,
but at Wexford; and the tumult there being appeased, he went from thense vnto
Waterford, and brought the earle vnto Wexford. Some write againe (as is aforesaid)
that he landed at Waterford, and not at Wexford: but hauing saluted the earle,
appeased the tumult, and set all things in order, he conducted the earle and the
whole armie ouer land vnto Wexford. Although there be some variance in the
exemplars, yet concerning the substance of the historie it is not materiall.</p>

for they of that name were seruitors in this conquest, and for their good seruice
they were rewarded with lands and territories, and who are yet remaining about or
néere the citie, and in the countie of Waterford.</p>
<p part="N">(3) It is certeine that this Basilia abode at Dublin, but whether she were there
married or at Wexford it is doubted. Some hold opinion, that Reimond after
that he had met and also saluted the erle, they foorthwith hearing the countries
in Leinster, and especiallie about Dublin to be in an vprore, marched thither
straitwaie without anie staie. And there Reimond as a lustie soldior in his armor
married the ladie Basilia, and they issued with aduantage vpon the enimie. But

<head>The titles of the kings of England vnto Ireland.</head>
<p part="N">LET then the enuious &amp; ignorant cease and giue ouer to quarrell, and avouch that
the kings of England haue no right nor title to the realme of Ireland. But let them
well vnderstand that by fiue maner of waies, tlat is to saie, by two ancient titles,
and three latter they haue to auouch and defend the same, as in our topographie is
declared. First it is euident and apparent by the histories of England, that
Gurguntius the sonne of Belin king of Britaine, as he returned with great triumph
from out of Denmarke, he met at the Iles of the Orchades a nauie (1) of a certeine
nation or people, named Baldenses, now Baions, and those he sent into Ireland,
appointing vnto them certeine guides and leaders to conduct &amp; direct them thither.</p>
<p part="N">Likewise the same histories doo plainlie witnesse, that king Arthur, the famous
king of Britaine, had manie of the Irish kings tributarie to him: &amp; he on a time
holding &amp; kéeping his court at Westchester, Gillomarus king or monarch of
Ireland, with other the princes thereof, came &amp; presented themselues before him.
Also the Irishmen came out of (2) Baion, the chiefe citie in Biscaie. And forsomuch
as men, be they neuer so frée, yet they maie renounce their right and libertie, and
bring themselues into subiection: so it is apparent that the princes of Ireland did
fréelie, and of their owne accord, submit &amp; yéeld themselues to king Henrie of
England, &amp; swore vnto him faith and loialtie. And albeit such men of a kind of a
naturall lightnesse and inconstancie, be not ashamed nor afraied to denie and renounce
their faith: yet that can not so release and discharge them. Euerie man is
at his owne choise and libertie how to contract and bargaine with anie one, but the
same once made he can not fléet nor swarue from it. And finallie the holie pope, in
whom is the effect of perfection, and who by a certeine prerogatiue and title
requireth &amp; claimeth all Ilands, bicause by him and by him and by his meanes
they were first reduced and recouered to the christian faith; he I saie hath ratified
and confirmed this title.</p>
<p part="N">(1) The historie is this, that Gurguntius the son of king Belin made a viage into
Denmarke, there to appease the people, who were then vp in rebellion against him:
and hauing preuailed and ouercommed them, he in his returning homewards by
the Iles of the Orchades; there met him a fléet or a nauie of thirtie or (as some

it is a part of the countrie of Gascoigne, whose capteine named (as some write)
Bartholomew, did present himselfe before Gurguntius, and discoursing vnto him
the cause of their trauels, besought him to consider of their distresse, and to grant
vnto them some dwelling place, and they would béecome his subiects. Which
their request the king granted, and taking their oth of allegiance sent and caused
them to be conducted into Ireland, where as his subiects they remained and
continued.</p>
<p part="N">(2) These people were named Iberi, &amp; before that they came to seeke vnto
Gurguntius for a land to dwell in, they dwelled in that part of Spaile, whereof
Baion is the metropole, which is now part of Biscaie, and this countrie before and

And to make this the more probable, and himselfe of more credit, he aduertiseth
that Reimond had placed and appointed garrisons for the purpose; and had sworne

The king therefore after the winter following, sent ouer foure of his seruants in

messengers came from the garrison at Limerike, aduertising that Donold prince of
Thomond had besieged the citie round about with a great armie, and that their
vittels which they had in the towne, aswell that which they found at their comming
thither, as also what so euer was else prouided, were all spent and consumed;
and therefore requested that they might with all spéed be rescued and holpen. The
earle, who was verie sorie &amp; pensife for these newes, and deuising all the waies he

so greeued for the going awaie and departure of Reimond, that they vtterlie denied

foorth toward Limerike, hauing with him foure score gentlemen of seruice, two
hundred horsmen, &amp; thrée hundred archers, besides Morogh of Kencile, and
Donold of Ossorie, and certeine other Irishmen, who serued and attended him.
And as he was marching and comming toward Cashill, tiding was brought him

of it selfe it were verie strong, yet by means of new trenching, plashing

warmed with the same, suddenlie like a hurling and a blustering wind entered into
the passe, pulled downe the fastnesse, and brake downe the hedges, and so made
waie, with no small slaughter of the enimies, whereby the passe was recouered and
the enimies ouercome. And they then marched without perill vnto Limerike,
where they entered the third daie in the Easter wéeke, being on tuesdaie. And as
the first conquest of Limerike was vpon a tuesdaie, so was the second also, where
for a time they staied, and restored all things by the enimies before spoiled, &amp; set
the same in good order. The enimies finding themselues to be too weake, and
that it was better to bow than to breake, practise to haue a parlée and a communication
with Reinmond: &amp; in the end the messengers of Rothorike king of Connagh,
and of Donold of Thomond, did obteine the same; and a parlée was appointed
for them both, which was in one daie, but not in one place; for Rothorike
of Connagh came by boates vpon the riuer of Shenin, as far as the great logh of
Dirigid, &amp; there staied. And Donold not far from thense kept himselfe and his
companie in a certeine wood. But Reimond chose a place not far from Killaloo,
which is about seauentéene miles from Limerike, and in the midle betwéene
them both. The parlée betweene these continued a pretie while, but in the end
both kings submitted &amp; yéelded themselues, gaue hostages, made fealtie, and were
sworne to be true from thensefoorth for euer, to the king of England and to his
heires.</p>
<p part="N">These things thus doone and concluded, Reimond returneth in great triumph
and iolitie vnto Limerike. And by and by there came messengers vnto him from
Dermon Mac Artie prince of Desmond, praieng and requesting him to aid and helpe
him, being the king of Englands faithfull and leige man against his eldest sonne
Cormon Olechan, who went about to driue and expell him out of his land and
dominion: &amp; promised him good interteinment both for himselfe and for his souldiors
for the same. Reimond nothingi refusing the offer, and verie desirous of honor,
taketh aduise of his fréends and companions; and by all their consents, the iorneie
towards Corke was liked. Wherevpon Reimoud displaieth his banner, and marcheth
thitherwards, and taketh by the waie great preies and booties of neat, cattell, and
other things: of the cattels he sent a good portion backe vnto Limerike for vittelling
of that citie; &amp; in the end he conquered the whole countrie, subdued the
rebellious sonne, and restored Dermon the prince to his etate and right. And
thus by reason of Reimond Mac Artie, he was restored and recouered, who otherwise
had beene in vtter despaire, and out of all remedie. And now to recompense
his son Rormach, who before this, by waie of a peace and an intreatie, both vniustlie

that my great cheeketooth, which was woont to ake so much, is now fallen out;
wherefore if yée haue anie care or regard of me, or of your selfe, come awaie
with all spéed." Reimond hauing considered of this letter, did by the falling of the
tooth fullie coniecture the death of the earle, for he laie verie sicke at Dublin before
his comming awaie from thense. But he being thus deceased, which was about the
kalends of Iune, they at Dublin did what they could to kéepe the same secret, for
feare and in doubt of the Irishmen, vntill that Reimond were come with his band
of souldiers vnto them. Reimond himselfe foorthwith returned vnto Limerike:
and notwithstanding he were verie sorrie and much gréeued with this nowes, yet
dissembling the same, and bearing it out with a good countenance, would not nor
did vtter or disclose it to anie bodie, sauing to a few wise and discréet men of his
familiars and trustie councellors. And then vpon good aduise and deliberation had
among them, it was concluded and agréed vpon, that forsomuch as the earle was
dead, and that Reimond also was to depart awaie ouer into England; that tlhe citie
of Limerike which was so farre remoted and in the midlle of manie enimies, should
for the time be left, and the garrison to be conducted and brought from thense into
Leinster, for the defense and safe keeping of the townes and forts vpon the sea
coasts. There Reimond full much against his will yéelded to this their aduise and
counsell, being much gréeued that hauing taken paines to recouer the citie of Limerike,
he was now neither able to kéepe it himselfe, nor yet had any to leue behind
him, who would take charge vpon him. But at length he sent for Donald prince
of Thomoud, being the kings baron &amp; sworne subiect, and vnto him he committed
the custodie and charge of the citie: who foorthwith pretending all truth and fidelitie
was contented therewith; and did not onelie put in hostages, but also tooke
a corporall oth, and was solemnlie sworne for the safe keeping and the restitution
ot the same at the kings will and pleasure, as also in the meane time to kéepe the
peace.</p>
<p part="N">Then Reimond and all his companie departed and went awaie: but they had not
so soone passed ouer the one end of the bridge, but that the other end was forthwith
broken downe, euen at their heeles; and the citie which was well walled, defended
and vittelled, was set on fire in foure sundrie parts, which they saw and
beheld with no small greefe of mind. The false traitor then openlie shewing and
teaching what credit was to be giuen thenseforth to the Irish nation, who so wickedlie,
impudentlie, and perfidiouslie did periure themselues. The king of England
not long after, being aduertised héereof, is said to haue thus said: "Noble was
the enterprise in the giuing of the first aduenture vpon the citie, but greater was
the rescuing and recouering thereof againe: but it was onelie wisedome, when they
left and fotsooke it." Reimond then returned vnto Dublin with his whole garrison
in safetie, and then the erle, whose corps by his commandement was reserued vntill
Reimonds comming, was buried in the church of the Trinitie at Dublin, before
the rood there, by the appointment of Laurence the archbishop, who did execute
all the funerall seruices and obsequies.</p>

For whie, he was a verie graue &amp; a valiant man, &amp; who for his constancie, truth,
courtesie &amp; loue left not his like behind. After his death, William Fitzaldelme
sent for the sonnes of the said Maurice, and so dealt with them, that he neuer left
them, vntill by one means or other he had craftilie gotten from them the castell
of Guendoke. Howbeit afterwards he gaue them Fernes in exchangee: which albeit
it were in the middle of their enimies, yet like lustie and couragious gentlemen,
they builded there a strong castell, which they kept &amp; inhabited maugre all their
enimies. Walter Almane, so called in name, and not for that lie was ether in nature
or stature an Almane, being nephue to William Fitzaldelme, was made seneschall
of Wexford; who nothing degenerated from the maners &amp; conditions of his
vncle, but was one who was a corrupt man in all his actions &amp; dooings, being couetous,
proud, malicious and enuious. And suerlie it is commonlie séene, that
there is none lightlie woorse, than when a beggerlie rascall from nothing, and from
a base estate, is aduanced to wealth, credit and estimation. For such a one alwaies
doubting and mistrusting all things, suppresseth all things, &amp; thinking all
things to be lawfull for him to doo, vseth all extremities at his will and pleasure.
There cannot be (I saie) a woorse beast, than when a cruell rascall and proud begger
is raised to estate, and made a ruler ouer his betters.</p>

of Reimond, and all his foresaid coosins and kinsmen. And to begin the
execution of their practises, the foresaid William first tooke awaie from Reimond
all his lands about Dublin, and about Wexford. And whereas he receiued letters
of commandement from the king, to restore vnto Fitzstephans a cantred of land
which he had in Ophelan, he being well bribed, detracted and lingered the execution
thereof: but yet in the end appointed and assigned vnto them other places
which were further off and remoted; and the same the more perillous, because they

this instant two houses aduanced to the titles of earledorns, and sundrie to the
estates of barons. And so long as they continued in the steps of their ancestors,
they were not so honourable as terrible to the Irish nation: but when they leauing
English gouernment, liked the loose life of that viperous nation, then they brought
in coine and linerie, and a number of manie other Irish and diuelish impositions,

Fitzaldelme, when he saw the course and maner of his dealings, who as he was couetous,
and did nothing but for monie; so was he timerous, and did all things in
craft and deceit: as also that the enimie feared him not, and the good subiect
loued him not. And considering also that the souldiers and garrison at Dublin,
by means of their capteins couetousnesse were vnpaid of their wages, and by reason
of his slouth and sluggishnesse the vittels waxed scant, &amp; none went &amp; scouted
anie more abrode as they were woont to get anie booties or preies, he secretlie dealeth
with some of them, and by his wise conference, and wittie persuasions, allureth
and intiseth vnto him euen such as were the valiantest, honestest, and chosen men
of them all: who were content and verie glad to accompanie and follow him. And
hauing so gotten into his companie two and twentie gentlemen, and about three
hundred others, he boldlie entreth and inuadeth into the prouince of Vlster, a
countrie which hitherto had not tried the force and strength of the English nation.
And then was fulfilled the prophesie of Merlin Celodine (as is said, howbeit I will
<note place="marg" anchored="false">A prophesie of Merlin fulfilled.</note>

his shield, shall be the first which with force of armes shall enter and inuade
Vlster."</p>
<p part="N">This Iohn Courcie was somewhat of a browne colour, but therewith somewhat
whitish, and at that time he rode vpon a white horsse, as also did beare in his shield
three painted (1) birds. After that he had passed three daies iourneie through the
countrie of Vriell, he came the fourth daie (being the kalends of Februarie) to
the citie of (2) Downe, without anie resistance of the inhabitants thereof: he being
an enimie and a ghest vnlooked for. And (3) Odonell then the ruler of that countrie,
being astonied and amazed at their so sudden conmming, fled awaie. The
souldiers which before their comming from Dublin were halfe pined with famine,
and hunger starued, hauing now recouered great booties and preies of neat and

commeth to enter &amp; breake into the citie of Downe. For in Ireland, as it is commonlie
also in all other lands, they which inhabit in the north, are more warlike
and cruell than anie others in other parts. Iohn Courcie séeing the course and
bent of the enimies, who not onelie vpon a hope and confidence of their great
multitude against so few enimies; but also their valiant and couragious minds, who
were fullie determined to inuade the citie: thought it better with his small companie
(which though they were but few in respect of their aduersaries, yet they
were souldiors valiant, coragious, and of good seruice) to issue out and aduenture
the fight with them, than to be pinned &amp; shut vp in a beggerlie ward made with
turffes in a corner of the citie, and there for want of vittels to be famished. Wherefore
he issued out and ioined the battell with them, where the fight was hot, the
bowes a farre off on the one side, and the darts on the other side: then lance against
lance, and the bill against the spar, and the sword against the skeine: who buckled
so lustilie the one against the other, that manie a man fell that daie to the dust.
And in this terrible fight and buckling, he that had séene how valiantlie each man
shewed himselfe, and speciallie how Iohn Courcie most valiantlie with the stroke
of his sword mangled manie a man, killing some, but wounded and maimed manie,
would and must néeds haue commended him for a right woorthie, noble, and right
valiant warrior.</p>

slaine in the field, as also vpon the woars of the seas as they were fléeing and running
awaie. Then was fulfilled the old prophesie of Celodine the Irish prophet,
<note place="marg" anchored="false">A prophesie of Celodine fulfilled.</note>
who forespeaking of this battell said, that there should be such a great bloudshed
therein of the Irish people, that the enimies perceiuing them should wade vp to the
knees in bloud. Which thing came so to passe; for the Englishmen perceiuing
them and killing them vpon the woars, the same were so soft, that with the weight
of their bodies they sunke downe vp to the hard knées or twisels, and so the bloud
fléeting and lieng vpon the woars, they were said to be therein vp to the knées.</p>
<p part="N">The same man also (as is said) did write that a poore stranger, and one come out
from other countries, should with a small power come to the citie of Downe, and
against the will of the gouernor thereof should take the same. Manie other things
also he wrote of sundrie battels to be waged, and of the euents thereof; which
were all fulfilled in Iohn de Courcie. This booke the said Iohn had, and he so
esteemed the same, that still he had it about him, and in his hands; and did manie
times, yea and for the most part direct his dooings by the same. It was also written
in the same booke, that a yoong man with force and armes should breake and
enter in through the wals of Waterford, and conquer the same with the great
slaughter of the townsmen: moreouer, that the same man should come to Wexford,
&amp; from thense to Dublin, where he should enter in without anie great resistance;
&amp; all these things (as is apparant) were fulfilled in earle Richard. Likewise
he wrote in the same booke, that the citie of Limerike should be twise left and
forsaken by the Englishmen: but the third time it should be kept, which thing
came so to passe. For first (as is before written) Reimond had it and gaue it ouer:
the second was, when the king had giuen the same to Philip de Bruse, for he being
brought thither ly Fitzstephans, and Miles Cogan, to take and enter into the same,
and being come to the riuer side of Shenin for the same purpose, was there vtterlie
discoraged to procéed anie further, and so without anie thing doone, leaueth the
same as he found it, and came backe againe; as hereafter in his place it shall
be shewed. And thus (according to this vaticine) twise it was left, but the third
time it shall be kept.</p>
<p part="N">But this is to be implied and meant of Hamon de Valognies the iusticiarie there
appointed; in whose time the said citie being vnder lis gouernment, was by treacherie
and treason destroied, and so forsaken and left; but afterwards recouered
by Meilerius: euer since which time it hath remained and béene kept in the possession
of the Englishmen. Well then to the battels of Iohn de Courcie, first he
had the victorie in two notable battels or fights at Dublin; the one in Februarie,
and the other in Iulie: in which he hauing but a small companie of men, fought
against fifteene hundred of his enimies, of whome he slue and ouerthrew a great
number, and had the victorie. The third was at Ferlie about the taking of a preie,
where by reason of the streict &amp; narrow passes, he was too much and euerie eftsoones
ouerset by the enimies, and so had the wAoorse; some of his men being killed, and
some scattered and dispersed abroad in the woods and fields, so that he had scant
eleuen persons left with him. And notwithstanding that he had thus lost his men
and horsses, yet was he of such a valiant mind and courage, tlat with those few
which were left, he went through his enimies, and in spite of them all trauelled
two daies and two nights on foot in their armour without meat or drinke thirtie long
miles, vntill he was past danger, &amp; so came safelie vnto his owne castell againe.
The fourth battell was at Vriell, where manie of his men were killed and manie fled.
The fift was at the bridge of Yuor, after and vpon his comming from out of England,
and yet therein he had the victorie and conquest. So in three battels he
had the victorie, but in two he receiued both the losse and hurt; and yet in them
did more annoie the enimie, than was hurted himselfe.</p>

<p part="N">THIS Iohn de Courcie was white and pale of colour, but verie fierce and arrogant,
he was sinowous and a verie strong made man, verie tall and mightie, and
of a singular audacitie: and being from his verie youth bent to the wars proued a
verie valiant souldior. He would be the first in the field and formost in the fight;
and so ambitious and desirous he was of honor, that were the enterprise neuer so
perillous, and the seruice neuer so dangerous, yet he would giue the aduenture.
And albeit he were the generall or capteine, yet setting the prioritie thereof apart,
he would be as a common souldior, and serue in the place of a priuat seruitor; and
nmane times being more rash than wise, and more hastie than circumspect, he had
the woorst side and lost thie victorie. And although in seruice he were thus forward,
earnest, and vehement; yet in time of peace and rest he was verie sober, modest,
and altogitller giuen and disposed to serue God, and hauing the victorie of his

and be thankefull for the same. But as Tullius writeth, nature neuer made anie

through his too much pinching and sparing, and by reason he was verie vncerteine

verie much imperished and blemished. He maried the daughter of

sundrie times with his enimies, he at length had the masterie and conquest ouer

than to dwell in the middle of his enimies in continuall perill and danger. And it is
not to be much maruelled that in this iourneie he had so euill successe: for whie
he had gathered &amp; reteined to him the notablest murtherers, théeues, &amp; seditious
persons that were in all Southwales, and the marches of the same, and these were of
best credit with him, and he most ruled by them.</p>
<p part="N">About this time Amere duke Fitzstephans son, a lustie yoong gentleman and a
towardlie, died at Corke in March, to the great sorrow and gréefe of all his fréends.
Neere about this time was found and seene a great tode at Waterford, wherof was
made much woondering, as is in our topographie declared. Also within the space of
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Thrée eclipses of the sun in three yeres.</note>
thrée yeares there was seene thrée eclipses of the sun, howbeit these were not
vniuersall, but particular eclipses scene onelie in the land. After that Fitzstephans
and Miles Cogan had quietlie and peaceablie gouerned and ruled the kingdome of
Desmond fiue yéeres togither, and by their prudence and modestie had restrained the
hastie forwardnesse, and rash disposition of their yoong men, Miles and Rafe the
sonne of Fitzstephans a lustie yong gentleman, and who had maried Miles daughter,
went toward Lisemore, there to méet &amp; to haue a parlée with Waterford men: as
they sate in the fields waiting and looking for them, one Machture with whome
they should and had appointed to haue lien at his house the next night following,
suddenlie and vnwares came stealing vpon them, and there traitorouslie slue them,
and fiue of their companie. By meanes whereof the whole countrie foorthwith was in
an vproare, insomuch that Dermon Mac Artie, and all the Irishrie in those parties,
as also the traitor Machture, were out: and denieng to be anie longer the kings loiall
subiects, made wars against Fitzstephans, who now once againe felt the course of
fortunes disposition. And these so much annoied him, that he could neuer recouer
himselfe againe, vntill that his nephue Reimond, who succéeded him in the
gouernement there, came and rescued him: yet that notwithstanding, he was neuer
his owne man, neither could he be at a perfect peace and rest.</p>
<p part="N">And by the waie this is to be noted and considered, that as the northerne men be
warlike and valiant; so are the southerne men craftie and subtill, the one seeking
honor, the other deliting in craft &amp; deceit; the one valiant, the other wilie; the one
of great courage, the other set all on treason and falshood. But to the matter.
When Reimond hard how fortune frowned vpon his vncle Fitzstephans, and what
distresse he was in, being shut vp in the citie of Corke, and his enimies assailing him
round about, forthwith assenbleth his companie, and hauing in readinesse twentie
gentlemen, and one hundred of footmen and bowmen, he taketh shipping at
Wexford, and sailing along the coasts, maketh towards Corke with all the hast he
can, that he might relieue and comfort his friends, and be a terror vnto his enimies.
And in the end hauing ofttimes incountered with the enimies, some he killed, some
he droue out of the countrie, and some he compelled (which was the greater number)
to submit themselues and to sue for peace: and thus in the end after great stormes and
tempest followed a faire wether and a calme. Verie shortlie after Richard of Cogan,

brother vnto Miles, &amp; nothing inferior vnto him in valiantnesse, or anie other respect:
came into Ireland with a iollie picked companie and chosen men, being sent to the
king to supplie his brothers roome. Also in the end of the same winter, and in the
moneth of Februarie (3) Philip Barrie nephue to Fitzstephans, a verie honest and a
wise gentleman, came ouer with a lustie companie of chosen men, as well for the
aid of his vncle, as also for the recouerie of his land in Olethan, which was perforce
taken awaie (4) from Fitzstephans, as also afterwards from Rafe Fitzstephans sonne.
In the same passage also came Gerald an other nephue of Fitzstephans, and
brother vnto vnto Philip Barrie, who with his good aduise and counsell did verie
much pleasure and helpe both his vncle and brother: for he was learned and a
great traueller, in searching to learne the site and nature of that land, as also the
first origine of that nation, and whose name the title of the booke beareth. About
this time Herrie of Mont Moris professed himselfe a moonke in the monasterie of
the Trinitie in Canturburie, and gaue to the same in franke and pure almes all his
patronages and impropriations of all his churches, lieng by the sea coasts betwéene
Waterford &amp; Wexford, and so became a moonke, &amp; liued a solitarie life in a
religious habit: who as he changed his habit, so would God he had changed his
mind! &amp; as he hath laid awaie his secular weeds, had cast off his malicious
disposition!</p>
<p part="N">(1) The gift which the king gaue vnto these two gentlemen of this countrie is
yet extant vnder his broad seale, and was giuen by the name of the kingdome of
Corke, being bounded from the riuer which fléeteth by Lisemore towards the citie
of Limerike, vnto Knocke Brendon vpon the seas on the west, to be holden of the
king, and of his heires by thrée score knights fées. The citie it selfe without
cantred of land was reserued to the king, sauing that they two had the custodie
thereof. This kingdome in course of time for want of heires male of them, came
to two daughters. The one of theim was married to Carew and the other to
Courcie, &amp; they in the right of their wiues inioied the same during their lines;
and after them their heires, vntill such time as by a diuision growing amongest the
Englishmen, the Irishrie expelled them, and recouered the countrie vnto themselues.</p>
<p part="N">(2) These Mac Arties are yet remaining in the said prouince of Corke, and they
be now dispersed into sundrie families, but the chiefest of them is named Mac
Artie More, and he in the tinie of king Henrie the eight was aduanced to the honor
and degree of an earle, being called the earle Clan Artie, which in common speech
by interposition of the letter C is pronounced Clancartie.</p>
<p part="N">(3) In this point there is a varietie among the writers, some writing that
Fitzstephans should take amaie the land from Philip Barrie, and giue it to his son
Rafe; and to recouer this out of their hands, the said Philip came ouer with such
power and force as he could make. Some write againe that the land after that it
was giuen to Philip Barrie, he departing into England left it in the custodie and
charge of Robert Fitzstephans, who when he listed not or could not keepe it anie
longer, deliuered the custodie thereof to his sonne Rafe: who as his father so was
he wearie to kéepe the same. And for that cause Philip Barrie minding to inioie,
and to make the best therof, with such force and helpe as he had gotten, came
ouer both to helpe his vncle, &amp; also to fortifie &amp; build holds &amp; castels vpon his said
land, whereby he might be the better able to defend and kéepe the same: and this
séemeth to be the truth of the historie.</p>

<head>How Hugh de Lacie builded castels, and fortified in Leinster and Meth.</head>
<p part="N">WHILEST these things were thus a dooing in Desmond, Hugh de Lacie a good
and a wise man buildeth sundrie castels both in Leinster and Meth, and fortifieth the
same verie stronglie: and among others he builded one at (1) Leighlin vpon the riuer
of (2) Barrow besids Ossorie, a place naturallie of it selfe verie strong, which place
Robert Powre by the kings commandement had the charge of, vntill he gaue the same
ouer and forsooke it. O what worthie champions ahd fit marchmen were this
Powre &amp; Fitzaldelme, to be sent to dwell and rule in a nation, which is destituted
and wanteth noble and valiant men! But a man male sée the course of fortune, who
when she is disposed to smile, how she aduanceth and raiseth vp men from base estate
to high degrées: for why, these two had more pleasure in chambering and plaieng
the wantons with yoong girls, and to plaie vpon a harpe than to beare a shield or
staffe, or to weare armour. And trulie it was to be maruelled, that so noble a prince
could send such cowards to beare rule, and haue authoritie in places of seruice. But
to the matter. Hugh de Lacie being a verie wise man, all his care was to bring all
things to a peace and quietnesse: and therefore such as were oppressed or driuen out of
their lands and territories, he restored them, and with such courteous behauiour and
gentle spéeches he dealt with all men, that in a verie short time he dreaw vnto him
the hearts of the people, who desirous to dwell vnder his gouernment, manured the
grounds; which being then wast and vntilled, was in short space full stored and
fraughted both with corne and cattell. And then for the safetie of the people and
defense of the countrie, he builded townes and erected castels in euerie place,
made orders &amp; established lawes for the gouerment of the people. And by this
it came to passe, that ech man inioied the labours of his owne hands, and euerie
man lined in peace one with the other, and euerie bodie loued him, and he assured
of all men. But hauing thus by his wisedomt, policie, and good gouernement
recouered that nation to good conformitie and obedience, behold enuie (which
alwaies maligneth vertue) he was had in a gealousie and suspicion, that his drift and
policie was to appropriat the whole land to himselfe, and as the lawfull king and
monarch would crowne himselfe king of Ireland. Which opinion was so receiued
&amp; false rumour so spred, that it was in a short time caried into England; which
when it came to the kings cares, you maie not thinke that he at all liked thereof

being dwelling there, some one of them builded a religious house of Greie friers
neere adioining to the said castell, which being since dissolued in king Henrie the
eights time, the same fell into the kings hands, who made thereof a fort, and kept
there a perpetuall garison, and thus was it disseuered froml the baronie. There is

<head>The description of Hugh de Lacie.</head>
<p part="N">IF you will know what manner of man Hugh de Lacie was, you shall vnderstand
his eies were blacke and déepe, and his nose somewhat flat, and the right side of his
face from the chin vpwards by a mischance was sllrewdlie skalled: his necke was
short, and his bodie hairie, as also not fleshie but sinewish and strong compact;
his stature was but small, and his proportion deformed, but in conditions he was
verie sober, trustie, and modest. He was verie carefull in his owne priuat matters,
but in causes of gouernment and in all publike affaires he was most vigilant and
carefull. And albeit he were a verie good souldier, and one of great experience in
martiall affaires; yet in his sundrie aduentures wherin he was sometimes rash and
verie hastie, he sped not alwaies best nor had the best successe, After the death
of his wife he was somewhat lose of life, being much giuen to women, of whom he
made no great choise: he was verie gréedie and couetous of wealth and possessions,
but ouermuch ambitious of honour and reputation. At this time in Leinster
florished Robert Fitzhenrie brother vnto (1) Meilerius, who in his youthfull yeares
was verie lustie like the flower of the garden, which when the winter draweth and
is cold, dooth vade and wither awaie. Likewise (2) Alexander and Giraldus the
two sonnes of Maurice. And albeit Girald were a man but of meane stature,
yet verie wise, sober, and honest. Also Roger le Powre conestable of Leighlin,
Hugh de Lacie, and William le Powre seneschall of Waterford, Robert Barrie the
yoonger sonne of Philip Barrie, and both the Reimonds were of best fame and
credit in these daies. About this time befell and happened the two strange
woonders at Fother in Meth, whereof we haue spoken in our topographie; namelie,
of the woman violentlie and perforce abused in a mill by a souldier, and of the

<head>How Hugh de Lacie vpon a vaine suspicion was sent for into England, and of his returne againe from thense.</head>
<p part="N">THE suspicion conceiued of Hugh de Lacie dailie increased more &amp; more, and
as is before said came to the kings eares, who as princes in such causes was verie
gelous, and could not like thereof, and therefore foorthwith sent for Hugh de
Lacie by John conestable of Chester and Richard Pet, whome he appointed to tarrie
and serue in his place, &amp; to be the gouernors or lords iustices of the land. But
before he should depart and go awaie, it was agréed by a common consent, that
there should diuerse castels and sundrie forts be builded in Leinster: for Meth was
alredie méetlie well and indifferentlie fortified &amp; incastelled. First therefore they
builded two castels in Fotheret of Onolan, the one for (1) Reimond, and the other
for Griffith his brother: the third was at (2) Tresseldermont néere to Moroghs
countrie for Walter of Ridensford: the fourth for John (3) Clauill vpon the riuer
of Barrow not far from Leighlin: the fift at Collach for Iohn Herford. And as for
Kildare, whicil witli the countrie adioining was before by the earle in his life time
giuen to Meilerius, was taken from him; &amp; in exchange the countrie of (4) Lex was
giuen to him, which was a wild and sauage countrie, full of woods, passes, and bogs,
and in the middle of the enimies, as also from anie succour or rescue: howbeit not
vnfit for this such a champion of Mars and so worthie a souldier.</p>
<p part="N">These things being thus doone in the summer time, Hugh de Lacie tooke his
passage ouer to England, and made his spéedie repaire to the kings presence, where
he so wiselie and dutifullie behaued himselfe, that the king not onelie was resolued
of his truth and fidelitie, but also putting especiall confidence in him, he sent him
backe againe. And calling home the foresaid John de conestable and Richard Pet,
made him his generall and deputie of the land, and tooke assurance of him for his
truth in this behalfe: howbeit he ioined in commission with him one Robert of
Salisburie, who should in the kings behalfe be a councellor and a trustie assistant
vnto him in all his dooings. Now Hugh de Lacie being returned backe againe
into Ireland, and there settled and placed, thinketh vpon his first deuises, how to
fortifie the countrie and to kéepe it in good order. And the more castels he
builded, and the more Englishmen he did bestow and place therein, the sooner and
better did he thinke to bring the same to passe and effect. Among manie castels
therfore which he builded, he made one at Tachmeho in Lex, which he gaue to
Meilerius, as also gaue him his néece to wife; also one castell néere to Abowie
which he gaue to Robert Bigaret, and not farre from thense an other castell which
he deliuered to Thomas Fleming. And not farre from thense he builded one other
castell at the Norach on the riuer of the Barrow, which Robert Fitzrichard had:

besides in Meth he builded the castels of Dunach and of Kilaire, as also Adam
Fuceport and Gilbert Migents castels, and manie others, which were now too long
to be particularlie repeted and recited.</p>
<p part="N">And about this time was that strange talke and communication in a wood in
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Talke betwéene a priest and a woolfe.</note>
Meth, betwéene a préest and a woolfe, whereof we haue spoken in our topographie:
which thing though it may séeme verie strange &amp; most incredible, yet the same is
not to be discredited. For as S. Jerome saith, you shall find in scripture manie
strange things, &amp; which to a mans iudgement shall séeme to be nothing true at all:
and yet neuertheles they are most true. For nature cannot preuaile nor doo anie
thing against the Lord of nature: neither ought anie creature to contemne or
scorne, but rather with great reuerence and honour to consider the workes of God
his creator. Not long after this king Henrie the yoonger, the son of king Henrie
the elder, being seduced &amp; caried (the more was the pitie) by lewd and naughtie
counsels, rebelled the second time against his father, and had gotten vnto him the
most part of the best noble men in all Poitiers, &amp; the lustiest gentlemen in all
France: besides his brother Geffreie the earle of Britaine the chiefe author and
cause of this rebellion, and manie others of his confederates. But in the end, by
Gods iust iudgement and vengeance for his vnnaturall ingratitude against his father,
who though he were a verie valiant and a lustie gentleman, yet against death nothing
can helpe, and so died about June at Marels to the great sorrow of manie. And
verie shortlie after also the foresaid Geffreie, a noble and a valiant gentleman, &amp; who
for his worthinesse and prowesse might haue béene the sonne of Vlysses or Achilles,
who now reuolting the third time from his father, and rebelling against him, was by
Gods iust iudgement about the kalends of August taken out of his life, and so died.</p>
<p part="N">(1) Nesta the daughter of the great Rhesus prince of Wales had thrée husbands,
the third of them was Gerald of Windsore, and these had to their first sonne William

<p part="N">(2) Tresseldermont is a castell about a fiue miles from Catherlough, &amp; somtimes
a verie faire towne and walled round about, and bordering néere to the baronie of
Odrone. The English writers doo saie that this castell was not builded in this
Tresseldermont, but at Kilken, a castell about thrée miles from this, and both now
belonging to the earle of Kildare. But the Latine bookes, which are of eldest
writing and credit, and whom I doo herein follow, doo write it by expresse words,
Tresseldermont.</p>
<p part="N">(3) This castell of Clauill not far from Leighlin, is supposed to be that which is
now called Carlough or Catlerlough: howbeit the common fame of the countrie
dooth attribute this castell of Carlough to Eua the earls wife, and the ladie and
heire of Leinster, and that she should build the same. But there appeereth no such
things of hir doings, for by the course of the historie it is plaine, that the castels
builded in Leinster were doone by the Englishmen onelie, and for their defense
and safetie.</p>
<p part="N">(4) The countrie of Lex is parcell of Leinster, &amp; lieth in the marches and
extreame confines of the same by the west: it is verie strong and fast, being full of
woods and bogs, and therefore a safe receptacle for rebels and outlawes. It is
within the diocesse of Leighlin, and before now of late no shire ground, but
inhabited by the Mores, who were alwaies rebels and traitors. But in hope to
reforme, the same it was made a countie of it selfe, by an act of parlement in the
third and fourth yeares of Philip and Marie, and named the Queenes countie.</p>

<p part="N">(2) In Ireland there are foure archbishoprikes, one at Dublin for the prouince of
Leinster, another at Cashill for the prouince of Mounster, the third at Thomond for
the prouince of Connagh, &amp; the fourth at Armagh for the prouince of Vlster. The
chiefest of them is the archbishop of this Armagh, for although euerie one of the
others be named a primat of Ireland, yet this one alone is named primat of all Ireland;
which title he hath part he bicause he is successour to S. Patrike, who first connerted
Ireland to the christian faith, and had his see and church at this Armagh; one other
cause is bicause this archbishop was the first that receiued a pall from the pope. This
pall is a certeine inuesture of cloth, which the pope haloweth and giueth or sendeth

to euerie archbishop, who weareth the same6 vppermost vpon his garment. The
nature of this pall, of the first inuention thereof and the causes whie it is giuen to
euerie archbislop, is not incident nor apperteining to the course and nature of this
historie, and therfore I will omit it. This Armagh was somtimes a faire towne, and
therein a faire cathedrall church, lieng farre and remote from all good neighbors, and
in the middle of the Onels and other sauage people; the same hath beene and still is
and lieth wast: and the archbishop remooued to a house of his named Terseekam,
which lieth néere the towne of Drogheda, being a place of better satetie.</p>
<p part="N">(3) The historie is, that this Philip of Worcester being well landed with great
riches exacted from the cleargie and departed, he was no sooner out of the towne,
but that he was taken with a sudden pang, which lbr the time was so vehement, that it
was supposed he would neuer haue recouered it.</p>

an other deuise: he desireth him to giue to their aid one of his sonnes, and if none
other, yet his yoongest sonne Iohn, that the bloud descending from the Aniowes
might in a new branch raise vp the kingdome.</p>
<p part="N">Iohn himselfe, albeit he was readie to passe into Ireland giuen him by his father,
with a great armie, (prostrating himselfe at his fathers féet) desired (as they saie)
that he might be sent to Ierusalem, but he obteined it not. So the patriarch séeing
he could doo nothing, and draw no oile out of the hard stone, hée spake thus
against the king, in th'audience of manie, with a threatfull and propheticall spirit.
"O glorious king, thou hast reigned hitherto among the princes of the world with
incomparable glorie, and your princelie honour hath hitherto dailie increased to the
type of highnesse. But now doubtlesse is this triall being forsaken of God, whom
you forsake, and destitute of all heauenlie grace. From hensefoorth shall your
glorie be turned into sorrow, and your honor to reproch so long as you liue. I would
to God the king had auoided this threat by penance, like the king of Niniuie, and
had caused this sentence to be altered !"</p>
<p part="N">The holie man spake this thing thrise, first at London, then at Douer, and lastlie
at Chinon castell beyond the sea. And I would to God the patriarch lad béene a
man without that propheticall spirit, &amp; had rather spoken a lesing, that we may for
more euidence touch such things brieflie as were before spoken by that true forespeaker,
which we saw shortlie to take effect. Whereas the king reigned thirtie
and fiue yeares, thirtie years were granted him for worldlie glorie, expectation of his
conuersion, &amp; triall of his deuotion; but the last fiue years fell vpon him, as vpon
an vngratefull, reprobate, and abiect seruant, in reuengement, sorrow, &amp; ignonlinie.
For in the two and thirtith yeare of his reigne, immediatlie after the comming of
the patriarch, his first enterprise of sending his sonne Iohn into Ireland, both the
labour and cost was frustrate and lost. The thrée and thirtith yeare, whereas he
neuer lost land before, he lost to king Philip (being but a child) almost all Aniou.
The foure and thirtith yéere he lost the castell Rader, and welnéere all Berie. The
fiue and thirtith yeare of his reigne, and the fourth yéere after the comming of the
patriarch, not onelie king Philip of France, but his son Richard of Poitiers rising
against him, he. lost the cities of Towres and Maine, with manie castels, and himselte

<head>The discord of the kings.</head>
<p part="N">A SUDDEN discord rose betwene the kings and that (which was woorse)
betwéene the father and the earle, through the working of the old enimie, &amp; their
sinnes deseruing the same, to the great hinderance of their noble enterprise: as
though they being vnfit for it, the honor thereof was reserued for other; or perchance
according to the sentence of Gregorie: Aduersitie, which is obiected against
good vowes, is a triall of vertue, and not a signe of disproofe. Who is ignorant how
happie a thing it was that Paule was driuen into Italie, and yet he suffered shipwracke?
But the ship of his heart was safe among the surges of tle sea. Likewise
therfore as vertue is perfected in infirmitie, and gold tried in the fire: so the constancie
of faith that cannot be craized with tribulations, dooth increase more as
sinapis; and the courage of the mind is more valiant againe than troublous assaults
of fortune. O how much raiher would I, that these kings accompanied with a few
men acceptable to God, had taken vpon thein this laborious, but yet a glorious
iourneie, than to wax proud for the great wealth that they had gathered of manie
people to this end. Read ouer the whole bible, and consider these latter times, and
you shall fiud. That victorie hath béene gained, not with force and humane power,
but with Gods grace and store of vertues. For as Cassiodorus saith: "An armed
people without the Lord is vnarmed." And as Seneca saith, "Not the number of
the people, but the vertue of a few get the victorie." Of the toure before named, the
emperour Frederike, albeit he was the last croised, yet in the execution thereof he
was the first: whome therefore I account so much the more woorthie of victorie in
heauen, and glorie in earth, that he forsaking large kingdomes and his empire,
delaied not out the matter.</p></div>

woondering at somewhat. So I lifting vp mine eies to sée what the same was, I saw
a bright light breake out betwéene the thickenesse of the clouds, and the clouds
<note place="marg" anchored="false">A strange vision.</note>
being incontinentlie seuered asunder, and the lower heauen as it were being opened,
and the sight of mine eies pearsing through that window to the empeircall heauen,
there appered the court thereof in great multitude, wide open as it were to be spoiled,
all kinds of munition being bent against it. You might haue séene there a head
cut from one, an arme from another, and some striken through with arrowes,
some with lances, and some with swords. And when manie of the beholders either
for the brightnes, or terror, or pitie, had fallen flat on their faces: me thought that I
(to see the end of the matter) did view it longer than the rest. So they hauing
gotten the victorie ouer all the other, the bloudie slaues fell vpon the prince of the
heauenlie orders, sitting in his throne as he was woont to bee pictured, and drawing
him from the throne on the right had, hauing his breast naked, they thrust him
through the right side with their lances, and immediatlie there followed a terrible
voice in this maner, Woch, woch, O Holi-ghost! But whether it came frŌ heauen,
or was vttered by the people beneath, I can not tell; and so the terror of this voice
&amp; the vision awakened me.</p>
<p part="N">I call him here to witnesse, to whome all things are apparant and manifest, that
immediatlie as I sat in my bed, &amp; reuolued these things in my mind, I was in so
great an horror both of bodie and mind, for halfe an houre and more, that I feared
least I should haue fallen besides my selfe. But recoursing deuoutlie to the onlie

through Gods grace returned fullie to my selfe: yet to this daie I can neuer remember
that vision without horror. What may be more terrible to a creature than to see
his creator smitten through with weapons? What man without gréefe can abide to
sée the seruants of God, &amp; patrons of men to be murthered? Who can behold the
Lord of nature to suffer, &amp; dooth not suffer therewith? What this vision portendeth,
without preiudice to anie I will shew brieflie. He that suffered once in his owne

person for all, giueth vs to vnderstand, that he now suffereth again, but that in his
flocke. And he that by triumphing ouer the crosse, and ascending to the right
hand of his father, hath victoriouslie entered his kingdome; his enimies now go
about to depriue him of his kingdome, and subuert his church, which he gathered
vnto him by the shedding of his bloud. Therefore, as I doo suppose, this passion
did not appeare vpon the crosse, but his maiestie: as though the crosse now being
taken awaie, his enimies go about to take that glorie from him, which he got on
the crosse. Or else that his faithfull had suffered, not in the crosse, but with
weapons in that holie land, which he after so manie miracles had consecrated with
his bloud. So likewise he declared this his passion which he for his susteined, not
in the crosse, but in his maiestie: so he signified, that all the court of heauen suffered
with the like compassion, mouing his to reuengement with the shewing of so great
grtefe. As concerning that voice beginning in a barbarous language and ending
in Latine, what I thinke I will shew. Woclh, woch, in the Germane toong, is a
signe of gréefe doubled. And where that wofull mourning voice began in the
Germane toong, and ended in Latine, it maie be signified thereby, that onelie the
Almans and the Italians take this the affliction of their Lord more grieuouslie than
other nations, as their hasting declareth. God forbid that the passion or
lamentation be here vnderstood by anie slaughter of the christians and people in
this expedition.</p>

worthie man named Reinulie Glanuile, one of the K. his most priuie councell in all
weightie matters, as also cheefe iustice of England. And on wednesdaie in the Easter
weeke, the wind being at east and blowing a good gale, he tooke ship in Milford

but an euill halsoning: neuerthelesse on the next morrow about noonetide he arriued
in safetie vnto Waterford with all his companie, which were about thrée hundred
gentlemen, and of bowmen, footmen, horssemen, and others a great number. Then
was fulfilled the vaticine or prophesie of old Merlin: "A burning globe shall rise out

Iland shall flée round about the fire." And hauing spoken these words of the father,
he continueth his speech, and thus speaketh of his sonne: "And of this fire shall rise
a sparkle, for feare of which all the inhabiters of the land shall tremble and be afraid:

<p part="N">Iohn at this his first arriuall into Ireland was of the age of 12 yeres, which was
from the first arriuall of his father thirtéene yeares, of the landing of the earle
Strangbow fouretéene yeares, and from the first entrance of Robert Fitzstephans
fiftéene yeares, and the yeare of our Lord one thousand one hundred eight ie and fiue,
Lucius then Romane bishop, Frederike the emperor, and Philip the French king.
There passed ouer with the king in the same fléet manie good clerks, among whome
(3) one was speciallie commended vnto this yoong lord by his father, for that he
was a diligent searcher of naturall histories, as also had béene before two yeares in
the same land, and there collected sundrie notes, and sufficient matter as well for his
historie, as for his topographie: and which after that he was returned home, and
attending in the court, did (as leisure serued him) digest and set in good order of
a booke, the same being his labor of thrée yéeres. A trauell to him painefull, but
to his posteritie profitable, although much misliked and enuied at by such as then
were liuing: the one liked t well, but the other dispraised it; the one reaped a
benefit and commoditie, but the other of a secret malice maligning the same, fretted
in his humor, and was grauelled in his owne follie.</p>
<p part="N">(1) The first voiage of the king his sonne, being then but a child of twelue
yéeres of age: the English chronicles doo make small mention therof. But such as
doo write thereof, doo report that the king brought his sonne as farre as Glocester
on this iornie: and there dubbing and honoring him with the degree of knighthood,
sent him on his iornie.</p>
<p part="N">(2) Penbroke is an old and an ancient towne, builded by a noble man named
Arnulph Montgomerie the ancestor of the Carews, whose names are Montgomeries,
<note place="marg" anchored="false">The ancient house of the Carews.</note>
&amp; lieth in Westwales named Demetia, but now of this towne is called Penbrokeshire.
It standeth vpon a créeke of Milford hauen, about two miles from the castell Carew:
of which castell the Montgomeries builded, and there dwelling tooke the name
thereof, &amp; were called Carews, which name that familie dooth yet reteine. In this
towne of Penbroke standeth a goodlie and a strong castell, which hath béene in
times past the seat and house of manie a noble man bearing the name of the earles
of Penbroke. In this was king Henrie the seuenth borne. It is now in great
ruine and in decaie.</p>
<p part="N">(3) This man mert here is Giraldus Cambiensis the author of this booke, who (as
it appeareth by this and other his works) was learned and much giuen to studie.
He was archdeacon of saint Dauids, and descended from Girald of Windsore, and
the ladie Nesta his wife, for he was the son of Maurice, and the sonne of the foresaid
Girald and Nesta: and so this Girald of Windsore was his Proauus or great grandfather.</p>

absolued, and ended the same. And here is to be noted, that albeit both Fitzstephans
and the earle did helpe Dermon Mac Morogh to recouer his countrie of Leinster,
as also defended and kept the same from robbers, théeues, &amp; enimies: yet they did
it in diuerse respects. The one in respect of his faith and promise, the other for loue
of Eua, &amp; of the (1) inheritance, which by hir should grow and come vnto him.
But as concerning the intruding vpon Waterford, and the conquests of sundrie
territories as well in Desmond as in Meth, I can not excuse them. The earle, who
in right of his wife was lord of Leinster, the fift part or portion of Ireland, surrendred
and yéelded vp all his right and title there vnto the king himselfe, and
tooke it againe to hold of him. The like also did all the princes of the land.
Whereby as also by other old and ancient records it is apparant, that the English
nation entred not into this land by wrong and iniurie, (as some men suppose and
dreame) but vpon a good ground, right, and title.</p>
<p part="N">(1) The course of this historie in the beginning dooth plainelie declare, how that
Dermon after his departure from the king came to the citie of Bristow, and there hauing
conference with Richard Strangbow erle of Chepstow, did offer vnto him his onelie
daughter and heire in marriage, with the inheritance of all Leinster: conditionallie
that he would passe ouer into Ireland, and to helpe him to recouer his land, which
conditions were accepted and afterwards performed. Afterwards he lieng at saint
Dauids for passage, there he met with Robert Fitzstephans, &amp; did condition with
him, that if he would passe ouer into Ireland to helpe him, he would giue him the
towne of Wexford with certeine cantreds therevnto adioining, which conditions
were then accepted and afterwards performed. Thus it appeareth that the one for
loue of the gentlewoman, and the other in respect of his promise did passe ouer into
that land and realme.</p></div>

daies; you shall find it most certeine and true, that no nation, no state, no citie,
nor common-wealth was euer ouerthrowne by the enimie, nor ouercome by the
aduersarie but onelie for sinne and wickednesse. And albeit the Irish people and
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Sin the cause of ouerthrows by the enimie.</note>
nation for their sinfull and abhominable life did well deserue to be ouerthrowne and
ouerrun by strangers; yet was it not Gods will and plesure that they should vtterlie
be brought into subiection: neither was it his good will &amp; pleasure that the Englishmen,
though they had brought some of them into subiection, yet they should not
therefore haue the whole empire and entire souereigntie ouer them: for both were
sinfull people and merited not anie fauour at Gods hand, but deserued to be
seuerelie punished, and therfore neither the one (albeit he were a conqueror, and
had the ouer hand) could yet obteine a seat (2) in Pallas castell, nor yet the other
be fullie subdued &amp; broght into perfect subiection. The Irish people are said to
haue the foure men whome they account to be great prophets, and whome they haue
in great veneration and credit (3) Merlin, Bracton, Patrike, and Columkill, whose

books and prophesies they haue among themselues in their owne language, and all
they intreating and speaking of the conquest of this land, doo affirme that the same
shall be assailed with often warres, the strifes shall be continuall, and the slaughters
great. But yet they doo not assure nor warrant anie perfect or full conquest vnto
the English nation (4) not much before dooms daie. And albeit the whole land of
Ireland, from sea to sea, haue for the most part béene in the power of the Englishmen,
and by them fortified and replenished with sundrie and manie castels, though sometimes
to their perilles and smarts: yet Bracton saith, that the king who shall make the
absolute and finall conquest, shall come from out of the deserts and mounteins of
saint Patrike, and vpon a sundaie at night shall with force breake into a castell
builded in the fastnesse of Ophalie: and vntill that time the English nation shall from
time to time be in continuall troubles with the Irishrie, sauing that they shall hold
and inioie the whole land bordering vpon the east coasts of the seas.</p>
<p part="N">(1) The course of this historie dooth at full declare in particulars, how the first
aduenturers were maligned. &amp; as much as might be discredited. First Robert
Fitzstephans, whose seruice was counted notable, and his fidelitie to his prince and
king trustie and assured: yet fell he into the kings displeasure, was cast into prison,
and albeit deliuered out againe, yet the king conceiuing some gelousie of him, had
him ouer into Normandie, where he serued two yeares in his warres: and although
he were againe afterward sent ouer into Ireland, yet was he not in anie authoritie
or office. The earle Strangbow although he came ouer with the king his speciall
licence, yet his good successe was so enuied at, that the king made proclamation,
that all his subiects being in Ireland with the earle, should returne &amp; come home;
and that no vittels, no munition, nor anie reléefe should be transported out of anie
of his dominions into Ireland. And albeit the earle afterwards were reconciled to
the king, yet was he faine to yéeld vnto him all his land and dominion of Leinster
vnto the kings denotion, &amp; to receiue the same againe to be holden of the king.
Reimond who could not be charged, nor spotted with anie vntruth: yet the
treacherous Heruie with his false informations so inueigled and falselie informed the
king against him, that he was sent for home, and not trusted with anie gouernement.
Hugh de Lacie, who (as the historie saith) was the first that made waie into Vlster,
who fortified the prouince of Leinster and Meth with manie strongs holds &amp; castels,
and brought all the countrie to a peaceable state; he was suspected to haue meant
the impropriation of the whole land to his owne vse, and was dismissed of his
charge and gouernement, and sent for home: and in place and lieu of these were
sent ouer William Fitzaldelme, Philip of Chester, and others, in whome was no value

said and fained by the poets to be borne of the braine of Inpiter without anie
moother, she inuented the order of warres, and deuised the maner of fightings, she

and by diligent observations he would gesse maruellouslie at the euents of manie
things. Wherevpon he was taken for a prophesier, and reputed for a magician or
a diuinor. He was in the time of king Arthur, about the yeare fiue hundred and
thréescore, and of this Merlin it is spoken in this historie. The other Merlin was
before this man and in the time of Vortiger: about the yeare of our Lord foure
hundred and thréescore, and he was named <emph>Ambrosius Merlmus,</emph> who was also excellentlie
well learned, both in philosophie and the art magike; but his sentences

things which happened, &amp; which (for certeine causes) are not at full discoursed in
this storie, as we wished that we might haue had the oportunitie so to haue doone.
First therfore you shall vnderstand that Iohn the kings sonne at his first comming
ouer builded three castels, one at Tibrach, an other at Archeohinan, and the third at
Lisemore. Likewise three worthie gentlemen were lost and killed: namerie, Robert
Barrie at Lisemore, Reimond Fitzhugh at Outhan, and Reimond Kantune at Ossorie.
Also how Donald the prince of Limerike secretile stole vpon the earies armie in
Ossorie, as they were comming from Dublin towards Limerile, and slue foure
hundred Ostomans, and foure noble gentlemen, which were their capteines; among
whom was Ogranie an Irishman. And also Dermond Mac Artie prince of Desmond,
being at parlee with certeine men of Corke not fane from the said towne, was there
set vpon by the said Corkemen &amp; (1) Theobaid Fitzwalter, and there was he and the
most part of his companie slaine. The like happened in Meth, where they of
Kencole &amp; their capteine made a rode, and being set vpon by one William the instice
of that countrie, they were all slaine and a hundred of their heads sent vnto Dublin.
Moreouer Iohn de Courcie found the bodies of saint Patrike, saint Brigid, and saint

castell at Deruach, was there traitorouslie slaine. Iohn de Courcie at his returne
from out of Connagh lost sixtéene of his best gentlemen. Roger le Powre a valiant,
and a lustie yoong gentleman, was by treason taken and murthered in Ossorie,
wherevpon the Irishmen foorthwith brake out from their due obeisance to the king
of England, and rebelled against the Englishmen, destroied manie castels, and set
the whole realme in a great sturre and vnquietnesse. Other sundrie things happened
which were too long to recite: and therefore leauing the same, we will returne
to our historie.</p>
<p part="N">(1) This Theobald Fitzwalter, who by his nation was named Becket but by his
office Butler, was the sonne of Walter the sonne of Gilbert: &amp; was the first Butler
that came into Ireland, who being a wise and an expert man, was first sent with
William Fitzaldelme. Afterwards he was sent ouer by king Iohn to view and serch
the countrie; and in the end he grew into such credit, that he was infeoffed with
great linings there, as also aduanced (and his posteritie after him) to great honors
&amp; promotions, which now are named earles of Ormond and Ossorie.</p></div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="38">
<head>The causes why England could not make the full and finall conquest of Ireland.</head>
<p part="N">IT were not amisse, that we now did consider the causes, and declare the impediments,
why the kings sonne had not the best successe in this his so honourable
a iournie, and wherefore his so famous attempt tooke not effect: that albeit the
same can not reuoke and remedie that which is past and doone, yet that it maie
be a forewarning to that which maie follow and insue. The principall and chiefe
cause I suppose and thinke to be, bicause that whereas the patriarch of Ierusaiem
named Heraclius came in an ambassage vnto him, in the name and behalfe of all
the whole land of Palestine called the holie land, requesting that he would take
vpon him to be their helpe, and defending the same against the Saladine then king
of Egypt and of Damasco: who hauing bent his whole force against them, was
like within two yeares following vtterlie to be ouerrun, the said holie land, vnlesse
some rescue in the meane time and with expedition were prouided: he vtterlie
denied and refused the same. And being further vrged to send one of his sonnes,
although it were the yoongest: he denied that also: making no account neither
of the cause it selfe, which was Christ; nor of the people, which were christians:
neither yet of the person, which was a reuerend and honourable personage.</p>
<p part="N">And yet neuerthelesse he sent foorth his yoonger sonne in a iournie or hosting,
more sumptuous than are néedfull or profitable? And whither I praie you? Was
it into the east and against the Saracens and miscreants? No, no, it was into the
west, &amp; against his euen christian, nothing séeking the aduancing of Gods glorie,
nor promoting of his cause, but onelie for his owne priuat lucre and singular commoditie.
An other cause was this. At the first landing and entrie of the kings
sonne at Waterford, a great manie of the chiefest of the Irishmen in those parties,
and who since their first submission to king Henrie had continued faitfull and
true, they being aduertised of this his arriuall, did come and resort vnto him in
peaceable maner, and after their best order to salute him, and congratulate his
comming. But our new men &amp; Normans, who had not before béene in those parties,
making small account of them, did not onelie mocke them, and laugh them
to scorne for the manner of their apparell, as also for their long beards and great

glibs, which they did then weare and vse according to the vsage of their countrie:
but also they did hardlie deale and ill intreat manie of them. These men nothing
liking such interteinment shifted themselues out of the towne, &amp; with all hast
sped themselues home: euerie one into his owne house; &amp; from thense they with
their wines, children, and houshold, departed and went some to the prince of
Limerike, some to the prince of Corke, some to Rothorike prince of Connagh,
and some to one lord, and some to an other: and to these they declared orderlie
how they had béene at Waterford, and what they had séene there, and how they
were intreated; and how that a yoong man was come thither garded with yoong
men, and guided by the counsels of yoong men: in whom there was no staie, no
sobrietie, no stedfastnesse, no assurednesse, whereby they and their countrie might
be assured of anie safetie.</p>
<p part="N">These princes and namelie they thrée of Connagh, Corke, and Limerike, who
were the chéefest, and who were then preparing themselues in a readinesse to haue
come and saluted the kings sonne, and to haue yéelded vnto him the dutifull obeisance
of faithfull subiects: when they heard these newes, they began streightwaies
to imagine, that of such euill beginnings woorse endings would insue: and reasoning
the matter among themselues, did conclude, that if they thus at the first did
deale so discourteouslie with the humble, quiet, and peaceable men: what would
they doo to such as were mightie and stout, and who would be loth to receiue such
discourtesies at their hands? Wherefore with one consent they concluded to stand
and ioine togither against the English nation, and to their vttermost to aduenture
their liues, and to stand to the defense of their countrie and libertie. And for
the performance thereof, they enter into a new league among themselues, and
swore each one to the other, and by that means enimies before are now made fréends
and reconciled. This we know to be true, and therefore we speake it, and that
which we saw we doo boldlie witnesse. And for so much as we thus fondlie and in
our pride did abuse them, who in humblenesse came vnto vs: therefore did we well
deserue by Gods iust iudgement (who hateth the proud and high minded) to lose
the others, for by this example they were vtterlie discouraged to like of vs. And
this people and nation though it be barbarous and rude, not knowing what apperteineth
vnto honour: yet most and aboue all others doo they desire to be exalted
and honoured. And although they be not ashamed to be found false of their word,
and vniust in their dealings: yet will they greatlie discommend Feng and commend
truth, louing that in others, which is not to be found in themselues. But to the
matter. What great euils and inconueniences doo grow by such follies and insolencies,
a wise man may soone learne by the example of Renoboam the sonne of
Salomon, &amp; so by an other mans harme learne to beware of his owne. (2) For he
being lead and carried by yoong mens councels, gaue a yoong mans answer vnto
his people, saieng vnto them; "My finger is greater than was my fathers Ioins,
and whereas he beat you with rods, I will scourge you with scorpions," by reason
whereof ten tribes forsooke him for euer, and followed after Ieroboam. Another
cause is this, when Robert Fitzstephans came first ouer, and also the earle; there
were certeine Irishmen which tooke part with them, and faithfullie serued vnder
them: and these were rewarded and had giuen vnto them for recompense certeine
Iands, which they quietlie held and inioied, vntill this time of the comming ouer
of the king his sonne: for now the same were taken from them, and giuen to such
as were new come ouer, contrarie to the promise &amp; grant to them before made.
Wherevpon they forsooke vs and fled to our enimies, and became not onelie spies
vpon vs, but were also guiders and conductors of them against vs: they being so
much the more able to hurt and annoie vs, bicause they were before our familiars,
and knew all our orders and secrets. Besides this, the cities and townes vpon and

néere the seacoasts, with all such lands, reuenues, tributes, and commodities as to
the same did belong and apperteine, and which before was imploied and spent for
the defense of the commonwealth &amp; countrie, and in the seruice against the enimies,
were now all assigned and bestowed vpon such as were giuen to pilling and polling,
and who laie still within the townes, spending their whole time, and all that they
had in drunkennesse and surfetting, to the losse and damage of the good citizens
and inhabitants, and not to the annoiance of the enimies. And besides sundrie
other commodities, this was one, and a speciall one; that at the verie first entrie
of the king his sonne into this vnrulie and rebellious land, the people being barbarous,
and not knowing what it was to be a subiect, nor what apperteineth to
gouernment, such men were appointed to haue the charge, rule and gouernement,
<note place="marg" anchored="false">The inconueniences following euill gouernment.</note>
as who were more méet to talke in a parlor than to fight in the fields, better skill to
be clad in a warme gowne than to be shrowded in armor, and who knew better how
to pill and poll the good subiects than to resist and incounter the enimie: yea for
their valiantnesse and prowesse they might well be resembled vnto William Fitzaldelme,
vnder whose gouernement both Ireland and Wales were almost vtterlie destroied
&amp; lost. For whie, they were neither faithfull to their owne people nor dreadfull
to their enimies; yea they were vtterlie void of that affect, which is naturallie
ingrafted in man, which is to be pittifull to the humble and prostrate, and to resist
the proud and obstinat; but rather of the contrarie, they spoiled their owne citizens,
and winked at their enimies: for to resist and withstand them nothing was
doone, no castels nor fortresses builded, no passes for safetie made, no waies for
seruice opened, but althings went to ruine, and the common state to wracke.
Moreouer, the seruing men and the soldiers which were in garrison, they liking
well of their capteins and masters maners and loose life, gaue themselues to the like,
spending their whole time in rioting, bankering, whoredome, and all other dissolute
and wanton orders, tarrieng still within the townes and places far off from the enimies.
For as for the marches (so called bicause the same bordered vpon their enimies;
or rather of Mars, bicause in those places martiall affaires were and are
woont to be most exercised) they would not come néere the sight thereof, and by
that means the people there dwelling and seated, the soiles there manured, the
castels there builded, were altogether destroied, wasted, spoiled, and burned. And
thus the prowesse of the old capteins, the good seruices of the veterans &amp; well
experimented soldiers by the insolent, distemperat, and lewd life of these new
comes was discredited: whereof was nothing else to be awaited for but after such
calmes must néeds insue stormes and tempests. And albeit they thus lieng in the
townes in securitie and at rest, wallowing in lose and wanton life, euerie daie being
a holie daie to Bacchus and Venus: yet the state of the land at large was most
miserable and lamentable. For euerie where was howling and wéeping, the manured
fields became waste, the castels destroied, and the people murthered, and no
newes but that the vtter destruction of the whole land was at hand. And in this

more troubled with lawing within the towne, than he was in perill at large with the

faintharted, and afraid to looke vpon the enimie: and on the contrarie the enimic
most strong, stout, and bold. Thus was the land then gouerned, and thus the
same posted towards the destruction of the English nation and gouernment, which
had doubtlesse verie shortlie followed and insued, had not the king prouided a
speedie remedie for the same. For the king being aduertised how disorderlie things

framed, and considering with himselfe in what perill the state of his realme and
people stood, he with all spéed sendeth for all these new come souldiors, in whome
(other than the name of a souldior was nothing of anie value and commendation)
and commandeth them to repaire and come home, and sendeth ouer in their places
these old beaten and well tried soldiors, by whose seruice the land before had beene
conquered and kept, among whome one and the cheefest was Iohn de Courcie, who
was made lord deputie, and had the gouernement of the land committed vnto him:
who, according to his office and dutie, setteth in hand the reformation of all things
méet and requisit to be redressed: who the more valiant and forward he was in his
said affaires and seruices, the more the land grew to good order, and inioied peace
&amp; quietnesse. For whie, he would not be idle himselfe, neither would he suffer
his souldiers to lie idle like loiterers and sluggards: but was alwaies labouring and
trauelling abroad, and marching still towards the enimies, whome he followed and
pursued euen through the whole land, to the vttermost parts thereof, as well in
Corke, Thomond, Connagh, and elsewhere; and if by any means he could haue
anie aduantage of them, he would suerlie giue the onset and aduenture vpon them:
which for the most part was to their ouerthrowe, though he and his sometimes were
galled, and felt the smart. And would to God he had beene as prudent a capteine
as he was a valiant souldior; and as prouident in the one as skilfull and hardie
in the other! But to my former purpose. Among the manie and sundrie inconueniences
happened by euill gouernment of these new officers (as is before said)
there was none greater, nor more to be lamented than was this: that notwithstanding
God of his goodnesse did giue the victorie, and send the happie successe in
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Aba Giraldus! could you sée that curssed fault and abuse?</note>
this noble conquest: yet was there neither due thanks attributed vnto God, nor
anie remembrance giuen vnto his church; but to increase a further ingratitude,
they tooke and spoiled awaie from the same their lands and possessions, as also
minded to abridge them of their old and ancient priuileges &amp; liberties. Too great
a note of ingratitude, and an argument of too much vnthankfulnes: wherof what
vnquietnesse and troubles did insue, the sequele therof (for the course of sundrie
years) did shew and declare.</p>
<p part="N">So manie outrages &amp; disorders, which did créepe in by the disordred gouernement
vnder the king his sonne, were not so much to be imputed to his yoong and
tender yeares, as vnto the euill counsels and directions of such as were about him,
and had the speciall charge thereof; for such a sauage, rude, and barbarous nation
was by good counsels, discréet directions and prudent gouernement to haue béene
gouerned and reduced to good order and conformitie. For whie, if a realme which
by wise and prudent gouernement is brought and reduced to a perfect state, yet
being committed to the gouernement of a child is cursed and brought to manifold
distresses, troubles and miseries (5) how much more then is it to be so thought of
that land, which of it selfe being rude and barbarous, is committed to the gouernement
of such as be not onelie rude and barbarous, but also lewd and cuill disposed.
And that this did so happen and come to passe in Ireland, all wisemen doo
know it, and the elder sort doo confesse it to be true; although yoong men to couer
their folies, would reiect it to some other causes &amp; impediments. For whie, such
of them as had procured vnto themselues great liuings, lordships and territories,
they pretended at the first that they would be readie to serue the king his sonne,
to defend the countrie, to resist the enimie, and that they would doo this and that
with manie good morowes. But when they had gotten what they would, and had
that they sought for, then it manifestlie appeared that it was singular gaine &amp; priuat
profit which they shot at: for hauing obteined that, they neuer remembred their
oth to their lord, nor cared for the common state, nor passed for the safetie and

defense of the countrie, which in dutie they ought chiefelie to haue considered.</p>
<p part="N">(1)
The Irish nation and people euen from the beginning haue béene alwaies of
a hard bringing vp, &amp; are not onelie rude in apparell but also rough &amp; ouglie in
their bodies: their beards and heads they neuer wash, clense, nor cut, especiallie
their heads; the haire whereof they suffer to grow, sauing that some doo vse to
round it: and by reason the same is neuer kembed, it groweth fast togither, and
in processe of time it matteth so thicke and fast togither, that it is in stéed of a
hat, and kéepeth the head verie warme, &amp; also will beare off a great blow or stroke,
and this head of haire they call a glibe, and therein they haue a great pleasure.</p>
<p part="N">(2) The historie is written in the first booke of the kings the twelfe chapter,
and in the second of the chronicles the tenth chapter: the effect therof is, that
after the death of Salomon the people of Israell requested Rehoboam his sonne, to
ease them of the grieuous burdens and heauie yoke which his father laied vpon them,
who leauing the counsell of the old counsellors, gaue them answer by the aduise
of yoong heads, as in this place is recited.</p>
<p part="N">(3) What these Irishmen were, there are diuerse opinions. Some thinke that
they were such as did inhabit about Wexford, some thinke that they were they of
Kencelo, for they faithfullie serued the Englishmen vnder their capteine named
Morogh at Limerike, when the earle of Reimond recouered the same. But I find
it to be noted of the Orians, who are now dwelling within the baronie of Odron,
and had a seat there by the gift of the Kauenaughs, but since resisting against
them and denieng to paie their accustomable cheuerie, yéelded themselues vnto
the earle of Ormond, paieng vnto him a certeine blacke rent to be their defendor
against the said Keuenaughs, but in right they are tenants to the barons of
Odron.</p>
<p part="N">(4) This is meant of that which is before spoken in the twentie chapter in the
description of this Iohn de Curcie, where his too much rashnes is noted to be a
great fault in him.</p>
<p part="N">(5) It is written by the preacher, or Ecclesiastes; "Wo he vnto thee O thou
land whose king is but a child." Which is not ment absolutelie of a child, but of
such a one who (as a child) hath an euill affection, and is void of that grauitie,
wisedome, and maiestie as is required in a prince and gouernour. For Iosias when
he was crowned king of Iehuda, was but eight yeares of age; and yet bicause he
did that which was right in the sight of God, and ruled the land godlie and vprightlie,
he is commended in the scriptures for the same.</p></div>

about their lords side to serue and gard his person; they would be where they might
be full and haue plentie, they could talke and brag, sweare and stare, and standing
in their owne reputation, disdaine all others. They receiued great interteinement
and were liberallie rewarded, and left no meanes vnsought how they might
rule the rost, beare the sway, and be aduanced vnto high estate and honour. In
these things they were the first and formost, but to serue in hosting, to incounter
with the enimie, to defend the publike state, &amp; to follow anie martiall affaires,
they were the last and furthest off. And for asmuch as those noble and worthie
seruitors, by whose seruice, trauels and industrie, the said land was first entred
into and conquered, were thus had in contempt, disdaine, and suspicion, and
onelie the new comes called to counsell, and they onelie credited and honored: it
came to passe that in all their dooings they had small successe, &amp; by whole and
little their credit decaied, and nothing came to effect or perfection which they tooke
in hand.</p>
<p part="N">(1) This king, besides England and Scotland, had in his rule and gouernement
the ducllie of Normandie, and the earledomes of Gascoine, Guien, Aniou, &amp; Poitiers,
beside the losse of that which came to him by the right of his wife. And
albeit he trusted the Englishmen well inough yet being borne on the other side of
the seas, he was more affectionated to the people of those prouinces there subiect
vnto him: for of them he chose both them which were of his councell in peaceable
gouernment, as also his seruitors in martiall affaires. And albeit he had of
euerie of these prouinces some, yet bicause Normandie was the chiefest, and he
duke thereof, they went all vnder the name of Normans, and so called Normans.</p></div>

<head>How or by what manner the land of Ireland is throughlie to be conquered.</head>
<p part="N">IT is an old saieng, that euerie man in his owne art is best of credit &amp; most
to be beléeued: &amp; so in this matter they are speciallie to be credited, who haue
béene the chiefest trauellers and seruitors in and about the first recouerie of this
land, doo know and can best discouer the natures, manners, and conditions of
these people and nation: for as the matter speciallie toucheth them, so none can
doo it better than they. For whie, by reason of their continuall warres with them
being their most mortall enimies, none can better saie than they how they are either
to be conquered or vanquished. And here by the waie happie had Wales bin, I
meane that Wales which the English people doo inhabit, if the king therof in gouerning
the same or when he incountred with his enimies had vsed this deuise &amp;
policie. But to the matter. These Normans although they were verie good souldiers
and well appointed, yet the manner of the warres in France far differeth
from that which is vsed in Ireland and Wales; for the soile &amp; countrie in France is
<note place="marg" anchored="false">Great ods between the warres in France and Ireland or Wales.</note>
plaine, open, &amp; champaine; but in these parts it is rough, rockie, full of hils,

points, not onelie for their honor, but especiallie for their defense and safeties; but
to these men the same are combersome &amp; a great hinderance. In France they kéepe
standing fields &amp; trie the battels, but these men are light horssemen &amp; range alwaies
at large. In France they kéepe their prisoners and put them to ransomes,
but these chop off their heads and put them to the sword. And therefore when
the battell is to be waged in the plaine, open, &amp; champaine countrie, it behoueth

all men to be armed, some in complet harnesse, some in iackes, some in Almaine
riuets, &amp; some in brigandines &amp; shirts of maile, according to their places of seruice.
So on the contrarie, where the fight &amp; triall is in narow streicts, rockie
places, &amp; where it is full of woods &amp; bogs, &amp; in which footmen are to serue and
not horssemen, there light armor and slender harnesse will best serue. To fight
therefore in such places and against such men, as be but naked and vnarmed men,
and whome at the first push and aduenture, either the victorie must be had or lost,
light and easie armor is best and conuenient. And againe these people are verie
nimble &amp; quicke of bodie, and light of foot, and for their safetie and aduantage
they séeke waies through streicts and bogs, and therefore it is not for anie man
laden with much armor to follow and pursue them. Moreouer, the Frenchmen and
Normans most commonlie are horssemen, and doo serue on horssebacke, &amp; these
men haue their sadles so great and déepe, that they cannot at ease leape vp and
downe; and being on foot by reason of their armor, they cannot serue nor trauell.
And you shall further vnderstand, that in all the seruices and hostings, both in
Ireland &amp; in Wales, the Welsh seruitors, and especiallie such as doo dwell in the
marches, by reason of their continuall wars, they are verie valiant, bold, and of
great experiences, they can endure anie paines and trauels, they are vsed to watchings
and wardings, they can abide hunger and thirst, and know how to take aduantage
of their enimie; and their seruice by horse is such, that they are readie
to take aduantage of the field, being quicke &amp; readie to take and leape to the
horsse, as also to leaue the same, &amp; to folow the enimie at their best aduantage,
whether it be on horsse or on foot. And such kind of seruitors and souldiers were
they, which first gaue the aduenture and first preuailed in Ireland: and by such
also in the end must the same be fullie conquered, that when the battell is to be
fought &amp; waged in the plaine and champaine countrie, and against such as be
throughlie armed and appointed for the same, it is reason that the aduerse part be
likewise armed and appointed. But when the matter is to be waged in stéepe
places, rough fields, rockie hils, or in marish and boggie grounds, and against
such as be quicke of foot, and doo séeke others to tops of hils, or to bogs, and
woods: then men of the like exercise, and hauing light armour, are to be allowed.
And in the Irish wars this one thing is to be considered, that you doo in euerie wing
ioine your bowmen with your footmen and horssemen, that by them they may be
defended from the Kerns, whose nature and conditions are to run in and out, and
<note place="marg" anchored="false">The Kernes vsage in battell.</note>
with their darts are woont shrewdlie to annoie their enimies, who by the bowmen
are to be kept off. And moreouer, that the hither part of the land lieng on the east
side, or part of the Shenin which diuideth the thrée other parts from this, and this
being the fourth part must be well fortified with castels and forts: but as for Connagh
&amp; Thomond, which lie in the further side of the Shenin, and all those parties
(sauing the citie of Limerike which must needs be recouered and kept in the English
gouernement) must for a time be borne withall, and by little and little by fortifieng
of the frontiers in méet places be gotten and recouered, and so by little and
little to grow in vpon them as occasion shall serue.</p>

<head>How the Irish people being vanquished are to be gouerned.</head>
<p part="N">AS there be means and policies to be vsed in conquering this people, who are
now more light in their bodies than inconstant in mind: so when they are vanquished,
they must in an order be ruled and gouerned. First and principallie therefore
it is to be considered, that whosoeuer shall be gouernor ouer them, that he be
wise, constant, discreet, and a staied man; that in time of peace, and when they
are contented to liue vnder law and in obedience, they maie be gouerned by law,
directed by right, and ruled by iustice; as also to be stout and valiant, readie and
able with force seuerelie to punish all such as (contrarie to their dutie and allegiance)
shall either rebell and breake out, or otherwise liue in disordered maner. Moreouer,
when anie haue doone amisse, and contrarie to dutie haue rebelled, and doo yet
afterwards knowledge their follie, and yeelding themselues haue obteined pardon;
that in no wise you doo afterwards euill intreat them, neither yet laie their former
faults to their charges, neither cast them in the teeth of their follies: but hauing
taken such assurance of them as you maie, to intreat them with all courtesies and
gentlenesse, that by such good means they maie the better be induced and incouraged
to kéepe themselues within their dutie, for loue of their good gouernement
which they sée: and yet be afraid to doo euill for feare of punishment, which they
are to receiue for their euill and lewd dooings. And if they will not thus order
and gouerne them, but confound their dooings, being slacke to punish the euill,
and quicke to oppresse the good and obedient, to flatter them in their rebellions
and outrages, and to spoile them in peace; to fauor them in their treasons and treacheries,
and to oppresse them when they line in loialtie, as we haue seene manie
so to haue doone: surelie these men so disorderedlie confounding all things, they in
the end shall be confounded themselues. And bicause harms foreséene do least
annoie &amp; hurt, let them which be wise looke well, that in time of peace they doo
prepare for the warres. For after the Alcion daies and calme seas doo follow stormes
and tempests: and therefore, when they haue vacant times and leisure, let them
build and fortifie castels, cut downe and open the passes, and doo all such other
things as the nature of warres requireth to be preuented. For this people being
vncerteine, craftie, and subtill, vnder colour of peace, are woont alwaies to be studieng
and deuising of mischiefs. And also bicause it is good to be wise by another
mans harme, &amp; warie by other mens examples. For nothing dooth better teach a
<note place="marg" anchored="false">No better teachers than examples.</note>
man than examples, and the paterns of things doone afore time. Let not them for
get what became of these woorthie men, Miles of Cogan, Rafe Fitzstephans, Hugh
de Lacie, Roger Powre, and others, who when they thought of least danger they
were in most perill: and when they thought themselues in most satetie, they were
intrapped and destroied. For as we haue said in our Topographie; this people is a
craftie and a subtile people, and more to be feared when it is peace, than when it is open
warres: for their peace indéed is but enimitie, their policies but craft, their friendships
but coloured, and therefore the more to be doubted and feared. And by experience
the same in some part hath béene prooued: and therfore, as Euodius
saith, "Let the fall and ruine of things past be forewarnings of things to come."</p>
<p part="N">And bicause herein a man can not be too wise nor warie, it were good that an
order were taken (as it is in Sicilia) that none of them should weare anie weapon at
all, no not so much as a staffe in then hands to walke by. For euen with that weapon,

though it be but slender, they will (if they can) take the aduantage, and bewreake
their malice and cankered stomachs. Finallie, forsomuch as the kings of
England haue a iust title, and a full right to the land of Ireland in sundrie and
diuerse respects; and considering also that the same is chieflie mainteined by the intercourse
and traffike of merchandizes out of England; and without the same
cannot releeue and helpe it selfe; it were verie expedient that for the acknowledging
of the one, and for the inioieng of the other, as also for the supporting of the continuall
charges of the king of England there yearelie bestowed: that there be a
yearelie tribute paied and answered vnto the kings of England, either in monie, or in
such commodities as that land breedeth, aswell for the continuance of the title in
memorie, as also for the auoiding of manie inconueniences. And because time
weareth awaie, and men doo dailie perish and die, that this order for the perpetuall
honour of the king and of his realme, and the memoriall of this conquest, the
same be ingrossed and registred in a publike instrument to indure for euer. And
thus hauing spoken what we know, and witnessed what we haue séene, we doo here
end this historie, leauing vnto others of better knowledge and learning, to continue
the same as to them shall be thought most néedfull and conuenient.</p>
