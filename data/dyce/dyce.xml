                  <quote><mentioned>Appeal, v.a.</mentioned> This word appears to have been formerly
                    used with much latitude; and sometimes in such a way that it is not easy to find
                    out what those who used it precisely meant by it. But according to its most
                    ancient signification, it implies a reference by name to a charge or accusation,
                    and an offer, or challenge, to support such charge by the ordeal of single
                    combat. And something of this, its primary sense, may still be described in all
                    its various applications. Thus, an <mentioned>appeal</mentioned> from one person
                    to another, to judge and decide; or from an inferior to a superior court, is to
                    transfer the challenge from such as are deemed incompetent to accept it, to
                    those who may be competent; and, as ‘a summons to answer a charge,’ it is nearly
                    equivalent to an actual challenge. ‘And likewise there were many Southland men
                    that <mentioned>appelled </mentioned> others in Barrace to fight before the King
                    to the dead, for certain crimes of lese majesty.’</quote>
                  <bibl>Pitscottie, p. 234.</bibl>
                </cit> Here the word clearly means challenge; as in the preceding page the laird of
                Drumlanerick and the laird of Barrice are said to have provoked (which also means
                challenge[d]) others in Barrace to fight to death, ‘. . . but being
                  <mentioned>appealed</mentioned> (challenged) by the Lord Clifford, an Englishman,
                to fight with him in singular combat.’<title>Hist. of Scotland,</title> f. 365. <cit>

                  <quote>The word [<hi rend="ital">aroint</hi>] is still in common use in Cheshire;
                    and what is remarkable is, that, according to Ray, it is still coupled with a
                    witch, as ‘<hi rend="ital">rynt</hi> you, witch, quoth Besse Locket to her
                    mother,’ which is given as a Cheshire proverb; but which, as the term sounded in
                    my ears when I once heard it pronounced, I should not have hesitated to spell
                      <hi rend="ital">aroint.</hi> I have also seen it spelled, and by a Cheshire
                    man of good information, <hi rend="ital">runt;</hi> nor is it at all unlikely
                    that it is the same exclamation which in Lancashire is pronounced and spelled
                      <hi rend="ital">areawt,</hi> as equivalent to <hi rend="ital">get out</hi> or
                      <hi rend="ital">away with thee.</hi> But it is most common in the middle parts
                    of Cheshire; and there used, chiefly by milkmaids when milking. When a cow
                    happens to stand improperly, in a dirty place, or with one of her sides so near
                    a wall, a fence, a tree, or another cow, that the milker cannot readily come at
                    the udder, or to her neck, to tie her up in her boose, or stall, —in such cases,
                    the milkmaid, whilst she pushes the animal to a more convenient place, seldom
                    fails to exclaim, ‘ <hi rend="ital">Aroint</hi> thee, lovey (or bonny), <hi rend="ital">aroint</hi> thee:’ using a coarser and harsher epithet, should the
                    cow not move at the first bidding.</quote>

                      [<hi rend="ital">Aroint</hi>] is still in use there. For example, if the cow
                    presses too close to the maid who is milking her, she will give the animal a
                    push, saying at the same time ‘<hi rend="ital">'Roint thee!</hi>’ by which she
                    means ‘stand off.’ To this the cow is so well used, that even the word is often
                    sufficient.</quote>

                    piece of ground was then chosen, and divided into three compartments, of which
                    the middle one was called hell. It was the object of the couple condemned to
                    this division, to catch the others, who advanced from the two extremities; in
                    which case a change of situation took place, and hell was filled by the couple
                    who were excluded by preoccupation from the other places: in this ‘catching,’
                    however, there was some difficulty, as, by the regulations of the game, the
                    middle couple were not to separate before they had succeeded, while the others
                    might break hands whenever they found themselves hard pressed. When all had been

                  <quote>a rustic game called <hi rend="ital">base</hi> or <hi rend="ital">bars,</hi> and in some places <hi rend="ital">prisoner's bars;</hi> and as
                    the success of this pastime depends upon the agility of the candidates and their
                    skill in running, I think it may properly enough be introduced here. It was much
                    practised in former times, and some vestiges of the game are still remaining in
                    many parts of the kingdom. The first mention of this sport that I have met with
                    occurs in the Proclamations at the head of the parliamentary proceedings, early
                    in the reign of Edward the Third, where it is spoken of as a childish amusement,
                    and prohibited to be played in the avenues of the palace at Westminster, during
                    the sessions of Parliament, because of the interruption it occasioned to the
                    members and others in passing to and fro as their business required. It is also
                    spoken of by Shakespeare as a game practised by the boys [see the second of the
                    passages above cited]. It was, however, most assuredly played by the men, and
                    especially in Cheshire and other adjoining counties, where formerly it seems to
                    have been in high repute. The performance of this pastime requires two parties
                    of equal number, each of them having a base or home, as it is usually called, to
                    themselves, at the distance of about twenty or thirty yards. The players then on
                    either side taking hold of hands, extend themselves in length, and opposite to
                    each other, as far as they conveniently can, always remembering that one of them
                    must touch the base; when any one of them quits the hand of his fellow and runs
                    into the field, which is called giving the chase, he is immediately followed by
                    one of his opponents; he again is followed by a second from the former side, and
                    he by a second opponent; and so on alternately, until as many are out as choose
                    to run, every one pursuing the man he first followed, and no other; and if he
                    overtake him near enough to touch him, his party claims one toward their game,
                    and both return home. [<hi rend="ital">Note.</hi> It is to be observed, that
                    every person on either side who touches another during the chase, claims one for
                    his party, and when many are out, it frequently happens that many are touched.]
                    They then run forth again and again in like manner, until the number is
                    completed that decides the victory; this number is optional, and I am told
                    rarely exceeds twenty. About thirty years back I saw a grand match at base
                    played in the fields behind Montague-house [<hi rend="ital">Note.</hi> Now
                    better known by the name of the British Museum] by twelve gentlemen of Cheshire
                    against twelve of Derbyshire, for a considerable sum of money, which afforded
                    much entertainment to the spectators. In Essex they play this game with the
                    addition of two prisons, which are stakes driven into the ground, parallel with
                    the home boundaries, and about thirty yards from them; and every person who is
                    touched on either side in the chase is sent to one or other of these prisons,
                    where he must remain till the conclusion of the game, if not delivered
                    previously by one of his associates, and this can only be accomplished by
                    touching him, which is a difficult task, requiring the performance of the most
                    skilful players, because the prison belonging to either party is always much
                    nearer to the base of their opponents than to their own; and if the person sent
                    to relieve his confederate be touched by an antagonist before he reaches him, he
                    also becomes a prisoner, and stands in equal need of deliverance. The addition
                    of the prisons occasions a considerable degree of variety in the pastime, and is
                    frequently productive of much pleasantry.</quote>

                    is the character of a bragging cowardly knight, called Basilisco. His pretension
                    to valour is so blown and seen through, that Piston, a buffoon-servant in the
                    play, jumps upon his back, and will not disengage him till he makes Basilisco
                    swear upon his dudgeon dagger to the contents, and in the terms, he dictates to
                    him; as, for instance: <hi rend="blockquote">‘<hi rend="ital">Bas.</hi> O, I
                      swear, I swear. <lb/><hi rend="ital">Pist.</hi> By the contents of this

                    throw off that reproach by humourously laying claim to his new dignity of <hi rend="ital">knighthood,</hi> as Basilisco arrogantly insists on his title of

                  Preuention: or, The whole Arte of Fowling by Water and Land,</hi> etc.: <cit>
                  <quote>Next to the Tramell, I thinke meete to proceed to Batte-fowling, which is
                    likewise a nighty [<hi rend="ital">sic</hi>] taking of all sorts of great and
                    small Birdes which rest not on the earth, but on Shrubbes, tal Bushes, Hathorne
                    trees, and other trees, and may fitly and most conueniently be vsed in all
                    woody, rough, and bushy countries, but not in the champaine. For the manner of
                    bat-fowling, it may be vsed either with nettes or without nettes. If you vse it
                    without nettes (which indeede is the most common of the two), you shall then
                    proceede in this manner. First, there shall be one to carry the cresset of fire
                    (as was shewed for the Lowbell), then a certaine number, as two, three, or foure
                    (according to the greatnesse of your company); and these shall haue poales bound
                    with dry round wispes of hay, straw, or such like stuffe, or else bound with
                    pieces of linkes or hurdes dipt in pitch, rosen, grease, or any such like matter
                    that will blaze. Then another company shal be armed with long poales, very rough
                    and bushy at the vpper endes, of which the willow, byrche, or long hazell are
                    best; but indeed according as the country will afford, so you must be content to
                    take. Thus being prepared, and comming into the bushy or rough ground where the
                    haunts of birds are, you shall then first kindle some of your fiers, as halfe or
                    a third part, according as your prouision is, and then with your other bushy and
                    rough poales you shall beat the bushes, trees, and haunts of the birds, to
                    enforce them to rise; which done, you shall see the birds, which are raysed, to
                    flye and play about the lights and flames of the fier; for it is their nature,
                    through their amazednesse and affright at the strangenes of the lightt and the
                    extreame darknesse round about it, not to depart from it, but, as it were,
                    almost to scorch their wings in the same; so that those which haue the rough
                    bushye poales may (at their pleasures) beat them down with the same, and so take
                    them. Thus you may spend as much of the night as is darke, for longer is not
                    conuenient; and doubtlesse you shall finde much pastime and take great store of
                    birds; and in this you shall obserue all the obseruations formerly treated of in
                    the Lowbell; especially that of silence, vntill your lights be kindled, but then
                    you may vse your pleasure, for the noyse and the light when they are heard and
                    seene afarre of, they make the birds sit the faster and surer. The byrdes which
                    are commonly taken by this labour or exercise are, for the most part, the
                    rookes, ringdoues, blackebirdes, throstles, feldyfares, linnets, bulfinches, and
                    all other byrdes whatsoeuer that pearch or sit vpon small boughes or bushes.
                    This exercise, as it may be vsed in these rough, woody, and bushie places, so it
                    may also be vsed alongst quickset hedges or any other hedges or places where
                    there is any shelter for byrdes to pearch in.</quote>

                  <quote>Frequent allusions to this practice occur in the old comedies. In
                    illustration of it Mr. Ritson has given a curious story, which, as it is
                    mutilated in the authority which he has used [<title>Cabinet of Mirth,</title>
                    1674], is here subjoined from a more original source, a collection of tales,
                    etc., compiled about the time of Charles the First, pre served among the
                    Harleian Mss. in the British Museum, No. 6395. ‘The Lord North begg'd old
                    Bladwell for a foole (though he could never prove him so), and having him in his
                    custodie as a lunaticke, he carried him to a gentleman's house, one day, that
                    was his neighbour. The L. North and the gentleman retir'd awhile to private
                    discourse, and left Bladwell in the dining roome, which was hung with a faire
                    hanging. Bladwell walking up and downe, and viewing the imagerie, spyed a foole
                    at last in the hanging, and without delay drawes his knife, flyes at the foole,
                    cutts him cleane out, and layes him on the floore. My L. and the gentl. coming
                    in againe, and finding the tapestrie thus defac'd, he ask'd Bladwell what he
                    meant by such a rude uncivill act: he answered, Sr., be content, I have rather
                    done you a courtesie than a wrong, for if ever my L. N. had seene the foole
                    there, he would have begg'd him, and so you might have lost your whole suite.’

                  <quote>This mode of insult, in order to begin a quarrel, seems to have been common
                    in Shakespeare's time. Dekker, in his <hi rend="ital">Dead Term,</hi> 1608,
                    describing the various groups that daily frequented St. Paul's Church, says,
                    ‘What swearing is there, what shouldering, what justling, what jeering, what <hi rend="ital">byting of thumbs,</hi> to beget quarrels!’ [a passage originally
                    cited by <bibl>MALONE</bibl>] . . . The mode in which this
                    contemptuous action was performed is thus described by Cotgrave [<hi rend="ital">sub Nique</hi>], in a passage which has escaped the industry of all the
                    commentators: ‘Faire la nique: to mocke by nodding or lifting up of the chinne;
                    or more properly, to threaten or defie by putting the thumbe naile into the
                    mouth, and with a jerke (from the upper teeth) make it to knacke’</quote>

                  <quote>It [<hi rend="ital">blood-boltered</hi>] is a provincial term, well known
                    in Warwickshire, and probably in some other counties. When a horse, sheep, or
                    other animal, perspires much, and any of the hair or wool, in consequence of
                    such perspiration, or any redundant humour, becomes matted in tufts with grime
                    and sweat, he is said to be <mentioned>boltered;</mentioned> and whenever the
                    blood issues out, and coagulates, forming the locks into hard clotted bunches,
                    the beast is said to be <mentioned>blood-boltered</mentioned></quote>

                    (says my informant) a harness-collar to be made with a linen lining, but
                    blacked, to give it the appearance of leather. The sadler made the lining as he
                    was directed, but did not black it, saying, it would <hi rend="ital">bolter</hi>
                    the horse. Being asked what he meant by <hi rend="ital">bolter,</hi> he re
                    plied, <hi rend="ital">dirty, besmear;</hi> and that it was a common word in his
                    country. This conversation passed within eight miles of Stratford-on-Avon.’ In
                    the same neigh bourhood, when a boy has a broken head, so that his hair is
                    matted together with blood, his head is said to be <hi rend="ital">boltered</hi>
                    (pronounced <hi rend="ital">baltered</hi>). So, in Philemon Holland's
                    translation of Pliny's <hi rend="ital">Natural History,</hi> 1601, Book xii. ch.
                    xvii. p. 370: ‘they doe drop and distill the said moisture, which the shrewd and

                  <quote>The particular book here alluded to is a very ridiculous treatise of one
                    Vincentio Saviolo, entitled <title>Of Honor and Honorable Quarrels,</title> in
                    quarto, printed by Wolf, 1594, forming the Second Book of <title>Vincentio
                      Saviolo his Practise.</title> This Second Book he describes as ‘A Discourse
                    most necessarie for all Gentlemen that haue in regarde their honors, touching
                    the giuing and receiuing of the Lie, wherevpon the Duello and the Combats in
                    diuers sortes doth insue, and many other inconueniences for lack only of the
                    true knowledge of honor, and the contrarie, and the right vnderstanding of
                    wordes, which heere is plainly set downe.’ The contents of the several chapters
                    are as follow. 1. ‘A Rvle and Order concerning the Challenger and Defender.’ 2.
                    ‘What the reason is, that the partie vnto whom the Lie is giuen ought to become
                    Challenger, and of the nature of Lies.’ 3. ‘Of the manner and diuersitie of
                    Lies.’ 4. ‘Of Lies certaine.’ 5. ‘Of conditionall Lyes.’ 6. ‘Of the Lye in
                    generall.’ 7. ‘Of the Lye in particular.’ 8. ‘Of foolish Lyes.’ 9. ‘A conclusion
                    touching the Challenger and the Defender, and of the wresting and returning back
                    of the Lye or Dementie.’ In the chapter ‘Of Conditional Lies,’ speaking of the
                    particle <hi rend="ital">if,</hi> he says, ‘Conditionall Lyes be such as are
                    giuen conditionally; as if a man should saie or write these woordes,—<hi rend="ital">If</hi> thou hast saide that I haue offered my Lord abuse, thou
                    lyest; or <hi rend="ital">if</hi> thou saiest so heerafter, thou shalt lye; and
                    as often as thou hast or shalt so say, so oft do I and will I say that thou
                    doest lye. Of these kinde of Lyes giuen in this manner often arise much
                    contention in words, and diuers intricate worthy battailes, multiplying wordes
                    vpon wordes, whereof no sure conclusion can arise.’ By which he means, they
                    cannot proceed to cut one another's throats while there is an <hi rend="ital">if</hi> between. Which is the reason of Shakespeare making the Clown say, ‘I
                    knew when seven justices,’ etc. Caranza was another of these authentic authors
                    upon the Duello. Fletcher, in his last act of <hi rend="ital">Love's

                  <quote>This explanation [Ritson's] misses the peculiar force of the epithet <hi rend="ital">bottled,</hi> which is exactly equivalent to bunchbacked, and like
                    it emphasizes Richard's deformity. ‘That bottled spider,’ therefore, literally
                    means that humped or hunched venomous creature. The term <hi rend="ital">bottled</hi> is still provincially applied to the big, large-bodied,
                    round-backed spider, that in the summer and autumn spreads its web across open
                    spaces in the hedges, ‘obvious to vagrant flies.’ What, also, has escaped the
                    commentators, the word <hi rend="ital">bottle</hi> was used with this precise
                    signification for a hunch or hump in Shakespeare's own day. In a popular work
                    published a few years before he came to London, and with which he was familiar,
                    we find ‘bottles of flesh’ given as a synonym for great wens in the throat— the
                    Italian word <hi rend="ital">gozzuti</hi> being glossed in the margin as
                    follows: ‘men in the mountaynes with great <hi rend="ital">bottels</hi> of flesh
                    under their chin through the drinking of snow water.’ We still retain this
                    meaning of the word in a number of phrases and epithets, such as bottlenose, a
                    big or bunchy nose; bottlehead, provincial for great, thick, or blockhead; and,
                    not to multiply examples, in the bluebottle fly, which is literally the bunchy
                    or unwieldy blue fly.</quote>

                  <quote>The word <hi rend="ital">brawl</hi> in its signification of a dance is from

                    The following accounts [account] of this dance may be found more intelligible
                    than that cited from Marston [in his <hi rend="ital">Malcontent,</hi> act iv.
                    sc. 2]. It was performed by several persons uniting hands in a circle and giving
                    each other continual shakes, the steps changing with the tune. It usually
                    consisted of three <hi rend="ital">pas</hi> and a <hi rend="ital">pied-joint,</hi> to the time of four strokes of the bow; which being repeated
                    was termed a <hi rend="ital">double brawl.</hi> With this dance balls were

                  <quote>‘Broken music’ means what we now term ‘a string band.’ Shakespeare plays
                    with the term twice [thrice]: firstly in <hi rend="ital">Troilus and

                    were performing on stringed instruments; and secondly in <hi rend="ital">Henry
                      V.,</hi> act v. sc. 2, where he says to the French Princess Katherine, ‘Come,
                    your answer in broken music; for thy voice is music and thy English broken.’
                    [Again in <hi rend="ital">As You Like It,</hi> act i. sc. 2: ‘But is there any
                    else longs to feel this broken music in his sides?’] The term originated
                    probably from harps, lutes, and such other stringed instruments as were played
                    without a bow, not having the capability to sustain a long note to its full

                    shrub, which gives no shade, it has been doubted what is the exact meaning of
                      <hi rend="ital">broom-groves;</hi> but there are two kinds of broom, as
                    mentioned in Lyte's edition of Dodoens, 1578, p. 663, ‘the one high and tawle,
                    the other lowe and small,’ the first of which is stated to grow ‘commonly to the
                    length of a long or tawle man,’ and Parkinson enumerates several other
                    varieties. The <hi rend="ital">Spartium scoparium,</hi> which grows to a great
                    height, is probably the species alluded to by Shakespeare. There is a notice in
                    the ancient romance of Guy of Warwick, preserved in the Auchinleck Ms. at
                    Edinburgh, of three hundred Sarazens being concealed ‘in a brom field.’ See the

                    groves,’ as does Mr. Collier's annotator; and a more unhappy alteration can
                    hardly be conceived, since it at once destroys the point of the allusion: <hi rend="ital">yellow,</hi> the colour of the broom, being supposed especially
                    congenial to the <hi rend="ital">lass-lorn</hi> and <hi rend="ital">dismissed</hi> bachelor. Thus Burton, in his ‘Anatomy of Melancholy,’ Part
                    iii. Sec. 2,—‘So long as we are wooers, and may kiss and coll at our pleasure,
                    nothing is so sweet; we are in heaven, as we think; but when we are once tied,
                    and have lost our liberty, marriage is an hell: give me my <hi rend="ital">yellow hose</hi> again’</quote>

                  <quote>Is the word <hi rend="ital">grove</hi> ever applied to shrubs by the
                    Elizabethan writers? Hanmer's ‘<hi rend="ital">brown</hi> groves’ has been
                    before the public for more than a century, and has been vigorously assailed by
                    men of eminent learning and ability, but no instance of this [that is, of <hi rend="ital">grove</hi> applied to shrubs] has been produced, and therefore I
                    conclude that none exists. The notion of disconsolate lovers betaking themselves
                    to groves is common enough in poetry. Shakespeare himself has placed Romeo in a
                    sycamore grove when Rosaline was cruel, and we may judge from this the sort of
                    grove he would select for young gentlemen in the like case. Till it can be shown
                    that a growth of broom may be called a grove, it seems idle to dispute about the
                    height of the shrub. In Babington's <hi rend="ital">Botany</hi> it is said to be
                    2 1/2 or 3 feet high, and this is certainly the usual height to which it grows
                    on Hampstead Heath, though occasionally a plant may be found taller: I am told
                    that in Italy it grows to the height of 6 or 7 feet; but that surely is no great
                    matter.—The defences set up for the old reading [‘<hi rend="ital">broom</hi>-groves’] appear to me singularly weak. ‘Ceres,’ says Heath, ‘was
                    certainly not the goddess of the woods.’ Very true; and just as certainly she
                    was not the goddess of ‘broom-brakes,’ or of ‘vineyards,’ or of ‘bosky acres,’
                    or ‘turfy mountains,’ or ‘unshrubb'd downs,’ or of ‘flowers,’ or of the
                    ‘sea-marge sterile and rocky-hard;’ all which Heath has overlooked. It seems
                    that in the present masque Ceres appears as the Goddess of the Earth, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*dhmh/thr</foreign>. That this was the original character of the
                    Greek goddess is probable from the etymology of her name; but how Shakespeare
                    came so to describe her, is a question for those who have studied the subject of
                    his learning. He may have picked up a good deal of out-ofthe-way classical
                    knowledge from Jonson [?]. I think, however, we are warranted rather in asking
                    why <hi rend="ital">woods</hi> are left out in this passage than why they are
                    brought in.— Mason's quotation from the old Scotch song proves nothing as to <hi rend="ital">broom-groves,</hi> for the song merely mentions <hi rend="ital">broom.</hi> Mason accordingly is not warranted in saying that ‘the songstress
                    places her lover in a broom-<hi rend="ital">grove;</hi>’ yet Halliwell prints
                    Mason's assertion, but omits the quotation with which he supports it; so that
                    everybody who trusts to his sixty-guinea edition must necessarily believe that
                    the phrase in question occurs in the old song. As to Halliwell's 300 Saracens
                    hid in a broom field, the last word (<hi rend="ital">field</hi>) is surely
                    incompatible with groves. Besides, the same thing might happen, and indeed has
                    happened, in a field of wheat. In <hi rend="ital">The Morning Herald</hi> of 4
                    July 1861, there is an American account of 3000 rebels ‘concealed in a thick
                    undergrowth and wheat fields.’ This, however, would not warrant such a phrase as
                      <hi rend="ital">wheat-groves.</hi>—I must confess that Staunton's note with
                    the quotation from Burton's <hi rend="ital">Anatomy</hi> appears to me far more
                    unhappy than Hanmer's alteration. Shakespeare says nothing of the <hi rend="ital">blossom</hi> of the broom; he only speaks of its <hi rend="ital">shadow.</hi> Shakespeare could not have been guilty of so far-fetched an
                    allusion, and such a perversion of language. I know of no passage in which the
                    colour <hi rend="ital">yellow</hi> is represented as ‘especially congenial to
                    lass-lorn bachelors.’ Still, I am aware of several passages where yellow is
                    mentioned as the colour of <hi rend="ital">jealousy,</hi> but for the most part
                    with reference to <hi rend="ital">married</hi> people, not bachelors. I daresay,
                    however, there are similar allusions to the <hi rend="ital">jealousy</hi> of the
                    unmarried also. Jokes about <hi rend="ital">yellow hose,</hi> etc., are common
                    enough. But in this passage from Burton the phrase refers neither to jealousy
                    nor to unsuccessful love. Surely the context shows that <hi rend="ital">here</hi> ‘give me my yellow hose again’ means ‘give me my bachelor's days
                    again (when I wore <hi rend="ital">yellow hose,</hi>—which were once in high
                    fashion, and are still worn by the boys of Christ's Hospital,—and) when I was
                    kissing and colling my intended, and not satiated with a wife’</quote>

                    which great numbers of geese are bred, so that many other places in England are
                    from thence supplied with quills and feathers</quote>
                  <bibl>(HANMER)</bibl>
                </cit>. Here, therefore, there is perhaps a double allusion,—to Camelot as famous
                for its geese, and to those knights who were vanquished by the Knights of the Round
                Table being sent to Camelot to yield themselves vassals to King Arthur. <pb n="106"/>

                    particularly in the royal residences, there were a number of mean and dirty
                    dependents, whose office it was to attend the wood-yard, sculleries, etc. Of
                    these (for in the lowest deep there was a lower still) the most forlorn wretches
                    seem to have been selected to carry coals to the kitchens, halls, etc. To this
                    smutty regiment, who attended the progresses, and rode in the carts with the
                    pots and kettles, which, with every other article of furniture, were then moved
                    from palace to palace, the people, in derision, gave the name of <hi rend="ital">black</hi> guards, a term since become sufficiently familiar, and never

                observed that the word <quote>occurs in a very rare poetic tract, entitled <title>A
                    Prophecie of Cadwallader, last King of the Brittaines,</title> by William
                  Herbert, 4to, 1604, which opens with a description of Fortune, and of some who had
                  sought to gain her favour: ‘Then did this Queene her wandering coach ascend,
                  <lb/>Whose wheels were more inconstant than the wind: <lb/><lb/>
                  <lb/>A mighty troop this empress did attend; <lb/>There might you Caius Marius <hi rend="ital">carving</hi> find, <lb/>And martial Sylla courting Venus

                  <quote>Shakespeare and other dramatic writers mention a wine called
                      <mentioned>Charneco,</mentioned> which, in a pamphlet quoted by Warburton, is
                    enumerated along with Sherry-sack and Malaga (<title>The Discovery of a London
                      Monster, called the Black Dog of Newgate,</title> 1612). According to Mr.
                    Steevens, the appellation is derived from a village near Lisbon. There are, in
                    fact, two villages in that neighbourhood, which take the name of
                      <mentioned>Charneca;</mentioned> the one situated about a league and a half
                    above the town of Lisbon, the other near the coast, between Collares and
                    Carcavellos. We shall, therefore, probably not err much, if we refer the wine in
                    question to the last-mentioned territory.</quote>

                    obserued (I thinke) amongst any other women in Christendome: which is so common
                    in Venice, that no woman whatsoeuer goeth without it, either in her house or
                    abroad; a thing made of wood, and couered with leather of sundry colors, some
                    with white, some redde, some yellow. It is called a Chapiney, which they weare
                    vnder their shoes. Many of them are curiously painted; some also I haue seene
                    fairely gilt: so vncomely a thing (in my opinion) that it is pitty this foolish
                    custom is not cleane banished and exterminated out of the citie. There are many
                    of these Chapineys of a great heigth, euen half a yard high, which maketh many
                    of their women that are very short seeme much taller than the tallest women we
                    haue in England. Also I haue heard that this is obserued amongst them, that by
                    how much the nobler a woman is, by so much the higher are her Chapineys. All
                    their gentlewomen, and most of their wiues and widowes that are of any wealth,
                    are assisted and supported eyther by men or women when they walke abroad, to the
                    end they may not fall. They are borne vp most commonly by the left arme,
                    otherwise they might quickly take a fall. For I saw a woman fall a very
                    dangerous fall, as she was going down the staires of one of the little stony
                    bridges with her high Chapineys alone by herselfe: but I did nothing pitty her,
                    because shee wore such friuolous and (as I may truely terme them) ridiculous
                    instruments, which were the occasion of her fall. For both I myselfe, and many
                    other strangers (as I haue obserued in Venice) haue often laughed at them for
                    their vaine Chapineys.</quote>

                <quote><hi rend="ital">Chrisome</hi> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a xri/w</foreign> [<hi rend="ital">to anoint</hi>—with the holy oil formerly used in baptism])
                  signifies properly the white cloth which is set by the minister of baptism upon
                  the head of a child newly anointed with chrism after his baptism. Now it is
                  vulgarly taken for the white cloth put about or upon a child newly christened, in
                  token of his baptism; wherewith the women use to shroud the child, if dying within
                  the month; otherwise it is usually brought to church at the day of purification.
                    <hi rend="ital">Chrisoms,</hi> in the bills of mortality, are such children as
                  die within the month of birth, because during that time they use to wear the
                  chrisom-cloth.</quote> (In the first edition of Blount's work, 1656, I do not find
                the concluding sentence of the above quotation.) </entryFree>

                  <quote>There is hardly a doubt that it [the term <hi rend="ital">cockney</hi>]
                    originates in an Utopian region of indolence and luxury, formerly denominated
                    the country of <hi rend="ital">cocaigne.</hi> . . . With us the lines cited by
                    Camden in his <title>Britannia,</title> vol. i. col. 451, <lb/> ‘Were I in my

                    London was formerly known by this satirical name; and hence a Londoner came to

                  <quote>The term <hi rend="ital">cocknay</hi> appears in the
                      <title>Promptorium</title> to imply simply a child spoiled by too much
                    indulgence. . . . There can be little doubt that the word is to be traced to the
                    imaginary region ‘ihote Cokaygne,’ described in the curious poem given by
                    Hickes, Gramm. A. Sax. p. 231, and apparently translated from the French.
                    Compare ‘<hi rend="ital">le Fabliaus de Coquaigne,</hi>’ Fabl. Barbazan et Méon.
                    iv. 175. Palsgrave gives the verb ‘To bring up lyke a cocknaye,’ <hi rend="ital">mignotter;</hi> and Elyot renders ‘<hi rend="ital">delicias facere,</hi> to
                    play the cockney.’ ‘<hi rend="ital">Dodeliner,</hi> to bring vp wantonly, as a
                    cockney.’ Hollyband's Treasurie. See also Baret's <title>Alvearie</title>.
                    Chaucer uses the word as a term of contempt; and it occasionally signifies a
                    little cook, <hi rend="ital">coquinator.</hi></quote>

                </cit> In Shakespeare's days it was very common for money-lenders to force
                prodigals, like young Master Rash, to take a portion of the sum they wanted to

                the veriest trumpery, brown paper, lutestrings, etc.,—of which goods the said

                  <quote>This is from Shakespeare, and the plain meaning of the phrase is, that the
                    affability and sweetness of Giovanni were of a <hi rend="ital">heavenly</hi>
                    kind, that is, more perfect than was usually found among men; resembling that
                    divine condescension which excludes none from its regard, and therefore
                    immediately derived or <hi rend="ital">stolen</hi> from heaven, from whence all
                    good proceeds. In this there is no impropriety: common usage warrants the
                    application of the term to a variety of actions which imply nothing of
                    turpitude, but rather the contrary: affections are <hi rend="ital">stolen</hi>—in a word, to <hi rend="ital">steal,</hi> here, and in many other
                    places, means little else than to win by imperceptible progression, by gentle
                    violence, etc.</quote>

                  <quote>A cresset light was the same as a beacon light, but occasionally portable.
                    It consisted of a wreathed rope smeared with pitch and placed in a cage of iron
                    like a trivet, which was suspended on pivots in a kind of fork. The light
                    sometimes issued from a hollow pan filled with combustibles. The term is not, as
                    Hanmer and others have stated, from the French
                      <mentioned>croissette,</mentioned> a little cross, but rather from
                      <mentioned>croiset,</mentioned> a cruet or earthen pot; yet as the French
                    language furnishes no similar word for the cresset itself, we might prefer a
                    different etymology, etc. </quote>

                  <quote>The question whether Shallow represented Sir Dagonet at Mile-end-green or
                    Clement's inn, although it has been maintained on either side with great
                    plausibility, must ever remain undecided; but Mr. Malone's acute and ingenious
                    conjecture, that <mentioned>Arthur's show</mentioned> was an
                      <mentioned>exhibition of archery,</mentioned> and not an
                      <mentioned>interlude,</mentioned> will no longer admit of any doubt. The truth
                    of both these positions will appear from the following circumstances. In 1682
                    there was published ‘A remembrance of the worthy <mentioned>show</mentioned> and
                    shooting by the Duke of Shoreditch and his associates the worshipful citizens of
                    London upon Tuesday the 17th of September 1583, set forth according to the truth
                    thereof to the everlasting honour of the game of shooting in the long bow. By W.
                    M.,’ in p. 40 of which book is this passage: ‘The prince of famous memory King
                    Henry the Eighth, having red in the chronicles of England, and seen in his own
                    time how armies mixed with good archers have evermore so galled the enemy, that
                    it hath been great cause of the victory, he being one day <hi rend="ital">at
                      Mile-end when Prince Arthur and his knights were there shooting</hi> did
                    greatly commend the game, and allowed thereof, lauding them to their
                    encouragement.’ One should be very much inclined to suppose this decisive of the
                    first question, and that these <mentioned>shows</mentioned> were usually held at
                      <mentioned>Mile-end</mentioned>; but this is by no means the case. The work
                    proceeds to state that King Henry the Eighth, keeping at one time a princely
                    court at Windsor, caused sundry matches to be made concerning shooting with the
                    long bow; at which one Barlo, who belonged to his majesty's guard, remaining to
                    shoot, the king said to him, ‘Win thou all, and thou shalt be duke over all
                    archers.’ Barlo drew his bow and won the match; whereat the king being pleased,
                    commended him for his good archery; and the man dwelling in Shoreditch, the king
                    named him <mentioned>Duke of Shoreditch.</mentioned> One of the successors to
                    this duke appointed a <mentioned>show</mentioned> on the 17th of September 1583,
                    to be held in Smithfield and other parts of the city, which is here very
                    circumstantially described; and among many other curious particulars it is
                    mentioned that the citizens and inhabitants of Fleetbridge, etc., followed with
                    a <mentioned>show</mentioned> worth beholding of seemly archers; ‘then the odd
                    devise of <mentioned>Saint Clements parish,</mentioned> which but ten days
                    before had made the same <mentioned>show</mentioned> in their own parish, in
                    setting up the queen's majesties stake in Hol born fields, which stakemaster
                    Knevit, one of the gentlemen of her majesties chamber, gave unto them at his
                    cost and charges; and a <mentioned>gunn</mentioned> worth three pound, made of
                    gold, to be given unto him that best deserved it by shooting in a peece at the
                    mark which was set up on purpose at Saint Jame's wall.’ This, however, was not
                    solely a shooting with fire-arms, but also with bows: for in the account of the
                      <mentioned>show</mentioned> itself, which immediately follows, men bearing
                    ‘shields and shafts’ are mentioned, and ‘a worthy <mentioned>show of archers
                      following.</mentioned>’ In the continuation of the description of the
                    Smithfield <mentioned>show</mentioned> mention is made of ‘the baron
                      <mentioned>Stirrop,</mentioned> whose costly stake will be in memorys after he
                    is dead, now standing at <mentioned>Mile-end;</mentioned>’ and again, ‘And this
                    one thing is worthy of memory, that upon the day of <mentioned>Prince Arthur's
                      shooting,</mentioned> which was five weeks before this show, the duke, willing
                    to beautifie the same in some seemly sort, sent a buck of that season by the
                    marquess <mentioned>Barlo</mentioned> (the name of this person was kept up long
                    after his decease), accompanied with many goldsmiths, who coming in satten
                    dublets and chains of gold about their bodies, with horns at their backs, did
                    all the way wind their horns, and presented the same to <mentioned>prince
                      Arthur,</mentioned> who was at his tent, which was at <mentioned>Mile-end
                      green.</mentioned>’ We see therefore that Shakespeare having <mentioned>both
                      these shows</mentioned> in his recollection, has made Shallow, a talkative
                    simpleton, refer to them indistinctly, and that probably by design, and with a
                    due attention to the nature of his character. What Shallow afterwards says about
                    the management of the <mentioned>little quiver fellow's</mentioned> piece, or
                      <mentioned>caliver,</mentioned> will not weigh in either scale; because in all
                    these <mentioned>shows</mentioned> there were musketeers. In that at Smithfield
                    the feryers marched, consisting of ‘one hundred handsome fellowes with
                      <mentioned>calivers</mentioned> on their necks, all trimly decked with white
                    feathers in their hats.’ <mentioned>Maister Thomas Smith,</mentioned> who in Mr.
                    Malone's note is said to have personated Prince Arthur, was ‘chiefe customer to
                    her majesty in the port of London;’ and to him Richard Robinson, a translator of
                    several books in the reign of Elizabeth, dedicated his <mentioned>Auncient
                      order, societie and unitie laudable of Prince Arthure and his knightly armory
                      of the round table, with a threefold assertion frendly in favour and
                      furtherance of English archery at this day,</mentioned> 1583, 4to. Such part
                    of this work as regards Prince Arthur is chiefly a translation from the French,
                    being a description of the arms of the knights of the round table; the rest is a
                    panegyric in verse by Robinson himself in praise of archery. It appears from the
                    dedication that King Henry VIII. confirmed by charter to the citizens of London,
                    the ‘famous order of knightes of prince Arthur's round table or society: like as
                    in his life time when he sawe a good archer in deede, he chose him and ordained
                    such a one for a knight of the same order.’ . . . Whatever part Sir Dagonet took
                    in this show would doubtless be borrowed from Mallory's romance of the
                      <mentioned>Mort Arture,</mentioned> which had been compiled in the reign of
                    Henry VII. What there occurs relating to Sir Dagonet was extracted from the
                    excellent and ancient story of <mentioned>Tristan de Leonnois,</mentioned> in
                    which Dagonet is represented as the fool of king Arthur. He is sometimes dressed
                    up in armour and set on to attack the knights of Cornwall, who are uniformly
                    described as cowards. It once happened that a certain knight, who for a
                    particular reason had been called <mentioned>Sir Cotte mal taillée</mentioned>
                    by Sir Kay, king Arthur's seneschal, was, at the instance of Sir Kay, attacked
                    by poor Dagonet; but the latter was very soon made to repent of his rashness and
                    thrown over his horse's crupper. On another occasion Tristan himself, in the
                    disguise of a fool, handles Sir Dagonet very roughly; but he, regardless of
                    these tricks of fortune, is afterwards persuaded to attack Mark the king of
                    Cornwall, who is in reality a coward of the first magnitude. Mark, supposing him
                    to be Lancelot of the lake, runs away, and is pursued by the other; but the
                    persons who had set on Sir Dagonet, becoming apprehensive for the consequences,
                    follow them, as ‘they would not,’ says the romance, ‘for no good, that Sir
                    Dagonet were hurt; for king Arthur loved him passing well, and made him knight
                    with his owne hands.’ King Mark at length meets with another knight, who,
                    perceiving his cowardice, attacks Dagonet and tumbles him from his horse. In the
                    romance of <mentioned>Sir Perceval li Gallois,</mentioned> Kay, the seneschal of
                    Arthur, being offended with Dagonet for insinuating that he was not the most
                    valorous of knights, kicks him into the fire. So much for the hero personated by
                    Master Justice Shallow</quote>

                    opposite uses of the word in our great poet: ‘<mentioned>Dearth</mentioned> is
                    the third person singular of the English (from the AngloSaxon verb Derian,
                    nocere, lædere), <mentioned>to dere.</mentioned> It means some or any season,
                    weather, or other cause, which <mentioned>dereth,</mentioned> that is, maketh
                      <mentioned>dear,</mentioned> hurteth, or doth mischief.—The English verb
                      <mentioned>to dere</mentioned> was formerly in common use.’ He then produces
                    about twenty examples, the last from <title>Hamlet</title> [i. 2. 182-183],
                      <lb/><quote>‘Would I had met my <mentioned>dearest</mentioned> foe in heaven

                  <quote>Throughout Shakespeare and all the poets of his and a much later day, we
                    find this epithet [<mentioned>dearest</mentioned>] applied to that person or
                    thing, which, for or against us, excites the liveliest and strongest interest.
                    It is used variously, indefinitely and metaphorically, to express the warmest
                    feelings of the soul; its nearest, most intimate, home and heartfelt emotions:
                    and here [‘my dearest foe,’ <bibl>Hamlet, act i. sc. 2</bibl>], no doubt,
                    though, as every where else, more directly interpreted, signifying ‘veriest,
                    extremest,’ must by consequence and figuratively import ‘bitterest, deadliest,
                    most mortal.’ As extremes are said in a certain sense to approximate, and are in
                    many respects alike or the same, so this word is made in a certain sense to
                    carry with it an union of the fiercest opposites: it is made to signify the
                    extremes of love and hatred. It may be said to be equivalent generally to
                      <mentioned>very;</mentioned> and to import ‘the excess, the utmost, the
                      <mentioned>superlative</mentioned>’ of that, whatever it may be, to which it
                    is applied. But to suppose, with Tooke (<title>Divers. of Purl.</title> ii.
                    409), that in <hi rend="ital">all</hi> cases <mentioned>dear</mentioned> must at
                    that time have meant ‘injurious,’ as being derived from the Saxon verb
                      <mentioned>dere,</mentioned> to hurt, is perfectly absurd. Dr. Johnson's
                    derivation of the word, as used in this place, from the Latin
                      <mentioned>dirus,</mentioned> is doubtless ridiculous enough; but Tooke has
                    not produced a single instance of the use of it, that is, of the adjective, in
                    the sense upon which he insists; except, as he pretends, from our author, etc. </quote>

                  <quote>Horne Tooke (<title>Divers. of Purley,</title> 612, etc.) makes a plausible
                    case in favour of <mentioned>dear</mentioned> being derived from the ancient
                    verb <mentioned>derian,</mentioned> to hurt, to annoy, and of its proper meaning
                    being, therefore, injurious or hateful [hurtful]. His notion seems to be, that
                    from this <mentioned>derian</mentioned> we have <mentioned>dearth,</mentioned>
                    meaning properly that sort of injury which is done by the weather, and that, a
                    usual consequence of dearth being to make the produce of the earth high-priced,
                    the adjective <mentioned>dear</mentioned> has thence taken its common meaning of
                    precious. This is not all distinctly asserted; but what of it may not be
                    explicitly set forth is supposed and implied. It is, however, against an
                    explanation which has been generally accepted, that there is no appearance of
                    connexion between <mentioned>derian</mentioned> and the contemporary word
                    answering to <mentioned>dear</mentioned> in the sense of high-priced, precious,
                    beloved, which is <mentioned>deore,</mentioned>
                    <mentioned>dúre,</mentioned> or <mentioned>dyre,</mentioned> and is evidently
                    from the same root, not with <mentioned>derian,</mentioned> but with
                      <mentioned>deóran,</mentioned> or <mentioned>dýran,</mentioned> to hold dear,
                    to love. There is no doubt about the existence of an old English verb
                      <mentioned>dere,</mentioned> meaning to hurt, the unquestionable
                    representative of the original <mentioned>derian:</mentioned> thus in Chaucer
                      (<title>C. T.</title> 1824) Theseus says to Palamon and Arcite, in the
                    Knight's Tale: <lb/> ‘And ye shul bothe anon unto me swere <lb/>That never mo ye
                    shul my contree <mentioned>dere,</mentioned>
                    <lb/>Ne maken werre upon me night ne day, <lb/>But ben my frendes in alle that
                    ye may.’ But perhaps we may get most easily and naturally at the sense which
                      <mentioned>dear</mentioned> sometimes assumes by supposing that the notion
                    properly involved in it of love, having first become generalized into that of a
                    strong affection of any kind, had thence passed on into that of such an emotion
                    the very reverse of love. We seem to have it in the intermediate sense in such
                    instances as the following: <lb/> ‘Some <mentioned>dear</mentioned> cause
                    <lb/>Will in concealment wrap me up a while.’ <lb/><hi rend="ital">King
                      Lear,</hi> iv. 3. 51. <lb/><lb/> ‘A precious ring; a ring that I must use
                    <lb/>In <mentioned>dear</mentioned> employment.’ Romeo and Juliet, v. 3. 32. And
                    even when Hamlet speaks of his ‘<mentioned>dearest</mentioned> foe,’ or when
                    Celia remarks to Rosalind, in <title>As You Like It,</title> i. 3. 31, ‘My
                    father hated his [Orlando's] father <mentioned>dearly,</mentioned>’ the word
                    need not be understood as implying more than strong or passionate
                    emotion</quote>

                    that is, when the whole song is not passing three voyces. Last of all, they take
                    it for singing a part extempore vpon a playnesong, in which sence we commonly
                    vse it: so that when a man talketh of a Descanter, it must be vnderstood of one
                    that can extempore sing a part vpon a playne song.</quote>

                famous lutenist, was born in 1562. Being of a rambling disposition, he lived much
                abroad, and so, it seems, lost many opportunities of advancing his fortunes. He was,
                for a time, lutenist to the King of Denmark, who had begged him of King James. It
                appears that he died in England, in 1615. See Hawkins's <title>Hist. of

                  <bibl> THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR, iv. 5. 80.</bibl>
                </cit> Mr. Knight was the first to start the idea that here we have an allusion to a
                real German duke who, with his suite, visited Windsor in 1592,—viz. the Duke of
                Wütemberg, of whose journey an account, written by his secretary, was printed at
                Tubingen in 1602. <quote>He was honoured,</quote> writes Mr. Halliwell, <quote>with
                  the use of one of the Queen's coaches, attended by a page of honour, and
                  ‘travelled from London in this coach, and several post-horses [<hi rend="ital">sic</hi>], towards the royal residence.’ On such an occasion the post-horses
                  would have to be furnished by the various inn-keepers free of expense;—‘cozenage!
                  mere cozenage,’ as Master Bardolph says. The scene is, in all probability, an
                  exaggerated satire on the visit of the Duke to Windsor; an allusion that would
                  have been well understood by the Court within a year or two after its
                  occurrence,</quote> etc. Mr. Staunton very well observes, <quote>If any allusion
                  to a visitor received by the Court with so much distinction were intended, an
                  offensive one would hardly have been ventured during the life-time of the
                  Queen;</quote> but, as there is no end to conjecture, he subsequently remarks that
                probably an allusion was covertly intended to some other visit of the same nobleman,
                who was in England in 1610, <quote>and it is not unreasonable to suppose he might
                  have visited us more than twice in the long interval of eighteen years.</quote>

                    Heliodorus's <title>Æthiopics,</title> to which our author was indebted for the
                    allusion. This <mentioned>Egyptian thief</mentioned> was Thyamis, who was a
                    native of Memphis, and at the head of a band of robbers. Theagenes and Chariclea
                    falling into their hands, Thyamis fell desperately in love with the lady, and
                    would have married her. Soon after, a stronger body of robbers coming down upon
                    Thyamis's party, he was in such fears for his mistress that he had her shut into
                    a cave with his treasure. It was customary with those barbarians, when they
                    despaired of their own safety, first to make away with those whom they held
                    dear, and desired for companions in the next life. Thyamis, therefore, benetted
                    round with his enemies, raging with love, jealousy, and anger, went to his cave;
                    and calling aloud in the Egyptian tongue, so soon as he heard himself answered
                    towards the cave's mouth by a Grecian, making to the person by the direction of
                    her voice, he caught her by the hair with his left hand, and (supposing her to
                    be Chariclea) with his right hand plunged his sword into her breast</quote>

                  <quote>The person here meant was Thomas Nevil, bastard son to the Lord
                    Faulconbridge; ‘a man,’ says Hall, ‘of no less corage than audacitie, who, for
                    his euel condicions was such an apte person, that a more meter could not be
                    chosen to set all the worlde in a broyle, and to put the estate of the realme on
                    an yl hazard.’ He had been appointed by Warwick vice-admiral of the sea, and had
                    in charge so to keep the passage between Dover and Calais, that none which
                    either favoured King Henry or his friends should escape untaken or undrowned:
                    such at least were his instructions with respect to the friends and favourers of
                    King Edward after the rupture between him and Warwick. On Warwick's death, he
                    fell into poverty, and robbed, both by sea and land, as well friends as enemies.
                    He once brought his ships up the Thames, and with a considerable body of the men
                    of Kent and Essex, made a spirited assault on the city, with a view to plunder
                    and pillage, which was not repelled but after a sharp conflict and the loss of
                    many lives; and, had it happened at a more critical period, might have been
                    attended with fatal consequences to Edward. After roving on the sea some little
                    time longer, he ventured to land at Southampton, where he was taken and
                    beheaded. See Hall and Holinshed</quote>

                    A leathern belt is made up into a number of intricate folds, and placed edgewise
                    upon a table. One of the folds is made to resemble the middle of the girdle, so
                    that whoever should thrust a skewer into it would think he held it fast to the
                    table; whereas, when he has so done, the person with whom he plays may take hold
                    of both ends, and draw it away. This trick is now known to the common people by

                    Moorgate, to wit, about and beyond the lordship of Finsbury, were destroyed, and
                    of them was made a plain field to shoot in. It was called
                      <mentioned>Finsbury</mentioned> field, in which there were three windmills,
                    and here they usually shoot at twelve score. Stow, 1633, p. 913. In Jonson's
                    time, this was the usual resort of the plainer citizens. People of fashion, or
                    who aspired to be thought so, probably mixed but little in those parties; and
                    hence we may account for the indignation of Master Stephen at being suspected of
                    such vulgarity [see Jonson's <title>Every Man in his Humour,</title> act i. sc.
                    1]. An idea of a similar kind occurs in Shakespeare, ‘As if thou ne'er walk'st,’

                  <quote>Cerimon in most express terms declares that he feels more real satisfaction
                    in his liberal employment as a physician, than he should in the uncertain
                    pursuit of honour, or in the mere accumulation of wealth; which would assimilate
                    him to a miser, the result of whose labour is merely to entertain the fool and
                    death. . . . The allusion therefore is to some such print as Mr. Steevens
                    happily remembered to have seen, in which death plunders the miser of his
                    money-bags, whilst the fool is grinning at the process. It may be presumed that
                    these subjects were common in Shakespeare's time. They might have ornamented the
                    poor man's cottage in the shape of rude prints, or have been introduced into
                    halfpenny ballads long since consigned to oblivion. The miser is at all times
                    fair game; and to prove that this is not a chimerical opinion, and at the same
                    time to show the extensive range of this popular subject, a few prints of the
                    kind shall be mentioned. 1. Death and the two misers, by Michael Pregel. 2. An
                    old couple counting their money, death and two devils attending, a mezzotint by
                    Vander Bruggen. 3. A similar mezzotint by Meheux without the devils. 4. An old
                    print on a <mentioned>single sheet</mentioned> of a dance of death, on which
                    both the <mentioned>miser</mentioned> and the <mentioned>fool</mentioned> are
                    exhibited in the clutches of the grim monarch. The rear may be closed with the
                    same subject as represented in the various <mentioned>dances of
                      death</mentioned> that still remain. Nor should it be concluded that because
                    these prints exhibit no fool to grin at the impending scene, others might not
                    have done so. The satirical introduction of this character on many occasions
                    supports the probability that they did. Thus in a painting of the school of
                    Holbein, an old man makes love to a girl, attended by a fool and death, to show,
                    in the first instance, the folly of the thing, and, in the next, its
                    consequences. It is un necessary to pursue the argument, as every print of the
                    above kind that may in future occur will itself speak much more forcibly than
                    any thing which can here be added</quote>

                    the fool escaping from the pursuit of Death is introduced. Ritson has denied the
                    existence of any such farces, and he is perhaps right with respect to printed
                    ones; but vestiges of such a drama were observed several years ago at the fair
                    of Bristol by the present writer [See what follows]</quote>

                  <quote>Mr. Douce, to whom our readers are indebted for several happy illustrations
                    of Shakespeare, assures me that some years ago, at a fair in a large
                    market-town, he observed a solitary figure sitting in a booth, and apparently
                    exhausted with fatigue. This person was habited in a close black vest painted
                    over with bones in imitation of a skeleton. But my informant being then very
                    young, and wholly uninitiated in theatrical antiquities, made no inquiry
                    concerning so whimsical a phenomenon. [Douce observes that the following
                    additional circumstances communicated by him to Steevens had probably escaped
                    his recollection, —<quote>that his informant concerning the skeleton character
                      at the fair remembered also to have seen another personage in the habit of a
                      fool; and that arriving when the performances at the booth were finished for
                      the evening, he could not succeed in procuring a repetition of the piece,
                      losing thereby the means of all further information on the subject.</quote>]
                    Indeed, but for what follows, I might have been induced to suppose that the
                    object he saw was nothing more or less than the hero of a well-known pantomime,
                    entitled Harlequin Skeleton. This circumstance, however, having accidentally
                    reached the ears of a venerable clergyman who is now more than eighty years of
                    age, he told me that he very well remembered to have met with such another
                    figure, above fifty years ago, at Salisbury. Being there during the time of some
                    public meeting, he happened to call on a surgeon at the very instant when the
                    representative of <mentioned>Death</mentioned> was brought in to be let blood on
                    account of a tumble he had had on the stage, while in pursuit of his antagonist,
                    a <mentioned>Merry Andrew,</mentioned> who very anxiously attended him (dressed
                    also in character) to the phlebotomist's house. The same gentleman's curiosity,
                    a few days afterwards, prevailed on him to be spectator of the dance in which
                    our emblem of mortality was a performer. This dance, he says, entirely consisted
                    of <mentioned>Death's</mentioned> contrivances to surprise the <mentioned>Merry
                      Andrew,</mentioned> and of the <mentioned>Merry Andrew's</mentioned> efforts
                    to elude the stratagems of <mentioned>Death,</mentioned> by whom at last he was
                    overpowered; his <mentioned>finale</mentioned> being attended with such
                    circumstances as mark the exit of the Dragon of Wantley. . . . It should seem
                    that the general idea of this serio-comic <mentioned>pas-de-deux</mentioned> had
                    been borrowed from the ancient Dance of Machabre, commonly called The Dance of
                    Death, a grotesque ornament of cloisters, both here and in foreign parts. The
                    aforesaid combination of figures, though erroneously ascribed to Hans Holbein,
                    was certainly of an origin more remote than the times in which that eminent
                    painter is known to have flourished</quote>

                  <quote>The letter [representing a struggle between Death and the Fool] that occurs
                    in Stowe's <title>Survey of London,</title> edit. 1618, 4to, is only an enlarged
                    but imperfect copy from another belonging to a regular Dance of Death used as
                    initials by some of the Basil printers in the sixteenth century, and which, from
                    the extraordinary skill that accompanies their execution, will ever rank amongst
                    the finest efforts in the art of engraving on blocks of wood or metal. Most of
                    the subjects in this Dance of Death have undoubtedly been supplied by that
                    curious pageant of mortality which, during the middle ages, was so great a
                    favourite as to be perpetually exhibited to the people either in the sculpture
                    and painting of ecclesiastical buildings, or in the books adapted to the service
                    of the church: yet some of them but ill accord with those serious ideas which
                    the nature of the subject is calculated to inspire. In these the artist has
                    indulged a vein of broad and satirical humour which was not wholly reserved for
                    the caricatures of modern times; and in one or two instances he has even
                    overleaped the bounds of decency. The letter in Stowe's <title>Survey</title> is
                    the only one that appears to have been imitated from the above alphabet. . . .
                    It is to be remembered that in most of the old <mentioned>dances of
                      death</mentioned> the subject of the fool is introduced; and it is, on the
                    whole, extremely probable that some such representation might have suggested the

                    idle manner. By way of enforcing some kind of regularity, and, perhaps, at least
                    as much to promote drinking, certain laws were usually hung up, the
                    transgression of which was to be punished by specific forfeitures. It is not to

                  Society,</title> 1857, p. 134), who maintains that the lady in our text is looking
                through her fingers just as a woman is represented doing at the drunken and naked
                Noah in a picture by Gozzoli in the Campo Santo, and as maids are said to do at a

                    enemy, and to find out their strength, made this report: ‘May it please you, my
                    liege, there are enough to be killed, enough to be taken prisoners, and enough
                    to run away.’ He saved the king's life in the field. Had our poet been apprized
                    of this circumstance, this brave Welshman would probably have been more
                    particularly noticed, and not have been merely registered in a muster-roll of

                  <quote>This alludes to the manner of carrying a barrel, by putting it on a sling,
                    which is thus described by R. Holme: ‘The slings are a strong, thick, yet short
                    pole, not above a yard and an half long: to the middle is fixed a strong plate
                    with a hole, in which is put a hook . . . on this hook is [are] fastened two
                    other short chains, with broad-pointed hooks, with them clasping the ends of the
                    barrels above the heads, the barrel is lifted up, and borne by two men to any
                    place, as is shewed Chap. V. No. 146.’ <title>Acad. of Armory,</title> B. iii.
                    chap. vii. [sect ] 121. Most people who live in London have seen the operation,
                    in taking a barrel from the dray, which is exactly represented by Holme's
                    figure. It is evident, that to hang or <mentioned>gibbet</mentioned> a barrel on
                    the pole, in this manner, must be done by a quick movement, so as to attach both

                  <quote><mentioned>Carnations and Gillovors,</mentioned> or gilloflowers, belong to
                    the genus Dianthus, and were well known in the time of Shakspere. Parkinson, in
                    his ‘Garden of all sorts of Pleasant Flowers,’ dedicated to the Queen of Charles
                    I., and published in 1629, says that ‘carnations and gilloflowers be the
                    chiefest flowers of account in all our English gardens;’ and he calls them
                      <mentioned>the pride of our English gardens,</mentioned> and <mentioned>the
                      queen of delight and of flowers,</mentioned> and adds: ‘They flower not until
                    the heat of the year, which is in July, and continue flowering until the colds
                    of the autumn check them, or until they have wholly outspent themselves; and
                    these fair flowers are usually <mentioned>increased by slips.</mentioned>’ He
                    also distinguishes them from the gilloflower called stock gillovor. Gerarde, in
                    his ‘Herball,’ describing the carnation-gillofloure, says: ‘On the top of the
                    stalks do grow very fair flowers, of an excellent sweet smell, and pleasant
                    carnation colour, whereof it took his name.’ Tusser, in ‘Five Hundred Points of
                    Good Husbandry,’ notices gilloflowers red, white, and carnation, as distinct
                    from wall gilloflowers and stock gilloflowers, and adds: <lb/> ‘The gilloflower
                    also, the skilful doe know, <lb/>Doth look to be covered in frost and in snow.’
                    Spenser, in <title>‘Hobbinol's Dittie’</title> [<title>The Shepheards Calendar,
                      April</title>] has the following: <lb/> ‘Bring hither the pink and purple
                    cullumbine,<lb/> With gillyflowers; <lb/>Bring sweet carnations [Bring
                    coronations], and sops in wine, <lb/>Worn of paramours.’<lb/> Sir W. J. Hooker's
                    ‘British Flora,’ vol. i. p. 177, under <mentioned>Dianthus
                      Caryophyllus</mentioned> (clove-pink carnation, or clove gillyflower), says:
                    ‘Few persons, on seeing this plant, as it grows on old walls, would suppose it
                    was the origin of one of the <quote>fairest flowers of the season,</quote>
                    <lb/>
                    <quote>The curious choice clove July flower,</quote><lb/> or carnation of our
                    gardens, with its endless diversity of colour and form; yet such it is always
                    considered to be.’ The streaked gillovors, noticed by Perdita, are produced by
                    the flowers of one kind being impregnated by the pollen of another kind, and
                    this art (or law) in nature Shakspere alludes to in the delicate language used
                    by Perdita, as well as to the practice of increasing the plants by
                    slips.</quote>

                    stone houses, often of considerable extent and height, and, being placed in a
                    central position to a large estate, they must often have been, as Shakespeare's
                    grange, solitary, while the windows being small (as they were in all the

                    . . . The Spanish writers are peculiarly enthusiastic in the praise of green

                and (what is more to the purpose) quotes a passage of Pliny where we are told that

                  (<title>Nat. Hist.</title> lib. xxv. cap. 4); on the other hand, a passage of

                  the text, that it is presumed very little doubt will now remain on the occasion.
                  It is not surprising that the <mentioned>dropping into the ears</mentioned> should
                  occur, because Shakspeare was perfectly well acquainted with the supposed
                  properties of henbane as recorded in Holland's translation of Pliny, and
                  elsewhere, and might apply this mode of use to any other poison.</quote> (In

                  considers the epithet ‘Herculean,’ which Cleopatra applies to Antony, and reads
                  the following extract from Shakespeare's authority, hesitate for an instant to

                  <quote>an illustrious ancestor</quote> without the addition of some other words to
                render his meaning clear. </p>

                    well-established fact that a person named Grantham, who contracted with the
                    bailiff for the removal of the trees, fell into disgrace with the King for

                noticed by Sir Walter Raleigh in <title>The History of the World</title> (B. i. ch.
                2). This celebrated animal was called Marocco, and belonged to a Scotchman named
                Bankes, who, it appears, taught him to perform such feats as neither Astley nor
                Ducrow in our own time has been able to teach his horses:—the most remarkable
                exploit of Marocco was his ascending to the top of St. Paul's Cathedral in 1600.
                Bankes exhibited his wonderful horse in various parts of Europe; and we are told
                that at last they were both brought to the stake at Rome as magicians (according to
                Ben Jonson in his cxxxiii<hi rend="super">d</hi><title>Epigram,</title> they were
                  <quote>beyond sea, burned for one witch;</quote> and according to a note in the
                mock-romance <title>Don Zara del Fogo,</title>
                <quote>they were both burned by the commandment of the Pope</quote>). But, in
                opposition to all this, Mr. Halliwell has adduced an extract from one of the
                Ashmolean Mss. to show that Bankes was alive in 1637. <pb n="365"/>

                </cit> On a passage of Jonson's <title>Every Man out of his Humour</title> Whalley
                  remarks:<quote>What was usually called the <mentioned>manners</mentioned> in a
                  play or poem, began now to be called the <mentioned>humours.</mentioned> The word
                  was new; the use, or rather abuse, of it, was excessive. It was applied upon all
                  occasions, with as little judgment as wit. Every coxcomb had it always in his
                  mouth; and every particularity he affected was denominated by the name of
                    <mentioned>humour,</mentioned></quote> etc. Gifford adds:<cit>
                  <quote>The abuse of this word is well ridiculed by Shakespeare in that amusing
                    creature of whimsey, Nym, <title>Merry Wives of Windsor</title> [and <title>King

                  <bibl> RICHARD III., iv. 4. 175.</bibl>
                </cit> No satisfactory explanation, as far as I am aware, has yet been given of
                these words. In old St. Paul's was a monument wrongly supposed to be that of
                Humphrey Duke of Gloucester (who really was buried at St. Alban's), from which a
                part of the church was known by the name of <mentioned>Duke Humphrey's
                  Walk;</mentioned> and there, as St. Paul's was a place of public resort, those who
                were unable to procure a dinner used to saunter, perhaps in the hope of receiving an
                invitation from some of their acquaintances. This was the origin of the expression
                  <mentioned>dining with Duke Humphrey;</mentioned> and Steevens conjectures that
                  <quote>Shakespeare might by this strange phrase, <mentioned>Humphrey
                    Hour,</mentioned> have designed to mark the hour at which the good Duchess was
                  as hungry as the followers of Duke Humphrey.</quote> Malone, on the other hand,
                    says:<quote><mentioned>Humphrey Hour</mentioned> is merely used in ludicrous
                  language for <mentioned>hour,</mentioned> like <mentioned>Tom Troth</mentioned>
                  for <mentioned>truth,</mentioned> and twenty more such terms. So, in Gabriel

                  change its meaning, and to be used to signify <mentioned>a house of

                    part with a quill, affixed to it by springs of bristle. These jacks were
                    directed by the finger-key to the string which was struck by the quill, then
                    forced past the string by the elastic spring, giving it liberty to sound as long
                    as the finger rested on the key. When the finger was removed, the quill returned
                    to its place, and a small piece of cloth, fixed on the top of the jack, resting

                  <quote>What he [Antigonus] means—and the excessive grossness of the idea can

                    he should believe every woman is unchaste; his own wife as licentious as
                    Semiramis (‘<mentioned>Equum adamatum a Semiramide,</mentioned>’ etc.,

                    ‘keep’ is so common, even in Shakespeare, that it is amazing no one should have
                    seen its application here. For example, ‘Dromio, <mentioned>keep</mentioned> the

                      ‘<mentioned>Keep</mentioned> the door close, sirrah.’ <title>Henry
                      VIII.,</title> v. 4. 28. ‘I thank you: <mentioned>keep</mentioned> the door.’

                  <quote>The modern editors of Shakespeare take a very unwarrantable liberty with

                    that it is used in a two-fold sense, sometimes for the jacket merely, and
                    sometimes for the train or upper-petticoat attached to it. A full kirtle was
                    always a jacket and petticoat, a <mentioned>half-kirtle</mentioned> (a term
                    which frequently occurs) was either the one or the other; but our ancestors, who
                    wrote when this article of dress was every where in use, and when there was
                    little danger of being misunderstood, most commonly contented themselves with
                    the simple term (<mentioned>kirtle</mentioned>), leaving the sense to be

                  <quote>One cannot but wonder that this passage should have perplexed the
                    commentators. In Marlowe's <title>Lust's Dominion</title> the Queen says to the
                    Moor: <lb/> ‘Come, let's kisse. <lb/><hi rend="ital">Moor.</hi> Away, away.
                      <lb/><hi rend="ital">Queen.</hi> No, no, sayes <hi rend="ital">I;</hi> and
                      <mentioned>twice away,</mentioned> sayes <mentioned>stay.</mentioned>’<lb/>
                    Sir Philip Sidney has enlarged upon this thought in the sixty-third stanza of
                    his <title>Astrophel and Stella</title></quote>

                <quote>The Morals written and exhibited subsequent to the Reformation almost
                  invariably closed with an ‘epilogue,’ in which prayers were offered up by the
                  actors (usually kneeling) for the King, Queen, nobility, clergy, and sometimes for
                  the commons. This practice continued in the beginning of the 17th century, and the
                  most recent instance that I am aware of is the epilogue to [Chapman's] <title>Two

                  <quote>Autolycus here gives us to understand that he is a thief of the first
                    class. This he explains by an allusion to an odd vulgar notion. The common
                    people, many of them, think that, if any one can find a kite's nest, when she
                    hath young, before they are fledged, and sew up their back doors, so as they
                    cannot mute, the mother kite, in compassion to their distress, will steal
                      <mentioned>lesser linen,</mentioned> as caps, cravats, ruffles, or any other
                    such small matters as she can best fly with, from off the hedges where they are
                    hanged to dry after washing, and carry them to her nest, and there leave them,
                    if possible to move the pity of the first comer, to cut the thread, and ease
                    them of their misery. Hence the proverb, ‘When the kite builds, look to lesser
                    linen.’ But, saith Autolycus, I fly at higher game, or larger linen; my traffic

                </cit> The late Joseph Hunter, in his <title>Essay on the Tempest,</title> maintains
                that here<quote><mentioned>line</mentioned></quote> means a linden or lime-tree. But

                If no other objections could be urged against Mr. Hunter's acceptation of the word
                  <mentioned>line,</mentioned> we surely have a decisive one in the joke of

                  <mentioned>line</mentioned> was a <mentioned>hairline.</mentioned> Mr. Knight
                  observes:<quote>In a woodcut of twelve distinct figures of trades and callings of

                    meant in a preceding speech. Both sayings were probably founded upon such
                    fanciful notions as make up a great part of natural history among the common
                    people; but Holland's <title>Pliny</title> warrants the notion that some fishes
                    breed fleas and lice, [Book ix.] ch. xlvii. [This passage of Pliny was first
                    referred to by Reed, <title>Shakspeare,</title> ed. 1785.] Had the Carrier meant
                    to say ‘as big as a <mentioned>loach,</mentioned>’ he would have said ‘breeds
                    fleas like <mentioned>loaches.</mentioned>’ Warburton and Capell are far from
                    the mark. Mr. Malone's suggestion, that it may mean ‘breeds fleas as fast as a
                      <mentioned>loach</mentioned> breeds,’ that is, breeds loaches, is not
                    improbable, as it was reckoned a peculiarly prolific fish.</quote>

                    the same fable: <lb/> ‘ Strange affection! <lb/>Cupid once more hath chang'd his
                    shafts with Death, <lb/>And kills, instead of giving life.’<lb/> Mr. Gifford has
                    illustrated this passage by quoting one of the <title>Elegies</title> of Joannes
                    Secundus. The fiction is probably of Italian origin. Sandford, in his
                      <title>Garden of Pleasure,</title> 1576, has ascribed it to Alciato, and has
                    given that poet's verses, to which he has added a metrical translation of his
                    own. Shirley has formed a masque upon this story, <title>Cupid and

                    3], which at once furnished him with the character of Falconbridge, and ascribed
                    the death of Richard I. to the Duke of Austria. In the person of Austria he has
                    conjoined the two well-known enemies of Cœur-de-lion [following the old play,
                    where Austria is called Lymoges, the Austrich Duke]. Leopold, Duke of Austria,
                    threw him into prison, in a former expedition [in 1193]; but the castle of
                    Chaluz, before which he fell [in 1199], belonged to Vidomar, Viscount of
                    Limoges; and the archer who pierced his shoulder with an arrow (of which wound
                    he died) was Bertrand de Gourdon. The editors seem hitherto to have understood
                    Lymoges as being an appendage to the title of Austria, and therefore inquired no
                    further about it</quote>

                  <quote>The real name of the woman whom I suppose to have been meant by Sir Toby,
                    was Mary Frith. The appellation by which she was generally known was Mall
                    Cutpurse. She was at once an hermaphrodite, a prostitute, a bawd, a bully, a
                    thief, a receiver of stolen goods, etc. On the books of the Stationers' Company,
                    August 1610, is entered —‘A Booke called the Madde Prancks of Merry Mall of the
                    Bankside, with her Walks in Man's Apparel, and to what Purpose. Written by John
                    Day.’ Middleton and Decker wrote a comedy, of which she is the heroine. In this
                    they have given a very flattering representation of her, as they observe in
                    their preface, that ‘it is the excellency of a writer, to leave things better
                    than he finds them.’ The title of this piece is <title>The Roaring Girle. Or
                      Moll CutPurse. As it hath lately beene acted on the Fortune-stage by the
                      Prince his Players,</title> 1611. The frontispiece to it contains a full
                    length of her in man's clothes, smoking tobacco. Nathaniel Field, in his
                      <title>Amends for Ladies,</title> another comedy, 1618, gives the following
                    character of her: <lb/> ‘Hence, lewd impudent! <lb/>I know not what to term
                    thee, man or woman; <lb/>For nature, shaming to acknowledge thee <lb/>For
                    either, hath produc'd thee to the world <lb/>Without a sex: some say thou art a
                    woman; <lb/>Others, a man; and many, thou art both <lb/>Woman and man; but I
                    think rather, neither; <lb/>Or man and horse, as th' old Centaúrs were
                    feign'd’<lb/> [a passage very inaccurately cited in Steevens's note
                      <mentioned>apud</mentioned> the <title>Var. Shakespeare</title>]. A life of
                    this woman was likewise published, 12mo, in 1662, with her portrait before it in
                    a male habit; an ape, a lion, and an eagle by her [<title>The Life and Death of

                  <quote>Mary Frith was born in 1584, and died in 1659. [According to the author of
                    her <title>Life,</title> she was born in 1589. A Ms. in the Brit. Museum, quoted
                    in a note on Dodsley's <title>Old Plays,</title> vol. xii. p. 398, ed. 1780,
                    states that she died at her house in Fleet Street, July 26, 1659, and was buried
                    in the church of Saint Bridget's; which date, however, seems inconsistent with
                    the statement of Mr. Cunningham that she was buried August 10, 1659. Granger
                    says that her death took place in her 75th year.] In a Ms. letter in the British
                    Museum, from John Chamberlain to Mr. [Sir Dudley] Carleton, dated Feb. 11 [12],
                    1611-12, the following ac count is given of this woman's doing penance: ‘This
                    last Sunday Moll Cutpurse, a notorious baggage, that used to go in man's
                    apparel, and challenged the field of diverse gallants, was brought to the same
                    place [St. Paul's Cross], where she wept bitterly, and seemed very penitent; but
                    it is since doubted she was maudlin drunk, being discovered to have tippel'd of
                    [off] three quarts of sack before she came to her penance. She had the daintiest
                    preacher or ghostly father that ever I saw in the pulpit, one Radcliffe of
                    Brazen-Nose College [<quote>College</quote> not in orig.] in Oxford, a likelier
                    man to have led the revels in some inn-ofcourt than to be where he was. But the
                    best is, he did extreme badly, and so wearied the audience, that the best part
                    went away, and the rest tarried rather to hear Moll Cutpurse than him’</quote>

                    groans of so pernicious a nature, that the person who committed the violence
                    went mad or died. To escape that danger, it was recommended to tie one end of a
                    string to the plant and the other to a dog, upon whom the fatal groan would then
                    discharge its whole malignity. See Bulleine's <title>Bulwarke of Defence against
                      Sicknesse,</title> p. 41. These strange notions arose, probably, from the
                    little less fanciful comparison of the root to the human figure, strengthened,
                    doubtless, in England by the accidental circumstance of
                      <mentioned>man</mentioned> being the first syllable of the word. The ancients,
                    however, made the same comparison of its form: <lb/> ‘Quamvis
                      <mentioned>semihominis,</mentioned> vesano gramine fœta, <lb/>Mandragoræ
                    pariat flores.’ <lb/>Columella, <mentioned>de l. [Cult.] Hort.</mentioned> v.
                    19.<lb/> The white mandrake, which they called the male, was that whose root
                    bore this resemblance. Lyte says of it, ‘The roote is great and white, not muche
                    unlyke a radishe roote, divided into two or three partes, and sometimes growing
                    one upon another, almost lyke the thighes and legges of a man.’ <title>Transl.
                      of Dodoens,</title> p. 437. Here it is supposed to cause death: <lb/>‘Would
                    curses kill, as doth the <mentioned>mandrake's</mentioned> groan, <lb/>I would
                    invent,’ etc. <lb/><title>2 Henry VI.</title>, iii. 2. 310.<lb/> Here only
                    madness: <lb/>‘And shrieks like <mentioned>mandrakes</mentioned> torn out of the
                    earth, <lb/>That living mortals hearing them run mad.’ <lb/><lb/><title>Romeo
                      and Juliet,</title> iv. 3. 47.<lb/> A very diminutive or grotesque figure was
                    often compared to a mandrake, that is, to the root, as above described;
                    <lb/>‘Thou whoreson <mentioned>mandrake,</mentioned> thou art fitter to be worn
                    in my <lb/>cap than to wait at my heels.’ <lb/><title>2 Henry IV.</title>, i. 2.
                    14.<lb/> It was sometimes considered as an emblem of incontinence; probably
                    because it resembled only the lower parts of a man; <lb/>‘Yet lecherous as a
                    monkey, and the whores called him <mentioned>mandrake.</mentioned> ’

                  <quote>Manningtree, in Essex, formerly enjoyed the privilege of fairs, by the
                    tenure of exhibiting a certain number of stage-plays yearly. It appears also,
                    from other intimations, that there were great festivities there, and much good
                    eating, at Whitsun ales and other times; we may therefore conclude safely that
                    roasting an ox whole, a very old and established piece of British magnificence,
                    was not uncommon on those occasions. . . . We may further remark, that
                      <mentioned>Manningtree oxen</mentioned> were doubtless at all times famous for
                    their size. Such are the cattle throughout the county, and the pastures of
                    Manningtree are said by Mr. Steevens, an Essex man, to be remarkable.</quote>

                  <quote>The measures were dances solemn and slow. They were performed at court, and
                    at public entertainments of the societies of law and equity, at their halls, on
                    particular occasions. It was formerly not deemed inconsistent with propriety
                    even for the gravest persons to join in them; and accordingly at the revels
                    which were celebrated at the inns of court, it has not been unusual for the
                    first characters in the law to become performers in <mentioned>treading the
                      measures.</mentioned> See Dugdale's <title>Origines Juridiciales.</title> Sir
                    John Davies, in his poem called <title>Orchestra,</title> 1622, describes them
                    in this manner: <lb/>‘But after these, as men more civil grew, <lb/>He [Love]

                    fair order and proportion true, <lb/>And correspondence every way the same,
                    <lb/>That no fault-finding eye did ever blame,<lb/> For every eye was moved at
                    the sight, <lb/>With sober wond'ring and with sweet delight. <lb/>Not those

                    <lb/>Which on the stars did all their life-time look, <lb/>Could ever find such
                    measure in the skies, <lb/>So full of change and rare varieties;
                      <lb/><mentioned>Yet all the feet whereon these measures go, <lb/>Are only

                  1. 92.</bibl> The nick-name of an Italian (not, I believe, of an Englishman, as
                Nares states in his <title>Gloss.,</title> misled by an error of Steevens to be
                noticed presently), who attracted a great deal of attention, and is very frequently
                mentioned by English writers of the time. This crack-brained personage, it appears,
                lived about the court, asserted that he was the sovereign of the world, and (like
                Thrasylaus—or Thrasyllus—see Athenæus, B. xii. sect. 81) fancied that all the ships
                which came into port belonged to him. That he was dead in 1580 is shown by the
                following lines in Churchyard's <title>Chance,</title> which was published during
                that year: <lb/><cit>

                </cit> I will now point out the mistake of Steevens, which I have above referred to.
                He says: <quote>In Nash's <title>Have with you to Saffron-Walden,</title> etc.,
                  1595[6], I meet with the same allusion [that is, an allusion to Monarcho]: ‘but
                  now he was an insulting monarch, above <mentioned>Monarcho</mentioned> the
                  Italian, who ware crownes in his shoes, and quite renounced his natural English
                  accents and gestures, and wrested himself wholly to the Italian punctilios,’
                  etc.</quote> But the complete passage of Nash's very powerful and most amusing
                attack on Gabriel Harvey runs thus: <quote>—it pleased her Highnes [Queen Elizabeth]
                  to say (as in my former Booke I haue cyted) that he [Gabriel Harvey] lookt
                  something like an Italian. No other incitement he needed to rouze his plumes,
                  pricke vp his eares, and run away with the bridle betwixt his teeth, and take it
                  vpon him; (of his owne originall ingrafted disposition theretoo he wanting no
                  aptnes) but now he was an insulting Monarch aboue <mentioned>Monarcha</mentioned>
                  the Italian, that ware crownes on his shooes; and quite renounst his naturall
                  English accents &amp; gestures, and wrested himselfe wholy to the Italian
                  puntilios, speaking our homely Iland tongue strangely,</quote>
                
                <bibl>Sig. M 2, ed. 1596.</bibl> Surely, it is manifest that the latter part of the
                preceding quotation, <quote>and quite renounst his naturall English,</quote> etc.,
                refers to Gabriel Harvey, and not, as Steevens supposed, to Monarcho. </entryFree>
              <p>Those commentators are quite mistaken who fancy that there is an allusion to the

                    cup of ale, and having brought it to his majesty, drank some of it himself, to
                    induce the king to taste it, and soon afterwards expired. Thomas Wykes is the

                      <mentioned>Moorfields,</mentioned> together with the adjoining manor of
                    Finsbury or Fensbury, extending as far as Hoxton, was in the fourteenth century
                    one continued marsh, passable only by rude causeways here and there raised upon
                    it. <mentioned>Moorfields,</mentioned> in the time of Edward II., let but for
                    four marks per annum, a sum then equal in value to six pounds sterling. In 1414,
                    a postern gate, called <mentioned>Moorgate,</mentioned> was opened in London
                    Wall, by Sir Thomas Fauconer, mayor, affording freer access to the city for such
                    as crossed the <mentioned>Moor;</mentioned> and water-courses from it were
                    begun. In 1511, regular dikes, and bridges of communication over them, were made
                    for more effectually draining this fenny tract, during the mayoralty of Robert
                    Atchely; which draining was gradually proceeded upon for about a century, till,
                    in Dekker's day, it would appear that the waters were collected in one great
                      <mentioned>ditch.</mentioned> In 1614, it was to a certain degree levelled,
                    and laid out into walks. In 1732, or between that and 1740, its level was
                    perfected, and the walks planted with elms. After this, the spot was for years
                    neglected, and <mentioned>Moorfields</mentioned> became an assemblage of petty
                    shops, particularly booksellers', and of ironmongers' stalls; till, in the year
                    1790, the handsome square of Finsbury compleated arose upon its site.</quote>

                  <quote>It is objected that Shakespeare [the unknown author of the present play]
                    has varied from the truth of history, to introduce this scene between Mortimer
                    and Richard Plantagenet; as the former served under Henry V. in 1422, and died
                      <mentioned>unconfined</mentioned> in <mentioned>Ireland,</mentioned> in 1424.
                    In the third year of Henry the Sixth, 1425, and during the time that Peter Duke
                    of Coimbra was entertained in London, ‘Edmonde Mortimer (says Hall) the last
                    erle of Marche of that name (<mentioned>which long tyme had bene restrayned from
                      hys liberty,</mentioned> and fynally waxed lame) disceased without yssue,
                    whose inheritance descended to lord Richard Plantagenet,’ etc. Holinshed has the
                    same words; and these authorities, though the fact be otherwise, are sufficient
                    to prove that Shakespeare, or whoever was the author of the play, did not
                    intentionally vary from the truth of history to introduce the present scene. The
                    historian does not, indeed, expressly say that the Earl of March died in the
                      <mentioned>Tower;</mentioned> but one cannot reasonably suppose that he meant
                    to relate an event which he knew had happened to a <mentioned>free
                      man</mentioned> in <mentioned>Ireland,</mentioned> as happening to a
                      <mentioned>prisoner</mentioned> during the time that a particular person was
                    in <mentioned>London.</mentioned> But, wherever he meant to lay the scene of
                    Mortimer's death, it is clear that the author of this play understood him as
                    representing it to have happened in a <mentioned>London prison;</mentioned> an
                    idea, if indeed his words will bear any other construction, a preceding passage

                  <quote>It is presumed that the person intended is Edmund, last Earl of March, and
                    Shakspeare [the unknown author of the present play] was led by Holinshed into
                    the mistake of making him a prisoner. He had, on the contrary, been favoured by
                    Henry the Fifth, and, though he was so far implicated in the treason of
                    Cambridge, Scrope, and Grey, . . . as to have received a pardon from the king,
                    he was summoned as one of the judges to whom the cases of Cambridge and Scrope
                    (being peers) were referred; and there is no notice of his being again under
                    suspicion, or out of favour, in the last reign or in the present. He died in the
                    year 1424 or 1425, not in the Tower, but in Ireland [He <quote>died of the
                      plague in his castle at Trim in January 1424-5,</quote>
                    <bibl>MALONE</bibl> ]. There is another mistake in making him an old
                    man; he died at the age of twenty-four, or thereabouts.</quote>

                    Malone and others have fallen into the same error] in supposing that the Edmund

                    Mortimer, Earl of March, whom King Richard had proclaimed heir to the crown, and
                    who was, according to hereditary right, now entitled to it. The Earl of March
                    was at this time a child. It was his uncle, Sir Edward Mortimer (second son of
                    the first Earl of March) whose adventures Shakespeare relates and misapplies.

                  <quote>The true reason why this Saint was chosen to be the patron of Scholars may
                    be gathered from the following story in his Life composed in French verse by
                      <mentioned>Maitre Wace,</mentioned> chaplain to Henry the Second, remaining in
                    manuscript but never printed. . . . <lb/> ‘Treis clers aloent a escole <lb/>Nen
                    frai mie longe parole,’ etc., etc. That is, ‘Three scholars were on their way to
                    school (I shall not make a long story of it), their host murdered them in the
                    night, and hid their bodies; their [a word defaced in the manuscript] he
                    reserved. Saint Nicholas was informed of it by God Almighty, and according to
                    his pleasure went to the place. He demanded the scholars of the host, who was
                    not able to conceal them, and therefore showed them to him. Saint Nicholas by
                    his prayers restored the souls to their bodies. Because he conferred such honour
                    on scholars, they at this day celebrate a festival.’ It is remarkable that
                    although the above story explains the common representation of the saint with
                    three children in a tub, it is not to be found in that grand repertory of
                    Monkish lies, <title>The golden legend.</title> It occurs, however, in an
                    Italian Life of Saint Nicholas printed in 1645, whence it is extracted into the

                    the morris or merrils was known during the time that the Normans continued in
                    possession of England, and that the name was afterwards corrupted into

                </cit>. <quote>Merelles, or, as it was formerly called in England, nine mens morris,
                  and also fivepenny morris, is a game of some antiquity. Cotgrave describes it as a
                  boyish game, and says it was played here commonly with stones, but in France with
                  pawns, or men, made on purpose, and they were termed merelles; hence the pastime
                  itself received that denomination. It was certainly much used by the shepherds
                  formerly, and continues to be used by them and other rustics to the present hour.
                  But it is very far from being confined to the practice of boys and girls. The form
                  of the merelletable, and the lines upon it, as it appeared in the fourteenth
                  century, is given upon the thirtieth plate; and these lines have not been varied.
                  The black spots at every angle and intersection of the lines are the places for
                  the men to be laid upon; and the manner of playing is briefly this: two persons,
                  having each of them nine pieces, or men [<hi rend="ital">Note.</hi> Which are
                  different in form or colour for distinction sake; and from the moving these men
                  backwards or forwards, as though they were dancing a morris, I suppose the pastime
                  received the appellation of Nine Men's Morris. But why it should have been called
                  fivepenny morris, I do not know], lay them down alternately, one by one, upon the
                  spots; and the business of either party is to prevent his antagonist from placing
                  three of his pieces so as to form a row of three, without the intervention of an
                  opponent piece. If a row be formed, he that made it is at liberty to take up one
                  of his competitor's pieces from any part he thinks most to his own advantage. [<hi rend="ital">Note.</hi> Excepting he has made a row, which must not be touched if
                  he have another piece upon the board that is not a component part of that row.]
                  When all the pieces are laid down, they are played backwards and forwards, in any
                  direction that the lines run, but can only move from one spot to another at one
                  time: he that takes off all his antagonist's pieces is the conqueror. The rustics,
                  when they have not materials at hand to make a table, cut the lines in the same
                  form upon the ground, and make a small hole for every dot. They then collect, as
                  above mentioned, stones of different forms or colours for the pieces, and play the
                  game by depositing them in the holes in the same manner that they are set over the
                  dots upon the table. Hence Shakespeare, describing the effects of a wet and stormy
                  season [in the present passage],</quote>

                  <quote>In that part of Warwickshire where Shakespeare was educated, and the
                    neighbouring parts of Northamptonshire, the shepherds and other boys dig up the
                    turf with their knives to represent a sort of imperfect chess-board. It consists
                    of a square, sometimes only a foot diameter, sometimes three or four yards.
                    Within this is another square, every side of which is parallel to the external
                    square; and these squares are joined by lines drawn from each corner of both
                    squares, and the middle of each line. One party, or player, has wooden pegs, the
                    other stones, which they move in such a manner as to take up each other's men,
                    as they are called, and the area of the inner square is called the pound, in
                    which the men taken up are impounded. These figures are by the country people
                    called <mentioned>Nine Men's Morris</mentioned> or
                      <mentioned>Merrils;</mentioned> and are so called because each party has nine
                    men. These figures are always cut upon the green turf, or leys as they are
                    called, or upon the grass at the end of ploughed lands, and in rainy seasons
                    never fail to be <mentioned>choked [fill'd] up with mud</mentioned></quote>

                    two persons take each nine stones, which they place by turns in the angles, and
                    afterwards move alternately, as at chess or draughts. He who can place three in
                    a straight line may then take off any one of his adversary's, where he pleases,
                    till one, having lost all his men, loses the game</quote>

                  <quote>This term [<mentioned>noise</mentioned>], which occurs perpetually in our
                    old dramatists, means a <mentioned>company</mentioned> or
                      <mentioned>concert.</mentioned> In Jonson's days they sedulously attended
                    taverns, ordinaries, etc., and seem to have been very importunate for admission
                    to the guests. They usually consisted of three, and took their name from the
                    leader of their little band. Thus we hear of ‘Mr. Sneak's
                      <mentioned>noise,</mentioned>’ ‘Mr. Creak's <mentioned>noise,</mentioned>’
                    and, in Cartwright, of ‘Mr. Spindle's <mentioned>noise.</mentioned>’ These names
                    are probably the invention of Shakespeare and the rest; but they prove the
                    existence of the custom. When this term went out of use, I cannot tell; but it
                    was familiar in Dryden's time, who has it in his <title>Wild Gallant</title> and
                    elsewhere: ‘I hear him coming, and a whole <mentioned>noise</mentioned> of

                    may be; but Grimm quotes no other authority for the word than Shakespeare. He

                  <quote>This is a common story among the vulgar in Gloucestershire, and is thus
                    related: ‘Our Saviour went into a baker's shop where they were baking, and asked
                    for some bread to eat. The mistress of the shop immediately put a piece of dough
                    into the oven to bake for him; but was reprimanded by her daughter, who
                    insisting that the piece of dough was too large, reduced it to a very small
                    size. The dough, however, immediately afterwards began to swell, and presently
                    became of a most enormous size. Whereupon the baker's daughter cried out
                      <quote>Heugh, heugh, heugh;</quote> which owl-like noise probably induced our
                    Saviour for her wickedness to transform her into that bird.’ The story is often
                    related to children, in order to deter them from such illiberal behaviour to
                    poor people</quote>

                </cit> (<cit>
                  <quote>It has been supposed that this term [<mentioned>patch</mentioned>]
                    originated from the name of a fool belonging to Cardinal Wolsey, and that his
                    parti-coloured dress was given to him in allusion to his name. The objection to
                    this is, that the motley habit worn by fools is much older than the time of
                    Wolsey. Again, it appears that <mentioned>Patch</mentioned> was an appellation
                    given not to one fool only that belonged to Wolsey. There is an epigram by
                    Heywood, entitled <title>A saying of Patch my Lord Cardinal's foole;</title> but
                    in the epigram itself he is twice called <mentioned>Sexten,</mentioned> which
                    was his real name. In a manuscript Life of Wolsey by his gentleman usher
                    Cavendish [now well known from the printed copy] there is a story of another
                    fool belonging to the Cardinal, and presented by him to the King. A marginal
                    note states that ‘this foole was callid <mentioned>Master Williames,</mentioned>
                    owtherwise called <mentioned>Patch.</mentioned>’ In Heylin's <title>History of
                      the Reformation</title> mention is made of another fool called
                      <mentioned>Patch</mentioned> belonging to Elizabeth. But the name is even
                    older than Wolsey's time; for in some household accounts of Henry the Seventh
                    there are payments to a fool who is named <mentioned>Pechie</mentioned> and
                      <mentioned>Packye.</mentioned> It seems therefore more probable on the whole
                    that fools were nick-named <mentioned>Patch</mentioned> from their dress; unless
                    there happen to be a nearer affinity to the Italian
                      <mentioned>pazzo,</mentioned> a word that has all the appearance of a descent
                    from <mentioned>fatuus.</mentioned> This was the opinion of Mr. Tyrwhitt in a
                    note on <title>A Midsummer-Night's Dream,</title> iii. 2. 9. But although in the
                    above instance [‘The <mentioned>patch</mentioned> is kind enough,’—<title>The
                      Merchant of Venice,</title> ii. 5. 45], as well as in a multitude of others, a
                      <mentioned>patch</mentioned> denotes a fool or simpleton, and, by corruption,
                    a clown, it seems to have been occasionally used in the sense of <mentioned>any
                      low or mean person.</mentioned> Thus in the passage in <title>A
                      Midsummer-Night's Dream</title> just referred to, Puck calls Bottom and his
                    companions <mentioned>a crew of patches, rude mechanicals,</mentioned> certainly
                    not meaning to compare them to pampered and sleek buffoons. Whether in this
                    sense the term have a simple reference to that class of people whose clothes
                    might be pieced or <mentioned>patched</mentioned> with rags; or whether it is to
                    be derived from the Saxon verb <mentioned>pæcan,</mentioned> to deceive by false
                    appearances, as suggested by the acute and in genious author of <title>The

                  <quote>This hero was Uther Pendragon, brother to Aurelius, and father to King
                    Arthur. Shakespeare [the unknown author of this play] has imputed to Pendragon
                    an exploit of Aurelius, who, says Holinshed, ‘even sicke of a flixe as he was,
                    caused himselfe to be carried forth in a litter: with whose presence his people
                    were so incouraged, that encountering with the Saxons they wan the victorie.’

                  <quote>our poet followed the author of <title>The Destruction of Troy</title> [see

                    edition], a book which furnished him with some other circumstances of this play.
                    Of the horse alluded to in the text he found in that book the following account:
                    ‘Of the blood that issued out [from Medusa's head] there engendered Pegasus, or
                    the <mentioned>flying horse.</mentioned> By the flying horse that was engendered
                    of the blood issued from her head, is understood, that of her riches issuing of
                    that realme he [Perseus] founded and made a <mentioned>ship</mentioned> named
                    Pegase,—and <mentioned>this ship was likened unto an horse flying,</mentioned>’
                    etc. Again, ‘By this fashion Perseus conquered the head of Medusa, and did make
                    Pegase, the most swift ship that was in all the world.’ In another place the
                    same writer assures us, that this ship, which he always calls Perseus' flying
                    horse, ‘flew on the sea like unto a bird.’ <title>Dest. of Troy,</title> 4to,

                  <quote>But though classic authority be wanting that Perseus made use of a horse,
                    Boccaccio in his <title>Genealogia Deorum,</title> lib. xii. c. 25, has quoted
                    Lactantius as saying, that when Perseus undertook his expedition against Gorgon,
                    at the instance of king Polydectus, he was accompanied by the winged horse
                    Pegasus, but not that he used him in delivering Andromeda. Boccaccio adds, that
                    others were of opinion that he had a <mentioned>ship</mentioned> called Pegasus.
                    The liberties which the old French translators of Ovid's
                      <title>Metamorphoses</title> have taken, and their interpolations, are
                    unaccountable. Some have caused Perseus at the instant of his birth to bestride
                    Pegasus, and travel away to Helicon. In the cuts to many of the early editions
                    of Ovid, the designers have not only placed him on Pegasus in the adventure with
                    Andromeda, but even in his attack upon Atlas</quote>

                    perspective, or odd kind of ‘pictures upon an indented board, which, if beheld
                    directly, you only perceive a confused piece of work; but, if obliquely, you see
                    the intended person's picture;’ which, he was told, was made thus: ‘The board
                    being indented [or furrowed with a plough-plane], the print or painting was cut
                    into parallel pieces equal to the depth and number of the indentures on the
                    board, and they were pasted on the flats that strike the eye holding it
                    obliquely, so that the edges of the parallel pieces of the print or painting
                    exactly joining on the edges of the indentures, the work was done’</quote>

                  WINDSOR, ii. 2. 16.</bibl> In spite of all that has been written about this
                celebrated re treat of prostitutes and thieves,—from the earliest notes on
                Shakespeare down to Mr. P. Cunningham's <title>Hand-book for London,</title>—it
                would seem that the exact position of <mentioned>Pickt-hatch</mentioned> remains to
                be determined. <cit>
                  <quote>In Shakespeare's time, that portion of London which is now bounded on the
                    North by Old Street, on the East by Golding Lane, on the South by Barbican, and
                    on the West by Goswell Street and the Charter-house, consisted for the most part
                    of scattered collections of small tenements, generally with gardens attached to
                    them, and a few alleys or courts. Somewhere in this small portion of the
                    metropolis was situated the notorious resort of bad characters, which was known
                    as the Pickt-hatch; that name, it is conjectured, being derived from the iron
                    spikes placed over the halfdoor, or hatch, one of the characteristics of a house
                    of illfame, etc. etc. </quote>

                    It was probably found convenient to detach this spike occasionally; for

                      <title>1 Henry VI.,</title> iii. 1. 103], it must be remembered that before
                    beginning a battle it was customary for the archers and other footmen to
                    encompass themselves with sharp stakes firmly pitched in the ground, to prevent
                    their being overpowered by the cavalry. Thus, in a previous speech, i. 1.
                    115-119,<lb/> ‘No leisure had he to enrank his men; <lb/>He wanted pikes to set

                95) is more than I can determine. It has been very variously explained—a petticoat,
                an under-petticoat, a pocket attached to a petticoat, the slit or opening in a
                petticoat, and a stomacher; and it certainly was occasionally used to signify a

                    years since maids began to wear plackets.’ According to Middleton, the placket
                    is ‘the open part’ of a petticoat; and the word is not altogether obsolete,
                    since the opening in the petticoats of the present day is still called ‘the

                  <bibl> ROMEO AND JULIET, i. 4. 89.</bibl>
                </cit> According to Douce, this <quote>alludes to a very singular superstition not
                  yet forgotten in some parts of the country. It was believed that certain malignant
                  spirits, whose delight was to wander in groves and pleasant places, assumed
                  occasionally the likenesses of women clothed in white; that in this character they
                  sometimes haunted stables in the night-time, carrying in their hands tapers of
                  wax, which they dropped on the horses' manes, thereby plaiting them in
                  inextricable knots, to the great annoyance of the poor animals and vexation of
                  their masters. These hags are mentioned in the works of William of Auvergne,
                  bishop of Paris in the 13th century,</quote> etc. <pb n="118"/>

                    I take it that it is called Primera because it hath the first place at the play
                    at cardes. R. Let vs goe: what is the summe that we play for? M. Two shillings
                    stake, and eight shillings rest. L. Then shuffle the cardes well. O. I lift to
                    see who shall deale: it must be a coate carde; I would not be a coat with neuer
                    a blanke in my purse. R. I did lift an ace. L. I a fower. M. I a sixe, whereby I
                    am the eldest hand. O. Let the cardes come to me, for I deale them; one, two,
                    three, fower, one, two, three, fower. M. Passe. R. Passe. L. Passe. O. I set so
                    much. M. I will none. R. Ile none. L. I must of force see it; deale the cards.
                    M. Giue me fower cards; Ile see as much as he sets. R. See heere my rest; let
                    euery one be in. M. I am come to passe againe. R. And I too. L. I do the selfe
                    same. O. I set my rest. M. Ile see it. R. I also. L. I cannot giue it ouer. M. I
                    was a small prime. L. I am flush. M. I would you were not. L. Is this good
                    neighbourhood? M. Charitie well placed doth first beginne with ones selfe. O. I
                    made fiue and fiftie, with which I win his prime. L. I flush, whereby I draw. R.
                    I play no more at this play. M. Neither I at any other, for I must goe about a
                    busines that concernes me. L. Pages, take euerie one two shillings a peece of
                    the winnings. P. I pray God you may receiue it a hundred fold. P. In heauen I
                    pray God you may finde it hanged on a hooke.</quote>

                    high antiquity, and antecedent, I doubt not, to the justs and tournaments. The
                    quintain originally was nothing more than the trunk of a tree or post set up for
                    the practice of the tyros in chivalry. Afterward a staff or spear was fixed in
                    the earth, and a shield, being hung upon it, was the mark to strike at. The
                    dexterity of the performer consisted in smiting the shield in such a manner as
                    to break the ligatures and bear it to the ground. In process of time this
                    diversion was improved, and instead of the staff and the shield, the resemblance
                    of a human figure carved in wood was introduced. To render the appearance of
                    this figure more formidable, it was generally made in the likeness of a Turk or
                    a Saracen armed at all points, bearing a shield upon his left arm, and
                    brandishing a club or a sabre with his right. The quintain thus fashioned was
                    placed upon a pivot, and so contrived as to move round with facility. In running
                    at this figure it was necessary for the horseman to direct his lance with great
                    adroitness, and make his stroke upon the forehead between the eyes or upon the
                    nose; for if he struck wide of those parts, especially upon the shield, the
                    quintain turned about with much velocity, and, in case he was not exceedingly
                    careful, would give him a severe blow upon the back with the wooden sabre held
                    in the right hand, which was considered as highly disgraceful to the performer,
                    while it excited the laughter and ridicule of the spectators.</quote>

                    wanting. The reason given by some of the old writers for such a deficiency is,
                    that though the hands and feet, by an easy change, might be converted into the
                    four paws of a beast, there was still no part about a woman which corresponded

                from <mentioned>rivo</mentioned> (also <mentioned>rio</mentioned>)
                  <mentioned>alto</mentioned>—is one of the largest of the islands on which Venice
                is built, and the first where the foundations of the city were laid; but Shakespeare
                alludes to the Exchange in the Rialto, described as follows by Coryat: <cit>
                  <quote>The Rialto, which is at the farther side of the bridge as you come from St.
                    Marks, is a most stately building, being the Exchange of Venice, where the
                    Venetian gentlemen and the merchants doe meete twice a day, betwixt eleuen and
                    twelue of the clocke in the morning, and betwixt fiue and sixe of the clocke in
                    the afternoone. This Rialto is of a goodly height, built all with bricke as the
                    palaces are, adorned with many faire walkes or open galleries that I haue before
                    mentioned, and hath a prety quadrangular court adioyning to it. But it is
                    inferiour to our Exchange in London, though indeede there is a farre greater
                    quantity of building in this then in ours.</quote>

                  <quote>Rialto is the name, not of the bridge, but of the island from which it is
                    called; and the Venetians say il ponte di Rialto, as we say Westminster-bridge.
                    In that island is the exchange; and I have often walked there as on classic
                    ground. In the days of Antonio and Bassanio it was second to none. ‘I
                    sottoportichi,’ says Sansovino, writing in 1580, ‘sono ogni giorno frequentati
                    da i mercatanti Fiorentini, Genovesi, Milanesi, Spagnuoli, Turchi, e d' altre
                    nationi diverse del mondo, i quali vi concorrono in tanta copia, che questa
                    piazza è annoverata fra le prime dell' universo.’ It was there that the
                    Christian held discourse with the Jew; and Shylock refers to it, when he says,
                    <lb/>‘Sign&lt;*&gt;r Antonio, many a time and oft <lb/>In the Rialto you have
                    rated me;’<lb/> ‘Andiamo a Rialto'— ‘L’ ora di Rialto’—were on every tongue; and
                    continue so to the present day, as we learn from the comedies of Goldoni, and
                    particularly from his Mercanti.</quote>

                  <quote>Shakespeare here alludes to the old metrical romance of <mentioned>Richard
                      Cæur-de-lion,</mentioned> wherein this once celebrated monarch is related to
                    have acquired his distinguishing appellation by having plucked out a lion's
                    heart, to whose fury he was exposed by the Duke of Austria, for having slain his
                    son with a blow of his fist. From this ancient romance the story has crept into
                    some of our old chronicles; but the original passage may be seen at large in the

                    Rycharde, beynge in prison, to have devoured hym, and when the lyon was gapynge,
                    he put his arme in his mouthe, and pulled the lyon by the harte so harde, that

                  <quote>This does not solely refer to the business of rivetting the plate armour
                    before it was put on, but as to part, when it was on. Thus the top of the
                    cuirass had a little projecting bit of iron, that passed through a hole pierced
                    through the bottom of the casque. When both were put on, the smith or armourer
                    presented himself, with his rivetting hammer, <mentioned>to close the rivet
                      up;</mentioned> so that the party's head should remain steady notwithstanding
                    the force of any blow that might be given on the cuirass or helmet. This custom
                    more particularly prevailed in tournaments. See <title>Variétés

                <quote>The allusion is to an ancient practice of marrying with a rush ring, as well
                  in other countries as in England. Breval [Du Breul], in his <title>Antiquities of
                    Paris,</title> mentions it as a kind of espousal used in France by such persons
                  as meant to live together in a state of concubinage; but in England it was scarce
                  ever practised except by designing men, for the purpose of corrupting those young

                  <quote>With respect to the wines called <mentioned>Sacks,</mentioned> which had
                    now come into general use, much diversity of opinion has prevailed. . . . It
                    seems, indeed, to be admitted, on all hands, that the term
                      <mentioned>Sack</mentioned> was originally applied to certain growths of
                    Spain. . . . Dr. Percy has the credit of restoring the original interpretation
                    of the term. In a manuscript account of the disbursements by the chamberlain of
                    the city of Worcester for the year 1592, he found the ancient mode of spelling
                    to be <mentioned>seck</mentioned> (‘Item, For a gallon of clarett wyne and seck,
                    and a pound of sugar geven to Sir John Russell, iiii<mentioned>s.</mentioned>’),
                    and thence concluded that <mentioned>Sack</mentioned> was merely a corruption of
                      <mentioned>sec,</mentioned> signifying a dry wine. Minshew . . . renders the
                    term <mentioned>vin sec;</mentioned> and Cotgrave, in his Dictionary, gives the
                    same translation. The most satisfactory evidence, however, in support of this
                    opinion, is furnished by the French version of a proclamation for regulating the
                    prices of wines, issued by the privy council in 1633, where the expression
                      <mentioned>vins secs</mentioned> corresponds with the word
                      <mentioned>sacks</mentioned> in the original copy (Rymer's
                      <title>Fœdera,</title> Tom. viii. Part iv. p. 46). It may also be remarked,
                    that the term <mentioned>sec</mentioned> is still used as a substantive by the
                    French, to denote a Spanish wine (‘On dit aussi quelquefois absolument du
                      <mentioned>sec,</mentioned> pour dire, du vin d'Espagne.’ <title>Dict. de
                      Trevoux</title>); and that the dry wine of Xerez is distinguished at the place
                    of its growth by the name of <mentioned>vino seco.</mentioned> These several
                    authorities, then, appear to warrant the inference that Sack was a
                      <mentioned>dry</mentioned> Spanish wine. But, on the other hand, numerous
                    instances occur in which it is mentioned in conjunction with wines of the sweet
                    class. The act of Henry VIII. speaks of ‘sakkes or other swete wynes.’ In like
                    manner, the <title>Mystery of Vintners,</title> published by Dr. Merret in 1675,
                    gives a receipt ‘to correct the rankness and eagerness of wines, as Sack and
                    Malago, or other sweet wines.’ Glas, in his <title>History of the Canary
                      Islands,</title> makes no distinction between Malmsey and Canary Sack; and
                    Nichols, in the account which he has given of Teneriffe, expressly says, ‘that
                    island produces three sorts of excellent wines,—Canary, Malmsey, and Verdona;
                    which all go under the denomination of Sacks’ (Astle's <title>Voyages,</title>
                    vol. i. p. 541). To get rid of the difficulty which thus arises, Mr. Nares [in
                    his <title>Gloss.</title>] has recourse to the supposition, that Sack was a
                    common name for all white wines. But it has been already shown that the
                    appellation was originally confined to the growths of Spain; and if it had been
                    used to designate white wines in general, there can be no reason why it should
                    not have been applied to those of France or Candia, which were then imported in
                    large quantity. If, again, we suppose that the name denoted a sweet wine, we
                    shall be equally at a loss to discover the circumstances which could have given
                    rise to such a distinction between it and the other kinds then in use; not to
                    mention, that such an application of the term would have been wholly at variance
                    with the etymology as above deduced. A more particular examination of the
                    characters assigned to Sack by the few writers who have described it, will
                    perhaps enable us to reconcile these discrepancies, and remove much of the
                    perplexity in which the question has hitherto been involved. In the first place,
                    we are told by Venner, that ‘Sacke is completely hot in the third degree, and of
                    thin parts, and therefore it doth vehemently and quickly heat the body: wherfore
                    the much and untimely use of it doth overheat the liver, inflame the blood, and
                    exsiccate the radical humour in lean and dry bodies’ (<title>Via Recta ad Vitam
                      Longam,</title> p. 22). This description accords with the epithet ‘sprightly,’
                    which is given to it in some verses published in 1641 (<title>Preparative to the
                      Study or Vertue of Sack,</title> 4to, 1641), and sufficiently proves, that it
                    could not have been of a thick luscious quality, like most of the dessert-wines
                    then in vogue. That, however, it was a liquor of considerable strength and body,
                    may be inferred from a subsequent passage of the last-mentioned work, where it
                    is extolled as ‘the elixir of wine;’ an expression apparently borrowed from one
                    of Ben Jonson's plays (<title>Every Man out of his Humour,</title> Prol.
                    [Introductory scene]). Herrick, again, calls it a ‘frantic liquor;’ expatiating,
                    with rapture, on its ‘witching beauties,’ ‘generous blood,’ etc.
                        (<bibl><title>Farewell to Sack,</title> and <title>Welcome to Sack,</title>
                      Herrick's <title>Hesperides,</title> pp. 48, 87</bibl>); and most of the
                    dramatic writings of the age contain frequent allusions to its enlivening
                    virtues and other fascinating properties. Had there been nothing new or uncommon
                    in the nature of the wine, it could hardly have excited such extravagant
                    admiration, or come into such universal request, at a time when our countrymen
                    were already familiar with the choicest vintages from almost all parts of the
                    globe. The practice which prevailed of mixing sugar with Sack has been thought
                    by most persons to indicate a dry wine, such as Rhenish or Sherry. Dr. Drake,
                    indeed, is of a contrary opinion, alleging that there would be no humour in
                    Falstaff's well-known jest on Sack and sugar, if the liquor had not been of the
                    sweet kind (<title>Shakespeare and his Times,</title> vol. ii. p. 130). But on
                    this point little stress can be laid; as at that time it was a general custom
                    with the English to add sugar to their wines (See Fynes Moryson's
                      <title>Itinerary,</title> Part iii. p. 152. Hentzner's <title>Travels,</title>
                    etc.). The testimony of Venner, however, who has discussed the question,
                    ‘whether Sack be best to be taken with sugar or without,’ clearly points to a
                    dry wine. ‘Some,’ he observes, ‘affect to drinke Sacke with sugar, and some
                    without, and upon no other ground, as I thinke, but that, as it is best pleasing
                    to their pallates. I will speake what I deeme thereof, and I thinke I shall well
                    satisfie such as are judicious. Sacke, taken by itself, is very hot, and very
                    penetrative: being taken with sugar, the heat is both somewhat allayed, and the
                    penetrative quality thereof also retardated. Wherefore let this be the
                    conclusion: Sacke taken by itself, without any mixture of sugar, is best for
                    them that have cold stomackes, and subject to the obstructions of it, and of the
                    meseraicke veines. But for them that are free from such obstructions, and fear
                    lest that the drinking of sacke, by reason of the penetrative faculty of it,
                    might distemper the liver, it is best to drinke it with sugar; and so I leave
                    every man that understandeth his owne state of body, to be his own director
                    herein’ (<mentioned>Via</mentioned>
                    <title>Recta ad Vitam Longam,</title> p. 23). A passage in Shakspeare
                      (‘<mentioned>Fal.</mentioned> You rogue, here's lime in this sack too,’<bibl>1 Henry IV., ii. 4. 117</bibl>),
                    which has been thought to allude merely to the adulteration of sack by the
                    vintners, throws, in fact, much light on its genuine qualities; and proves it to
                    be of the same nature as the wines still manufactured, in Spain and other
                    countries, from the ripest grapes, which receive a sprinkling of burnt lime or
                    gypsum, before they are pressed and introduced into the vat. But if any doubt
                    remained on the subject, it would be completely removed by the account which Sir
                    Richard Hawkins gives of these wines. ‘Since the Spanish sacks,’ he observes,
                    ‘have been common in our taverns, which for conservation are mingled with the
                    lime in the making, our nation complains of calentures, of the stone, the
                    dropsy, and infinite other distempers, not heard of before this wine came into
                    common use. Besides, there is no year that it wasteth not two millions of crowns
                    of our substance, by conveyance into foreign countries’ (<title>Observations on
                      a Voyage into the South Sea,</title> London, 1622). It thus becomes manifest,
                    that the sacks which were first imported into England in the reign of Henry
                    VIII., and which had come into general request before the end of the seventeenth
                    century, belonged, as Minshew had correctly defined them, to the class of dry
                    wines, and resembled those liquors which still pass under that denomination. If,
                    indeed, we may credit the statement of Howell, there was one species of sack
                    known at an earlier period, and that was the Romanie. Nor is the fact
                    unimportant in the history of wines; for it not only affords a further
                    explanation of the latter name, but serves to show, that the Spaniards had
                    borrowed from the Greeks the practice of adding gypsum to the must, which they
                    afterwards improved upon, and perfected to such a degree, as to be enabled to
                    excel all other nations in the manufacture of dry wines. It was from the Ionian
                    islands, as we collect from Bacci, that the Romanie originally came: and, at the
                    present day, there is so little difference between the best white wines of
                    Cephalonia and Zante, and some of the vintages of Spain and Portugal, which have
                    been prepared in a similar manner, that a person not much accustomed to observe
                    the nicer shades of distinction among wines might easily mistake the one for the
                    other. Howell mentions a Cephalonian muscadel, that was imported into England in
                    his time: and Fynes Moryson found an excellent white wine at Palormo, in
                    Natolia; ‘which,’ he observes, ‘is like the Spanish sacke, but more pleasant to
                    the taste, being not so sweete as the Canary wines, nor so harsh and strong as
                    the Sherry sacke’ (<title>Itinerary,</title> Part iii. p. 130). Sack was used as
                    a generic name for the wines in question; but occasionally the growths were
                    particularly specified. Thus, in one of the scenes in <title>The Second Part of
                      K. Henry IV.</title> we have a laboured panegyric by Falstaff on the
                    attributes of Sherris-sack, or dry Sherry; and for a long time the words Sack
                    and Sherry were used indiscriminately for each other (Jonson's
                      <title>Bartholomew Fair,</title> act v. sc. 6 [3]; his <title>New Inn,</title>
                    act i. sc. 2 [1]). In like manner we frequently read of Canary Sack, and find
                    the latter term sometimes employed to express that particular wine (Jonson's
                      <title>Staple of News,</title> act v. sc. 4 [2]; Herrick's <title>Welcome to
                      Sack,—Hesperides,</title> p. 86; Heywood and W. Rowley's <title>Fortune by
                      Land and Sea,</title> 1655, p. 4); although it differed materially from Sherry
                    in quality, and scarcely came within the description of a dry wine. ‘Canarie
                    wine,’ says Venner, ‘which beareth the name of the islands from whence it is
                    brought, is of some termed a Sacke, with this adjunct
                      <mentioned>sweete</mentioned> (‘An ocean of sweet Sack.’ Fletcher's
                      <title>Rule a Wife and have a Wife,</title> act v. sc. 5), but yet very
                    improperly, for it differeth not onely from Sacke in sweetnesse and
                    pleasantnesse of taste, but also in colour and consistence: for it is not so
                    white in colour as Sacke, nor so thin in substance; wherefore it is more
                    nutritive than Sacke, and less penetrative. It is best agreeable to cold
                    constitutions, and for old bodies, so that they be not too impensively
                    cholericke: for it is a wine that will quickly enflame, and therefore very
                    hurtfull unto hot and cholericke bodies, especially if they be young’
                      (<title>Via Recta,</title> etc., p. 24). This passage is the more deserving of
                    attention, as it not only illustrates the nature of the Canary wine in use at
                    the commencement of the seventeenth century, but shows that there were
                    considerable differences in the quality of the wines which bore the general name
                    of <mentioned>Sacks,</mentioned> and thus removes much of the confusion that has
                    arisen from the misnomer above alluded to. Whether the Canary Islands then
                    furnished any dry wines, similar to those which are now imported from Teneriffe,
                    seems doubtful; but it is clear, that Canary Sack resembled the liquor which
                    still passes under that denomination. Of the precise degree of sweetness which
                    it possessed, we may form some idea from the observation of Howell, who informs
                    us, that ‘<mentioned>Sherries</mentioned> and <mentioned>Malagas</mentioned>
                    well mingled pass for <mentioned>Canaries</mentioned> in most taverns, more
                    often than Canary itself’ (<title>Familiar Letters,</title> Part ii. Lett. 60).
                    Ben Jonson mentions his receiving a present of Palm-sack, that is, sack from the
                    island of Palma. With these decisive authorities before us, we can readily
                    understand the description which Markham has given of the various kinds of Sack
                    known in his time. ‘Your best Sacks,’ he observes, ‘are of Xeres, in Spain,—your
                    smaller, of Gallicia and Portugall; your strong Sacks are of the islands of the
                    Canaries and of Malligo; and your muskadine and malmseys are of many parts, of
                    Italy, Greece, and some special islands’ (<title>English Housewife,</title> p.
                    118). . . . Judging from what is still observable of some of the wines of Spain,
                    we may easily imagine, that many of the Sacks, properly so called, might, at the
                    same time, be both dry and sweet. At all events, when new, they would belong to
                    the class of sweetish wines; and it was only after having been kept a sufficient
                    length of time, to ensure the decomposition of the greater part of the free
                    saccharine matter contained in them, that they could have acquired the peculiar
                    dryness for which they were distinguished. We find, accordingly, that they were
                    valued in proportion to their age; and the calls for ‘old Sack,’ as Sack
                      <foreign xml:lang="greek">kat) e)zoxh\n</foreign>, were very common (‘Give me
                    Sacke, old Sacke, boys,’ 
                    <bibl><title>Pasquil's Palinodia,</title> 1619</bibl> [?]). We may also presume,
                    that there would be much less difference of taste among the several species of
                    Sack, in their recent state, than after they had been long kept; for even the
                    sweetest wines betray at first some degree of roughness, which is gradually
                    subdued by age; while the character of dryness, on the other hand, will hardly
                    apply to any of the durable wines, as they come from the vat. Mountain and
                    Canary were always sweeter than Sherry; but between the richer kinds there is
                    often a strong resemblance in flavour, which is the less extraordinary, as they
                    are made from the same species of grape, though growing in different soils. It
                    was, therefore, not without reason, that they were considered as ‘near allied’
                    <lb/> (‘Two kinsmen neare allyde to Sherry Sack, <lb/><bibl>Sweet Malligo and
                      delicate Canary.’ <title>Pasquil's Palinodia</title></bibl>. The conclusion at
                    which we thus arrive is so far satisfactory, as it proves that the wines
                    formerly known under the name of <mentioned>Sacks,</mentioned> though they may,
                    upon the whole, have been inferior, yet differed in no essential quality from
                    those with which we are at present supplied by the same countries that
                    originally produced them, and which are still held in such deserved estimation.
                    They probably first came into favour, in consequence of their possessing greater
                    strength and durability, and being more free from acidity, than the white wines
                    of France and Germany; and owed their distinctive appellation to that peculiar
                    subastringent taste which characterizes all wines prepared with gypsum.</quote>

                  <quote>Originally from the <mentioned>Alexandreis</mentioned> of Philippe
                    Gaultier; but several translations of this adage were obvious to Shakespeare [it
                    occurs over and over again in our old writers]. . . . Philippe Gaultier de
                    Chatillon . . . was born towards the latter end of the 12th century. In the
                    Fifth Book of his heroic poem, Darius (who, escaping from Alexander, fell into
                    the hands of Bessus) is thus apostrophized:<lb/> ‘Nactus equum Darius, rorantia
                    cæde suorum <lb/>Retrogrado fugit arva gradu. Quo tendis inertem, <lb/>Rex
                    periture, fugam? nescis, heu! perdite, nescis <lb/>Quem fugias: hostes incurris
                    dum fugis hostem; <lb/><mentioned>Incidis in Scyllam, cupiens vitare
                      Charybdim.</mentioned>’ . . .<lb/> The author of the line in question (who was
                    unknown to Erasmus [see his <title>Adagia,</title> etc., pp. 493-4, ed. 1629])
                    was first ascertained by Galeottus Martius, who died in 1476 (see
                      <title>Menagiana,</title> vol. i. p. 173, ed. 1715); and we learn from
                    Henricus Gandavensis, <title>De Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis</title> [that is,
                    Henry of Gaunt], that the <title>Alexandreis</title> had been a common
                    school-book. . . . The corrupt state in which this poem (of which I have not met
                    with the earliest edition) still appears, is perhaps imputable to frequent
                    transcription, and injudicious attempts at emendation. Every pedagogue through
                    whose hands the Ms. passed, seems to have made some ignorant and capricious
                    changes in its text; so that in many places it is as apparently interpolated and
                    corrupted as the ancient copies of Shakespeare</quote>
                  <bibl>(STEEVENS)</bibl>
                </cit>. I, like Steevens, have not seen the first edition of the
                  <title>Alexandreis;</title> but I possess a copy of the rare edition of 1513,
                which, I find, gives the above passage exactly as he cites it. After all, the
                substance of the line, <quote><mentioned>Incidis in Scyllam, cupiens vitare
                    Charybdim,</mentioned></quote> has been traced to St. Augustine, who writes as
                follows: <cit>
                  <quote>Distingue intelligentiâ, noli separare perfidiâ; ne iterum, quasi
                      <mentioned>fugiens Charybdim, in Scyllam incurras . . . a Charybdi quidem

                    portions of common assigned for a term to a particular proprietor, the other
                    commoners waiving for the time their right of common over them;’ but, although

                  <quote>The beetle is furnished with two large membranaceous wings, which are
                    protected from external injury by two very hard, horny wing-cases, or, as
                    entomologists term them, elytra. The old English name was ‘shard.’ . . . These
                    shards or wing-cases are raised and expanded when the beetle flies, and by their
                    concavity act like two parachutes in supporting him in the air. Hence the
                    propriety and correctness of Shakspeare's description, ‘the shard-borne beetle,’

                  <quote>The meaning of the words is plain; but the application of them may be
                    doubted, when Falstaff says that, when the armies join, <lb/>‘If it be a hot
                    day, and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I <lb/>would I might never
                      <mentioned>spit white</mentioned> again.’ <lb/>2 Henry IV., i. 2. 199. His
                    meaning is, may I never again have wine enough to produce that effect; or
                    rather, perhaps, may I never have a debauch overnight, to make me thirsty in the
                    morning. I fear we must condemn the intemperance of our ancestors, when we find
                    that this effect was often observed and alluded to. Spungius says, in Massinger,
                    <lb/>‘Had I been a pagan still, I should not have <mentioned>spit
                      white</mentioned> for want <lb/>of drink.’ That is, for want of more drink, to
                    remedy the effect of what he had taken before. It was noticed also as a
                    consequence of habitual intemperance. The unlucky pages in Lyly's
                      <mentioned>Mother Bombie</mentioned> say that their masters had sodden their
                    livers in sack for forty years, and <lb/>‘That makes them <mentioned>spit
                      white</mentioned> broath, as they do.’ Act iii. sc. 1.;</quote>

                  exhibited the figure of any saint, in honour of whom the child received its

                <bibl>THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN, v. 2. 74.</bibl>
                <quote>Stool-ball is frequently mentioned by the writers of the three last
                  centuries, but without any proper definition of the game. Doctor Johnson [in his
                    <title>Dict.</title>] tells us, it is a play where balls are driven from stool
                  to stool, but does not say in what manner or to what purpose. I have been
                  informed, that a pastime called stool-ball is practised to this day in the
                  northern parts of England, which consists in simply setting a stool upon the
                  ground, and one of the players takes his place before it, while his antagonist,
                  standing at a distance, tosses a ball with the intention of striking the stool;
                  and this it is the business of the former to prevent by beating it away with the
                  hand, reckoning one to the game for every stroke of the ball; if, on the contrary,
                  it should be missed by the hand and touch the stool, the players change places
                    [<mentioned>Note.</mentioned> I believe the same also happens if the person who
                  threw the ball can catch and retain it when driven back, before it reaches the
                  ground]; the conqueror at this game is he who strikes the ball most times before
                  it touches the stool. Again, in other parts of the country a certain number of
                  stools are set up in a circular form, and at a distance from each other, and every
                  one of them is occupied by a single player; when the ball is struck, which is done
                  as before with the hand, they are every one of them obliged to alter his
                  situation, running in succession from stool to stool, and if he who threw the ball
                  can regain it in time to strike any one of the players, before he reaches the
                  stool to which he is running, he takes his place, and the person touched must
                  throw the ball, until he can in like manner return to the circle. Stool-ball seems
                  to have been a game more properly appropriated to the women than to the men; but
                  occasionally it was played by the young persons of both sexes
                  indiscriminately,</quote>

                  <quote>The singular mixture of religious and military fanaticism which arose from
                    the crusades gave rise to the extraordinary custom of taking a solemn oath upon
                    a sword. In a plain unenriched sword, the separation between the blade and the
                    hilt was usually a straight transverse bar, which, suggesting the idea of a
                    cross, added to the devotion which every true knight felt for his favourite
                    weapon, and evidently led to this practice; of which the instances are too
                    numerous to be collected. The sword, or the blade, were often mentioned in this
                    ceremony, without reference to the cross.</quote>

                sword prevailed even among the barbarous worshippers of Odin:<cit>
                  <quote>The Scythians commonly substituted a sword as the most proper symbol to
                    represent the supreme god. It was by planting a spear in the middle of a field,
                    that they usually marked out the place set apart for prayers and sacrifices; and
                    when they had relaxed from their primitive strictness, so far as to build
                    temples and set up idols in them, they yet preserved some traces of the ancient
                    custom, by putting a sword in the hands of Odin's statues. The respect they had
                    for their arms made them also swear by instruments so valuable and so useful, as
                    being the most sacred things they knew. Accordingly, in an ancient Icelandic
                    poem, a Scandinavian, to assure himself of a person's good faith, requires him
                    to swear ‘by the shoulder of a horse, and the edge of a
                      <mentioned>sword.</mentioned>’ This oath was usual more especially on the eve
                    of some great engagement. The soldiers engaged themselves by an oath of this
                    kind, not to flee though their enemies should be never so superior in
                    number.</quote>

                  <quote>I believe none of the commentators have understood this; it is an allusion,
                    as the speaker says, to an <mentioned>old tale,</mentioned> which may perhaps be
                    still extant in some collections of such things, or which Shakespeare may have
                    heard, as I have, related by a great-aunt, in his childhood. <lb/>“Once upon a
                    time, there was a young lady (called Lady Mary in the story), who had two
                    brothers. One summer they all three went to a country-seat of theirs, which they
                    had not before visited. Among the other gentry in the neighbourhood who came to
                    see them was a Mr. Fox, a bachelor, with whom they, particularly the young lady,
                    were much pleased. He used often to dine with them, and frequently invited Lady
                    Mary to come and see his house. One day that her brothers were absent elsewhere,
                    and she had nothing better to do, she determined to go thither; and accordingly
                    set out unattended. When she arrived at the house, and knocked at the door, no
                    one answered. At length she opened it, and went in; over the portal of the hall
                    was written ‘<mentioned>Be bold, be bold, but not too bold:</mentioned>’ she
                    advanced; over the staircase, the same inscription: she went up; over the
                    entrance of a gallery, the same: she proceeded; over the door of a chamber
                      ‘<mentioned>Be bold, be bold, but not too bold, lest that your heart's blood
                      should run cold.</mentioned>’ She opened it: it was full of skeletons, tubs
                    full of blood, etc. She retreated in haste: coming down stairs, she saw out of a
                    window Mr. Fox advancing towards the house, with a drawn sword in one hand,
                    while with the other he dragged along a young lady by her hair. Lady Mary had
                    just time to slip down, and hide herself under the stairs, before Mr. Fox and
                    his victim arrived at the foot of them. As he pulled the young lady up stairs,
                    she caught hold of one of the banisters with her hand, on which was a rich
                    bracelet. Mr. Fox cut it off with his sword: the hand and bracelet fell into
                    Lady Mary's lap, who then contrived to escape unobserved, and got home safe to
                    her brother's house. After a few days, Mr. Fox came to dine with them as usual
                    (whether by invitation, or of his own accord, this deponent saith not). After
                    dinner, when the guests began to amuse each other with extraordinary anecdotes,
                    Lady Mary at length said, she would relate to them a remarkable dream she had
                    lately had. I dreamt, said she, that as you, Mr. Fox, had often invited me to
                    your house, I would go there one morning. When I came to the house, I knocked,
                    etc., but no one answered. When I opened the door, over the hall was written
                      ‘<mentioned>Be bold, be bold, but not too bold.</mentioned>’ But, said she,
                    turning to Mr. Fox, and smiling, ‘<mentioned>It is not so, nor it was not
                      so;</mentioned>’ then she pursues the rest of the story, concluding at every
                    turn with ‘<mentioned>It is not so, nor it was not so,</mentioned>’ till she
                    comes to the room full of dead bodies, when Mr. Fox took up the burden of the
                    tale, and said ‘<mentioned>It is not so, nor it was not so, and God forbid it
                      should be so:</mentioned>’ which he continues to repeat at every subsequent
                    turn of the dreadful story, till she came to the circumstance of his cutting off
                    the young lady's hand, when, upon his saying as usual, ‘<mentioned>It is not so,
                      nor it was not so, and God forbid it should be so,</mentioned>’ Lady Mary
                    retorts, ‘<mentioned>But it is so, and it was so, and here the hand I have to
                      show,</mentioned>’ at the same time producing the hand and bracelet from her
                    lap: whereupon the guests drew their swords, and instantly cut Mr. Fox into a
                    thousand pieces. <lb/>“Such is the <mentioned>old tale</mentioned> to which
                    Shakespeare evidently alludes, and which has often ‘<mentioned>froze my young
                      blood,</mentioned>’ when I was a child, as, I dare say, it had done his before
                    me. I will not apologize for repeating it, since it is manifest that such
                      <mentioned>old wives' tales</mentioned> often prove the best elucidation of
                    this writer's meaning</quote>

                    old tale</mentioned></quote> alluded to by Shakespeare; but Blakeway was not
                aware that one of the circumstances in the good lady's narrative is borrowed from
                Spenser's description of what Britomart saw in the castle of Busyrane: <lb/><cit>
                  <quote>Tho, as she backward cast her busie eye<lb/> To search each secrete of that
                    goodly sted, <lb/>Over the dore thus written she did spy <lb/><mentioned>Bee

                    <lb/>And as she lookt about, she did behold <lb/>How over that same dore was

                <lb/>Another illustration of the present passage of Shakespeare is supplied to me by
                my friend, the Rev. Canon Harness. <quote>My nurse,</quote> he says,<quote>used,
                  with considerable dramatic effect, to tell me in my childhood the following story.
                  A very wicked king had killed his beautiful daughter. The act, from beginning to
                  end, was overseen by one of his courtiers. This person took occasion to relate, as
                  fiction, all the circumstances of the transaction to his master, continually
                  interrupting the tale, as he perceived the conscience of the murderer excited, by
                  the words, ‘<mentioned>But it is not so, and it was not so, and God forbid it
                    should be so.</mentioned>’ At last, having brought his tale to its conclusion,
                  he exclaimed, at the same time stabbing the wicked king to the heart,
                    ‘<mentioned>But it is so, and it was so; and you are the man that made it
                    so.</mentioned>’—It is very nearly seventy years since I heard this story, and I
                  may have confused it in some respects with others, of which old nurse had a
                  glorious collection. My impression is—but of that I am not certain— that the
                  wicked king killed his daughter by shutting her up and leaving her to starve
                  inside a Golden Bull which he had made, and that <title>The Golden Bull</title>
                  was the name of the story.</quote>

                when a large portion of an undated edition of it (forming the pasteboard covers of
                an old volume) was discovered by the Rev. J. J. Conybeare, and reprinted the same
                year in Singer's <title>Shakespeare's JestBook;</title> and, a comparatively short
                time ago, a complete copy of an edition dated 1526 was found in the Royal Library of
                the University of Göttingen by Dr. Herman Oesterley, who put forth a careful reprint
                of it in the year 1866. Both the old editions are from the press of Rastell, but
                differ very considerably in the text. Dr. Oesterley has been at great pains in
                tracing the sources of these tales: many of them, however, are unquestionably
                original. The collection, with all its nonsense, is amusing enough; that it should
                have a sprinkling of indecency was only to be expected. </entryFree>

                    figure to denote his government of that part. Sagittarius, Capricornus,
                    Aquarius, and Pisces, intimate, by various pictorial devices, their influence
                    over the lower limbs. 2. In the calendar which precedes the aforesaid figure, we
                    are assured that Taurus ‘gouerneth the <mentioned>necke, throat,</mentioned> and
                      <mentioned>voyce;</mentioned>’ and, moreover, that it is a ‘fortunate signe in

                    characters of the two renowned knights. Sir Toby, who is a merciless wit,
                    artfully draws in Sir Andrew to betray his ignorance, and then misleads him by a

                required from each of Portia's suitors before the trial of the caskets. This is to
                be gathered from the rest of the passage [lines 38-45]: <lb/><quote><hi rend="ital">Por.</hi> You must take your chance; <lb/>And either not attempt to choose at

                  made.</quote> And it becomes perfectly certain from the dialogue between Portia
                and the Prince of Arragon in ii. 9. 4-19: <lb/><quote><hi rend="ital">Por.</hi>
                  Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince: etc. <lb/><hi rend="ital">Ar.</hi>
                  I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things: <lb/>First, never to unfold to any
                  one <lb/>Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail <lb/>Of the right casket,
                  never in my life <lb/>To woo a maid in way of marriage:<lb/> Lastly, <lb/>If I do
                  fail in fortune of my choice, <lb/>Immediately to leave you and be gone. <lb/><hi rend="ital">Por.</hi> To these injunctions every one doth swear <lb/>That comes
                  to hazard for my worthless self. <lb/><hi rend="ital">Ar.</hi> And so have I

                  <quote><mentioned>thrid</mentioned></quote> occurs in Dryden, and, I believe, in
                still more recent writers. In a volume which I published in 1853, I observed:
                  <quote>In case any future editor should still be inclined to make Prospero term
                  Miranda ‘a <mentioned>third</mentioned> of his life’ (the folio having here
                  ‘third’=thrid, thread), it may be well to remark, that in the language of poetry,
                  from the earliest times, a beloved object has always been spoken of, not as the
                    <mentioned>third,</mentioned> but as the <mentioned>half</mentioned> of

                [1866. So, too, in prose: <quote>But when I came againe to my selfe, and saw my

                think holds good against the reading of the folio, had no weight with the late

                defended that read ing, attaching to it a ridiculously forced meaning: nor has my

                  <quote>A diversion is common with boys in Warwickshire and the adjoining counties,
                    on finding a toad, to lay a board about two or three feet long, at right angles,
                    over a stick about two or three inches diameter. Then placing the toad at one
                    end of the board, the other end is struck by a bat or large stick, which throws
                    the creature forty or fifty feet perpendicular from the earth, and its return in
                    general kills it. This is called <mentioned>Filliping the Toad.</mentioned>—A
                      <mentioned>three-man beetle</mentioned> is an implement used for driving
                    piles; it is made of a log of wood, about eighteen or twenty inches diameter,
                    and fourteen or fifteen inches thick, with one short and two long handles. A man
                    at each of the long handles manages the fall of the beetle, and a third man, by
                    the short handle, assists in raising it to strike the blow. Such an implement
                    was, without doubt, very suitable for <mentioned>filliping</mentioned> so

                    understood both by Malone and Steevens as carrying an allusion to the practice
                    of persons dipping their handkerchiefs in the blood of those whom they regarded
                    as martyrs. And it must be confessed that the general strain of the passage, and
                    more especially the expression ‘shall <hi rend="ital">press</hi> for tinctures,’
                    etc., will not easily allow us to reject this interpretation. Yet does it not
                    make the speaker assign to Cæsar by implication the very kind of death
                    Calpurnia's apprehension of which he professes to regard as visionary? The
                    pressing for tinctures and stains, it is true, would be a confutation of so much
                    of Calpurnia's dream as seemed to imply that the Roman people would be delighted
                    with his death: <lb/>‘Many lusty Romans<lb/> Came smiling, and did bathe their
                    hands in it.’ Do we refine too much in supposing that this inconsistency between
                    the purpose and the language of Decius is intended by the poet, and that in this
                    brief dialogue between him and Cæsar, in which the latter suffers himself to be
                    so easily won over,—persuaded and relieved by the very words that ought
                    naturally to have confirmed his fears,— we are to feel the presence of an unseen
                    power driving on both the unconscious prophet and the blinded victim?</quote>

                  has been supposed to allude to lopping of trees; but if we examine the context, no
                  such violent measure seems there suggested. Prospero says that his brother, having
                  the care of government deputed to him, became <lb/>‘Perfected how to grant suits,
                  <lb/>How to deny them, who to advance, and who<lb/> To

                  2. 79-81. It stands, therefore, opposed only to <mentioned>advance,</mentioned>
                  and seems to mean no more than that those who were too forward, he <mentioned>kept
                    back,</mentioned>—did not advance. To cut them off would have been a measure to
                  create alarm. . . . I conceive, therefore, that it is a hunting term, for checking
                  or stopping the dogs, when too forward [see the preceding article],</quote>

                    term in arboriculture. To quote examples of that is needless. Of it
                    metaphorically applied, just as in Shakspeare, take the following example: ‘Of
                    those three estates, which swayeth most, that in a manner doth
                      <mentioned>overtop</mentioned> the rest, and like a foregrown member depriveth

                      <mentioned>trash</mentioned> in the sense of shreddings, at p. 542, book iii.
                    of a <title>Discourse of Forest Trees,</title> by John Evelyn? The extract that
                    contains the word is this: ‘Faggots to be every stick of three feet in length,
                    excepting only one stick of one foot long, to harden and wedge the binding of
                    it; this to prevent the abuse, too much practised, of filling the middle part
                    and ends with <mentioned>trash</mentioned> and short sticks, which had been
                    omitted in the former statute.’ . . . <mentioned>Trash</mentioned> no one denies
                    to be a kennel term for hampering a dog, but it does not presently follow that
                    the word bore no other signification; indeed there is no more fruitful mother of
                    confusion than homonomy</quote>

                  <quote>In my [preceding] note on the word <mentioned>trash,</mentioned> I said
                    (somewhat too peremptorily), that <mentioned>overtop</mentioned> was not even a
                    hunting term. At the moment I had forgotten the following passage: ‘Therefore I
                    would perswade all lovers of hunting to get two or three couple of tryed hounds,
                    and once or twice a week to follow after them a train-scent; and when he is able
                    to <mentioned>top</mentioned> them on all sorts of earth, and to endure heats
                    and colds stoutly, then he may the better relie on his speed and toughness.’

                  <quote>It may be doubted whether this passage has been rightly explained, and
                    whether the commentators have not given Shakspeare credit for more skill in
                    heraldry than he really possessed, or at least than he intended to exhibit on
                    the present occasion. Helen says, ‘we had two seeming bodies, but only one
                    heart.’ She then exemplifies her position by a simile—‘we had <mentioned>two of
                      the first,</mentioned>’ that is, <mentioned>bodies,</mentioned> like the
                    double coats in heraldry that belong to man and wife as <mentioned>one
                      person,</mentioned> but which, like our <mentioned>single heart,</mentioned>
                    have but <mentioned>one crest</mentioned></quote>

                  <quote>The plain heraldical allusion is to the simple impalements of two armorial
                    ensigns, as they are marshalled side by side to represent a marriage; and the
                    expression, ‘Two of the first,’ is to <mentioned>that particular form of
                      dividing the shield, being the first in order of the nine ordinary partitions
                      of the Escutcheon.</mentioned> These principles were familiarly understood in
                    the time of Shakespeare by all the readers of the many very popular heraldical
                    works of the period, and an extract from one of these will probably render the
                    meaning of the passage clear. In ‘<title>The Accedence of Armorie,</title>’
                    published by Gerard Leigh, in 1597, he says, ‘Now will I declare to you of IX
                    sundrie Partitions:—the <mentioned>First whereof is a partition from the highest
                      part of the Escocheon to the lowest. And though it must be blazed so, yet is
                      it a joining together.</mentioned> It is also a mariage, that is to say,
                      <mentioned>two cotes;</mentioned> the man's on the right side, and the woman's
                    on the left; as it might be said that Argent had maried with Gules.’ In
                    different words, this is nothing else than an amplification of Helena's own
                    expression, ‘seeming parted:<lb/> But yet a union in partition.’ <lb/> The
                    shield bearing the arms of two married persons would of course be surmounted by
                    one crest only, as the text properly remarks, that of the husband. In
                    Shakespeare's day, the only pleas for bearing two crests were ancient usage, or
                    a special grant. The modern practice of introducing a second crest by an heiress
                    has been most improperly adopted from the German heraldical system; for it
                    should be remembered, that as a female cannot wear a helmet, so neither can she
                    bear a crest</quote>

                    upon interest— a sense which the phrase certainly sometimes bore; but that
                    interpretation is altogether inconsistent, in the present passage, with the
                    generosity of Antonio's character. In conveyances of land, where it is intended
                    to give the estate to any person after the death of another, it is necessary
                    that a third person should be possessed of the estate, and the

                    other; or the estate to the future possessor would be rendered insecure. This is
                    called a conveyance to <mentioned>uses,</mentioned> and the party is said to be
                    possessed, or rather <mentioned>seised</mentioned> to the

                  <quote>The Spanish Armada, I believe, furnished our author with this name. Don
                    Pedro de <mentioned>Valdes</mentioned> was an admiral in that fleet, and had the
                    command of the great galleon of Andalusia. His ship being disabled, he was taken
                    by Sir Francis Drake, on the twenty-second of July, 1588, and sent to Dartmouth.
                    This play therefore, we may conclude, was not written till after that period.
                    The making one of this Spaniard's ancestors a pirate was probably relished by

                  <bibl> HAMLET, iii. 4. 98.</bibl>
                </cit> These passages allude to an important character in the old Moral-plays, the
                Vice, so named doubtless from the <mentioned>vicious</mentioned> qualities
                attributed to him. <quote>As the Devil,</quote> says Mr. Collier,<cit>
                  <quote>now and then appeared without the Vice, so the Vice sometimes appeared
                    without the Devil. Malone tells us that ‘the principal employment of the Vice
                    was to belabour the Devil;’ but although he was frequently so engaged, he had
                    also higher duties. He figured now and then in the religious plays of a later
                    date, and, as has been shewn, in <title>The Life and Repentance of Mary
                      Magdalen,</title> 1567, he performed the part of her lover, before her con
                    version, under the name of Infidelity. In <title>King Darius,</title> 1565, he
                    also acted a prominent part, by his own impulses to mischief, under the name of
                    Iniquity, without any prompting from the representative of the principle of
                    evil. Such was the general style of the Vice, and as Iniquity he is spoken of by
                    Shakespeare (<title>Richard III.,</title> iii. 1. 82) and Ben Jonson
                      (<title>Staple of News,</title> second Intermean). The Vice and Iniquity seem,
                    however, sometimes to have been distinct persons; and he was not unfrequently
                    called by the name of particular vices: thus, in <title>Lvsty Juventus,</title>
                    the Vice performs the part of Hypocrisy; in <title>Common Conditions,</title> he
                    is called Conditions; in <title>Like will to Like,</title> he is named Nichol
                    New-fangle; in <title>The Trial of Treasure,</title> his part is that of
                    Inclination; in <title>All for Money,</title> he is called Sin; in <title>Tom
                      Tyler and his Wife,</title> Desire; and in <title>Appius and Virginia,</title>
                    Haphazard. . . . Though Mr. Douce is unquestionably correct when he states that
                    the Vice was ‘generally dressed in a fool's habit’ [hence the expression in
                      <title>Hamlet,</title> iii. 4. 98, ‘A king of shreds and patches’], he did not
                    by any means constantly wear the parti-coloured habiliments of a fool; he was
                    sometimes required to act a gallant, and now and then to assume the disguise of
                    virtues it suited his purpose to personate. . . . The Vice, like the fool, was
                    sometimes furnished with a dagger of lath, and it was not unusual that it should
                    be gilt. . . . Tattle [in Jonson's <title>Staple of News</title>] observes, ‘but
                    there [here] is never a fiend to carry him [the Vice] away;’ and in the first
                    Intermean of the same play, Mirth leads us to suppose that it was a very common
                    termination of the adventures of the Vice for him to be carried off to hell on
                    the back of the devil: ‘he would carry away the Vice on his back, quick to hell,
                    in every play where he came.’ In <title>The Longer thou livest the more Fool
                      thou art,</title> and in <title>Like will to Like,</title> the Vice is
                    disposed of nearly in this summary manner: in the first, Confusion carries him
                    to the devil, and in the last, Lucifer bears him off to the infernal regions on
                    his shoulders. In <title>King Darius,</title> the Vice runs to hell of his own
                    accord, to escape from Constancy, Equity, and Charity. According to Bishop
                    Harsnet (in a passage cited by Malone,—<title>Shakespeare</title> by Boswell,
                    iii. 27), the Vice was in the habit of riding and beating the devil, at other
                    times than when he was thus carried against his will to punishment.</quote>

                  <quote>This phrase [<mentioned>warrior</mentioned>] was introduced by our copiers

                    prodigal of the same appellation. Thus, in his Fifth Sonnet: <lb/> ‘And, my
                      <mentioned>warrier,</mentioned> my light shines in thy fayre eyes.’ <lb/>
                    Again, in his Sixth Sonnet: <lb/> ‘I am not, my cruell
                      <mentioned>warrier,</mentioned> the Thebain,’ etc. <lb/> Again,

                    <lb/> ‘I came not, my <mentioned>warrier,</mentioned> of the blood Lidian.’
                    <lb/> Had not I met with the word thus fantastically applied, I should have

                    This long list of titles is taken from the epitaph formerly fixed on Lord
                    Talbot's tomb in Rouen in Normandy. Where this author found it, I have not been
                    able to ascertain, for it is not in the common historians. The oldest book in
                    which I have met with it is the tract above mentioned, which was printed in
                    1599, posterior to the date of this play. Numerous as this list is, the epitaph
                    has one more, which, I suppose, was only rejected, because it would not easily
                    fall into the verse, ‘Lord Lovetoft of Worsop.’ It concludes as here: ‘Lord
                    Falconbridge, Knight of the [most] noble order of St. George, St. Michael, and
                    the Golden Fleece, Great Marshall to King Henry VI. of his realm in [of] France,

                    was imposed upon, and the enumeration is erroneous in the particulars which I

                  <quote>The pedantic poet in <title>Timon of Athens,</title> i. 1. 45-53, addresses
                    the painter in the following tumid and bombastic terms: <lb/> ‘You see this
                    confluence, this great flood of visitors. <lb/>I have, in this rough work
                    [shewing his Ms.], shaped out a man, <lb/>Whom this beneath world doth embrace
                    and hug <lb/>With amplest entertainment: my free drift <lb/>Halts not
                    particularly, but moves itself <lb/>In <mentioned>a wide sea of wax:</mentioned>
                    no levell'd malice <lb/>Infects one comma of [in] the course I hold; <lb/>But
                    flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on, <lb/>Leaving no track behind.’ <lb/>In
                    this passage, <mentioned>my free drift,</mentioned> and <mentioned>a wide sea of
                      wax,</mentioned> are contrasted with the notion of halting
                      <mentioned>particularly,</mentioned> and <mentioned>levell'd
                      malice.</mentioned> In other words, the poet is contrasting generality with
                    particularity. The visitors, who throng the ante-room and presence-chamber of
                    Lord Timon, are compared by the poet to a sea at flood-time, and are therefore
                    designated <mentioned>a confluence</mentioned> and <mentioned>a great
                      flood.</mentioned> Timon is said to be embraced with
                      <mentioned>amplest</mentioned> entertainment by this flood; and the poet,
                    disclaiming personal censure, declares that his ‘<mentioned>free
                      drift</mentioned> moves itself in <mentioned>a wide sea of wax.</mentioned>’
                    What is the meaning of <mentioned>wax?</mentioned> Every one knows that the verb
                      <mentioned>to wax</mentioned> means to grow; and the old English writers
                    employ it indifferently of increase and decrease; a thing, with them, may
                      <mentioned>wax</mentioned> smaller or greater, weaker or stronger. To
                      <mentioned>wax</mentioned> was to change condition simply. But more strictly
                    it was and is used in opposition to <mentioned>wane.</mentioned> If anything
                    changes its condition, it either <mentioned>waxes</mentioned> or
                      <mentioned>wanes.</mentioned> In this restricted sense, Shakespeare in several
                    places uses the verb <mentioned>to wax,</mentioned> of the sea: <lb/> ‘Who marks
                    the <mentioned>waxing</mentioned> tide grow wave by wave.’ <lb/><title>Titus
                      Andronicus,</title> iii. 1. 95.<lb/> ‘His pupil age <lb/>Man-enter'd thus, he
                      <mentioned>waxed like a sea.</mentioned>’ <lb/><title>Coriolanus,</title> ii.
                    2. 97. <lb/> The old editors and commentators seem not to have had the faintest
                    suspicion of the meaning of the expression, ‘a wide sea of wax.’ Hanmer and
                    Steevens explain it as an allusion to the Roman and early English practice of
                    writing with a style on tablets coated with wax, so that the poet in
                      <title>Timon</title> must be supposed to have literally ‘shaped out’ his man
                    in wax, as much so as if he had modelled him. All the editors have followed in
                    this rut; even Messrs. Dyce and Staunton, of whom better things might have been
                    expected. The only emendation that has been made on <mentioned>wax</mentioned>
                    is Mr. Collier's <mentioned>verse,</mentioned> which Mr. Staunton rejects,
                    though he still thinks <mentioned>wax</mentioned> a misprint for something. Very
                    strange indeed is all this speculation, in the face of the certain fact that
                      <mentioned>wax</mentioned> or <mentioned>wax</mentioned> occurs as a
                    substantive, in the very sense of expandedness (or growth), in two other places
                    in Shakespeare, and once in Ben Jonson. Here are the passages: <lb/>‘<hi rend="ital">Chief Justice.</hi> What! you are as a candle, the better part
                    burnt <lb/>out. <lb/><hi rend="ital">Falstaff.</hi> A wassail candle, my lord,
                    all tallow: if I did say of <lb/><mentioned>wax,</mentioned> my
                      <mentioned>growth</mentioned> would approve the truth.’ <lb/>
                    <title>2 Henry IV.</title>, i. 2. 147-150. <lb/><lb/>‘Why, he's a man of
                      <mentioned>wax.</mentioned>’ <bibl><title>Romeo and Juliet,</title> i. 3. 77.
                      ‘A man of wax’ is a man of full growth. Of Falstaff it would mean, a man of
                      ample dimensions; of Romeo it means, a man of puberty, ‘a proper man.’ Again
                      in <title>The Fall of Mortimer,</title> a fragmentary drama by Ben Jonson, we
                      read, <lb/> ‘At what a divers price do divers men <lb/>Act the same thing[s]!
                      another might have had, <lb/>Perhaps the hurdle, or at least the axe, <lb/>For
                      what I have, this crownet, robes, and <mentioned>waxe.</mentioned>’ Here
                        <mentioned>waxe</mentioned> is ‘personal aggrandisement—the substantive
                      accomplishment of the verb to wax great.’ (Collier, Coleridge, and
                      Shakespeare, p. 129.) Let us hope that we have heard the last of ‘the waxen
                      tables of the ancients’!</bibl></quote>
                  <bibl>pp. 226-8</bibl>
                </cit>. </p>
              <p>1. The passage of <title>Timon of Athens</title> is unquestionably a very difficult
                one, and perhaps not altogether free from corruption; but what must be that critic's
                idea of the proprieties of language who imagines that <mentioned>a sea of
                  wax</mentioned> can mean <quote>a sea of increase—a sea at flood-time</quote>? </p>
              <p>2. Who, except Dr. Ingleby, would ever have dreamed of quoting Falstaff's
                  <mentioned>quibble,</mentioned>
                <quote>A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say of
                    <mentioned>wax,</mentioned> my <mentioned>growth</mentioned> would approve the
                  truth,</quote> as an evidence of the existence of a substantive
                    <quote><mentioned>wax</mentioned>
                </quote> in the sense of <quote><mentioned>expandedness or
                  growth</mentioned></quote>? </p>
              <p>3. Even if his own reading had not supplied him with some of the passages in
                various old authors that clearly show the true meaning of <quote><mentioned>a man of
                    wax,</mentioned></quote> it seems inconceivable that Dr. Ingleby should have so
                grossly misunderstood those words in <title>Romeo and Juliet</title> as to explain
                them <quote>a man of puberty, a proper man,</quote> since he could hardly have
                overlooked the following notes in the <title>Variorum Shakespeare,</title> which are
                sufficiently to the purpose: <cit>
                  <quote><mentioned>a man of wax</mentioned>] So in <title>Wily Beguiled,</title>
                    <lb/>‘Why, he's a man as one should picture him in

                  <bibl>STEEVENS</bibl>
                </cit>;; <quote><mentioned>a man of wax</mentioned>] Well made, as if he had been
                  modelled in wax, as Mr. Steevens by a happy quotation has explained it. ‘When you,
                  Lydia, praise the waxen arms of Telephus,’ says Horace
                    [<mentioned>Waxen,</mentioned> well-shaped, fine-turned], etc. S[tephen]
                  W[eston].</quote>
              </p>
              <p>I add another passage which is decisive as to the true meaning of
                    <quote><mentioned>a man of wax:</mentioned></quote>

              </p>
              <p>4. Dr. Ingleby allows himself to be persuaded by a silly pamphleteer that in the
                line of the opening speech of Jonson's fragment, <title>The Fall of
                  Mortimer,</title>
                <lb/><quote>For what I have, this crownet, robes, and
                  <mentioned>waxe,</mentioned></quote> the word

                    aggrandisement.</mentioned></quote> Now, a little further on in the same speech
                we find <quote>To-day is Mortimer made <mentioned>Earl of March;</mentioned></quote>
                and Jonson tells us in his <title>Argument</title> that <quote>The First Act
                  comprehends Mortimer's pride and security, raised <mentioned>to the degree of an

                together with the words <quote><mentioned>crownet</mentioned> and
                    <mentioned>robes,</mentioned></quote> is quite enough to determine that
                    <quote><mentioned>waxe</mentioned></quote> means some sort of waxen seal

                <mentioned>Worshipp'd,</mentioned> that is, honoured. <cit>
                  <quote>Steevens says that the allusion is ‘to the ancient custom of writing on
                    waxen tablets;’ and Malone proves, at the expense of two pages, that his friend
                    has mistaken the poet's meaning, and that he himself is—just as wide of it. In
                    many parts of the continent it is customary, upon the decease of an eminent
                    person, for his friends to compose short laudatory poems, epitaphs, etc., and
                    affix them to the herse, or grave, with pins, wax, paste, etc. Of this practice,
                    which was once prevalent here also, I had collected many notices. . . . To this
                    practice Shakespeare alludes. He had, at first, written
                      ‘<mentioned>paper</mentioned>’ epitaph, which he judiciously changed to
                      ‘<mentioned>waxen,</mentioned>’ as less ambiguous, and altogether as familiar
                    to his audience. Henry's meaning therefore is, ‘I will either have my full
                    history recorded with glory, or lie in an undistinguished grave; not merely
                    without an inscription sculptured in stone, but unworshipped (unhonoured) even
                    by a waxen epitaph,’ that is, by the short-lived compliment of a paper fastened
                    on it.</quote>

                  <quote>In the neighbourhood of the fetlock there are occasionally found
                    considerable enlargements, oftener on the hind-leg than the fore-one, which are
                    denominated <mentioned>wind-galls.</mentioned> Between the tendons and other
                    parts, and wherever the tendons are exposed to pressure or friction, and
                    particularly about their extremities, little bags or sacs are placed, containing
                    and suffering to ooze slowly from them a mucous fluid to lubricate the parts.
                    From undue pressure, and that most frequently caused by violent action and
                    straining of the tendons, or, often, from some predisposition about the horse,
                    these little sacs are injured. They take on inflammation, and sometimes become
                    large and indurated. There are few horses perfectly free from them. When they
                    first appear, and until the inflammation subsides, they may be accompanied by
                    some degree of lameness; but otherwise, except when they attain a great size,
                    they do not interfere with the action of the animal, or cause any considerable
                    unsoundness. The farriers used to suppose that they contained wind— hence their
                    name, wind-galls; and hence the practice of opening them, by which dreadful
                    inflammation was often produced, and many a valuable horse destroyed. It is not
                    uncommon for wind-galls entirely to disappear in aged horses.</quote>

                  <quote>Zed is here properly used as a term of contempt, because it is the last
                    letter in the English alphabet, and as its place may be supplied by S; and the
                    Roman alphabet has it not; neither is it read in any word originally Teutonick.
                    In Barret's <title>Alvearie, or Quadruple Dictionary,</title> 1580, it is quite
                    omitted, as the author affirms it to be rather a syllable than a letter</quote>

                    harder amongst us, and seldom seen: S is become its lieutenant-general. It is
