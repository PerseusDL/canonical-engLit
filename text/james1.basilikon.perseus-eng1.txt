OF A KINGS CHRISTIAN DVETIE TOWARDS GOD. The First Booke. 

 As he cannot be thought worthy to rule and command others, that cannot rule and dantone his
 owne proper affections and vnreasonable appetites, so can hee not be thought worthie to
 gouerne a Christian people, knowing and fearing God, that in his owne person and heart,
 feareth not and loueth not the Diuine Maiestie. Neither can anything in his gouernment succeed
 well with him, (deuise and labour as he list) as comming from a filthie spring, if his person
 be vnsanctified: for (as that royal Prophet saith) Except the Lord build the
 house, they labour in vaine that build it: except the Lord keepe the City, the keepers watch
 it in vaine : in respect the
 blessing of God hath onely power to giue the successe thereunto: and as Paul saith, he planteth, Apollos watereth; but it is God onely that
 giueth the in- crease . Therefore
 (my Sonne) first of all things, learne to know and loue that God, whom-to ye haue a double
 obligation; first, for that he made you a man; and next, for that he made you a little GOD to
 sit on his Throne, and rule ouer other men. Remember, that as in dignitie hee hath erected you
 aboue others, so ought ye in thankfulnesse towards him, goe as farre beyond all others. A
 moate in an- others eye, is a beame into yours: a blemish in another, is a leprouse byle into
 you: and a veniall sinne (as the Papifts call it) in another, is a great crime into you.
 Thinke not therefore, that the highnesse of your dignitie, diminisheth your faults (much lesse
 giueth you a licence to sinne) but by the contrary your fault shall be aggrauated, according
 to the height of your dignitie; any sinne that ye commit, not being a single sinne procuring
 but the fall of one; but being an ex- emplare sinne, and therefore drawing with it the whole
 multitude to be guiltie of the same. Remember then, that this glistering worldly glorie of
 Kings, is giuen them by God, to teach them to preasse so to glister and shine before their
 people, in all workes of sanctification and righteousnesse, that their persons as bright
 lampes of godlinesse and vertue, may, going in and out before their people, giue light to all
 their steps. Remember also, that by the right knowledge, and feare of God (which is the beginning of Wisedome , as Salomon saith) ye shall know all the things necessarie
 for the discharge of your duetie, both as a Christian, and as a King; seeing in him, as in a
 mirrour, the course of all earthly things, whereof hee is the spring and onely moouer. 
 Now, the onely way to bring you to this knowledge, is diligently to reade his word, and
 earnestly to pray for the right vnderstanding thereof. Search the
 Scriptures , sayth Christ, for they beare testimonie of me : and, the whole
 Scripture, saith Paul, is giuen by inspiration of God, and is
 profitable to teach, to conuince, to correct, and to instruct in righteousnesse; that the man
 of God may be absolute, being made perfite vnto all good workes . And most properly of any other, belong- 
 eth the reading thereof vnto Kings, since in that part of Scripture, where the godly Kings are
 first made mention of, that were ordained to rule ouer the people of God, there is an expresse
 and most notable exhortation and commandement giuen them, to reade and meditate in the Law of
 God. I ioyne to this, the carefull hearing
 of the doctrine with attendance and reuerence: for, faith commeth by
 hearing , sayeth the same Apostle.
 But aboue all, beware ye wrest not the word to your owne appetite, as ouer many doe, making it
 like a bell to sound as ye please to interprete: but by the contrary, frame all your
 affections, to follow precisely the rule there set downe. 
 The whole Scripture chiefly containeth two things: a command, and a pro- hibition, to doe
 such things, and to abstaine from the contrary. Obey in both; neither thinke it enough to
 abstaine from euill, and do no good; nor thinke not that if yee doe many good things, it may
 serve you for a cloake to mixe euill turnes therewith. And as in these two points, the whole
 Scripture principally consisteth, so in two degrees standeth the whole seruice of God by man:
 interiour, or vpward; exteriour, or downward: the first, by prayer in faith towards God; the
 next, by workes flowing therefra before the world: which is nothing else, but the exercise of
 Religion towards God, and of equitie towards your neighbour. 
 As for the particular points of Religion, I need not to dilate them; I am no hypocrite,
 follow my footsteps, and your owne present education therein. I thanke God, I was neuer
 ashamed to giue account of my profession, howsoeuer the malicious lying tongues of some haue
 traduced me: and if my conscience had not resolued me, that all my Religion presently
 professed by me and my king- dome, was grounded vpon the plaine words of the Scripture,
 without the which all points of Religion are superfluous, as any thing contrary to the same is
 abomi- nation, I had neuer outwardly auowed it, for pleasure or awe of any flesh. 
 And as for the points of equitie towards your neighbour (because that will fall in properly,
 vpon the second part concerning a Kings office) I leaue it to the owne roume. 
 For the first part then of mans seruice to his God, which is Religion, that is, the worship
 of God according to his reuealed will, it is wholly grounded vpon the Scripture, as I haue
 alreadie said, quickened by faith, and conserued by con- science: For the Scripture, I haue
 now spoken of it in generall, but that yee may the more readily make choice of any part
 thereof, for your instruction or comfort, remember shortly this methode. 
 The whole Scripture is dyted by Gods Spirit, thereby, as by his liuely word, to instruct and
 rule the whole Church militant to the and of the world: It is composed of two parts, the Olde
 and New Testament: The ground of the former is the Lawe, which sheweth our sinne, and
 containeth iustice: the ground of the other is Christ, who pardoning sinne containeth grace.
 The summe of the Law is the tenne Commandements, more largely delated in the bookes of Moses, in- 
 terpreted and applied by the Prophets; and by the histories, are the examples
 shewed of obedience or disobedience thereto, and what praemium or p√¶na was accordingly giuen by God: But because no man was able to keepe
 the Law, nor any part thereof, it pleased God of his infinite wisedome and goodnesse, to
 incar- nate his only Sonne in our nature, for satisfaction of his iustice in his suffering for
 vs; that since we could not be saued by doing, we might at least, bee saued by beleeuing. 
 The ground therefore of the word of grace, is contained in the foure histories of the birth,
 life, death, resurrection and ascention of Christ: The larger interpre- tation and vse
 thereof, is contained in the Epistles of the Apostles: and the practise in the faithfull or
 vnfaithfull, with the historie of the infancie and first progresse of the Church is contained
 in their Actes. 
 Would ye then know your sinne by the Lawe ? reade the bookes of Moses 
 con- taining it. Would ye haue a commentarie thereupon ? Reade the Prophets, and likewise the
 bookes of the Prouerbes and Ecclesiastes ,
 written by that great pat- terne of wisedome Salomon , which will not
 only serue you for instruction, how to walke in the obedience of the Lawe of God, but is also
 so full of golden sentences, and morall precepts, in all things that can concerne your
 conuersation in the world, as among all the prophane Philosophers and Poets, ye shall not
 finde so rich a storehouse of precepts of naturall wisedome, agreeing with the will and diuine
 wisedome of God. Would ye see how good men are rewarded, and wicked punished ? looke the
 historicall parts of these same bookes of Moses , together with the
 histories of Ioshua , the Iudges, Ezra, Nehemiah,
 Esther , and Iob: but especially the bookes of the Kings and Chronicles , wherewith ye ought to bee familiarly acquainted: for there
 shall yee see your selfe, as in a myrrour, in the catalogue either of the good or the euill
 Kings. 
 Would yee know the doctrine, life, and death of our Sauiour Christ ? reade the Euangelists.
 Would ye bee more particularly trained vp in his Schoole ? meditate vpon the Epistles of the
 Apostles. And would ye be acquainted with the practises of that doctrine in the persons of the
 primitiue Church ? Cast vp the Apostles Actes. And as to the Apocryphe bookes, I omit them,
 because I am no Papist, as I said before; and indeed some of them are no wayes like the dyte-
 ment of the Spirit of God. 
 But when ye reade the Scripture, reade it with a sanctified and chaste heart: admire
 reuerently such obscure places as ye vnderstand not, blaming onely your owne capacitie: read
 with delight the plaine places, and studie carefully to vnder- stand those that are somewhat
 difficile: preasse to bee a good textuarie; for the Scripture is euer the best interpreter of
 it selfe; but preasse not curiously to seeke out farther then is contained therein; for that
 were ouer vnmannerly a presump- tion, to striue to bee further vpon Gods secrets, then he hath
 will ye be; for what hee thought needfull for vs to know, that hath he reuealed there: And
 delyte most in reading such parts of the Scripture, as may best serue for your instruction in your calling; reiecting foolish curiosities vpon genealogies and contentions, which are but vaine, and profite not, as Paul saith. 
 Now, as to Faith, which is the nourisher and quickner of Religion, as I haue alreadie said,
 It is a sure perswasion and apprehension of the promises of God, applying them to your soule:
 and therefore may it iustly be called, the golden chaine that linketh the faithfull soule to
 Christ: And because it groweth not in our garden, but is the free gift of
 God , as the same Apostle saith,
 it must be nourished by prayer, Which is nothing else, but a friendly talking with God. 
 As for teaching you the forme of your prayers, the Psalmes of Dauid 
 are the meetest schoole-master that ye can be acquainted with (next the prayer of our Sauiour,
 which is the onely rule of prayer) whereout of, as of most rich and pure fountaines, ye may
 learne all forme of prayer necessarie for your comfort at all occasions: And so much the
 fitter are they for you, then for the common sort, in respect the composer thereof was a King:
 and therefore best behoued to know a Kings wants, and what things were meetest to be required
 by a King at Gods hand for remedie thereof. 
 Vse often to pray when ye are quietest, especially forget it not in your bed how oft soeuer
 ye doe it at other times: for publike prayer serueth as much for example, as for any
 particular comfort to the supplicant. 
 In your prayer, bee neither ouer strange with God, like the ignorant common sort, that
 prayeth nothing but out of bookes, nor yet ouer homely with him, like some of the vaine
 Pharisaicall puritanes, that thinke they rule him vpon their fingers: The former way will
 breede an vncouth coldnesse in you.towards him, the other will breede in you a contempt of
 him. But in your prayer to God speake with all reuerence: for if a subiect will not speake but
 reuerently to a King, much lesse should any flesh presume to talke with God as with his
 companion. 
 Craue in your prayer, not onely things spirituall, but also things temporall, sometimes of
 greater, and sometimes of lesse consequence; that yee may lay vp in store his grant of these
 things, for confirmation of your faith, and to be an arles-peny vnto you of his loue. Pray, as
 yee finde your heart moueth you, pro re nata : but see that yee sute no
 vnlawfull things, as reuenge, lust, or such like: for that prayer can not come of faith: and whatsoeuer is done without faith, is sinne , as the Apostle saith. 
 When ye obtaine your prayer, thanke him ioyfully therefore: if otherwaies, beare patiently,
 preassing to winne him with importunitie, as the widow did the vnrighteous Iudge: and if
 notwithstanding thereof yee be not heard, assure your selfe, God foreseeth that which yee aske
 is not for your weale: and learne in time, so to interprete all the aduersities that God shall
 send vnto you; so shall yee in the middest of them, not onely be armed with patience, but
 ioyfully lift vp your eyes from the present trouble, to the happie end that God will turne it
 to. And when ye finde it once so fall out by proofe, arme your selfe with the experience thereof against the next trouble, assuring your selfe, though yee cannot in time of
 the showre see through the cloude, yet in the end shall ye find, God sent if for your weale,
 as ye found in the former. 
 And as for conscience, which I called the conseruer of Religion, It is nothing else, but the
 light of knowledge that God hath planted in man, which euer watch- ing ouer all his actions,
 as it beareth him a ioyfull testimonie when he does right, so choppeth it him with a feeling
 that hee hath done wrong, when euer he commit- teth any sinne. And surely, although this
 conscience be a great torture to the wicked, yet is it as great a comfort to the godly, if we
 will consider it rightly. For haue wee not a great aduantage, that haue within our selues
 while wee liue here, a Count-booke and Inuentarie of all the crimes that wee shall bee accused
 of, either at the houre of our death, or at the Great day of Iudgement; which when wee please
 (yea though we forget) will chop, and remember vs to looke vpon it; that while we haue leasure
 and are here, we may remember to amend; and so at the day of our triall, compeare with new and white garments washed in the blood of the Lambe , as S. Iohn saith.
 Aboue all them, my Sonne, labour to keepe sound this conscience, which many prattle of, but
 ouer few feele: especially be carefull to keepe it free from two diseases, wherewith it vseth
 oft to be infected; to wit, Leaprosie, and Superstition; the former is the mother of Atheisme,
 the other of Heresies. By a leaprouse conscience, I meane a cauterized
 conscience , as Paul calleth it, being become senselesse of sinne, through sleeping in a carelesse
 securitie as King Dauids was after his murther and adulterie, euer til
 he was wakened by the Prophet Nathans similitude. And by superstition,
 I meane, when one re- straines himselfe to any other rule in the seruice of God, then is
 warranted by the word, the onely trew square of Gods seruice ? 
 As for a preseruatiue against this Leaprosie, remember euer once in the foure and twentie
 houres, either in the night, or when yee are at greatest quiet, to call your selfe to account
 of all your last dayes actions, either wherein ye haue com- mitted things yee should not, or
 omitted the things ye should doe, either in your Christian or Kingly calling: and in that
 account, let not your selfe be smoothed ouer with that flattering filauti/a , which is ouerkindly a sicknesse to all mankind:
 but censure your selfe as sharply, as if ye were your owne enemie: For if ye
 iudge your selfe, ye shall not be iudged , as the Apostle saith: and then according to your censure, reforme your actions as
 farre as yee may, eschewing euer wilfully and wittingly to contrare your conscience: For a
 small sinne wilfully committed, with a deliberate resolution to breake the bridle of
 conscience therein, is farre more grieuous before God, then a greater sinne committed in a
 suddaine passion, when conscience is asleepe. Remember therefore in all your actions, of the
 great ac- count that yee are one day to make: in all the dayes of your life, euer learning to
 die, and liuing euery day as it were you last; Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum. 
 
 
 And therefore, I would not haue you to pray with the Papists, to be preserued from suddaine
 death, but that God would giue you grace so to liue, as ye may euery houre of your life be
 ready for death: so shall ye attaine to the vertue of trew fortitude, neuer being afraid for
 the horrour of death, come when he list: And especially, beware to offend your conscience with
 vse of swearing or lying, suppose but in iest; for othes are but an vse, and a sinne cloathed
 with no delight nor gaine, and therefore the more inexcusable euen in the sight of men: and
 lying commeth also much of a vile vse, which banisheth shame: Therefore beware euen to deny
 the trewth, which is a sort of lie, that may best be eschewed by a person of your ranke. For
 if any thing be asked at you that yee thinke not meete to reueale, if yee say, that question
 is not pertinent for them to aske, who dare ex- amine you further ? and vsing sometimes this
 answere both in trew and false things that shall be asked at you, such vnmanerly people will
 neuer be the wiser thereof. 
 And for keeping your conscience sound from that sickenesse of superstition, yee must neither
 lay the safetie of your conscience vpon the credit of your owne conceits, nor yet of other
 mens humors, how great doctors of Diuinitie that euer they be; but yee must onely ground it
 vpon the expresse Scripture: for conscience not grounded vpon sure knowledge, is either an
 ignorant fantasie, or an arrogant vanitie. Beware therefore in this case with two extremities:
 the one, to beleeue with the Papists; the Churches authority, better then your owne knowledge;
 the other, to leane with the Anabaptists, to your owne conceits and dreamed reue- lations. 
 But learne wisely to discerne betwixt points of saluation and indifferent things, betwixt
 substance and ceremonies; and betwixt the expresse commandement and will of God in his word,
 and the inuention or ordinance of man; since all that is necessarie for saluation is contained
 in the Scripture: For in any thing that is expressely commanded or prohibited in the booke of
 God, ye cannot be ouer precise, euen in the least thing; counting euery sinne, not according
 to the light estimation and common vse of it in the world, but as the booke of God counteth of
 it. But as for all other things not contained in the scripture, spare not to vse or alter
 them, as the necessitie of the time shall require. And when any of the spirituall
 office-bearers in the Church, speake vnto you any thing that is well war- ranted by the word,
 reuerence and obey them as the heraulds of the most high God: but, if passing that bounds,
 they vrge you to embrace any of their fantasies in the place of Gods word, or would colour
 their particulars with a pretended zeal, acknowledge them for no other then vaine men,
 exceeding the bounds of their calling; and according to your office, grauely and with
 authoritie redact them in order againe. 
 To conclude then, both this purpose of conscience, and the first part of this booke, keepe
 God more sparingly in your mouth, but abundantly in your heart: be precise in effect, but
 sociall in shew: kythe more by your deeds then by your wordes, the loue of vertue
 and hatred of vice: and delight more to be godly and vertuous indeed, then to be thought and
 called so; expecting more for your praise and reward in heauen, then heere: and apply to all
 your outward actions Christs command, to pray and giue your almes secretly: So shal ye on the
 one part be inwardly garnished with trew Christian humilitie, not outwardly (with the proud
 Pharisie) glorying in your godlinesse; but saying, as Christ commandeth vs all, when we haue
 done all that we can, Inutiles serui
 sumus: 
 And on the other part, yee shall
 eschew outwardly before the world, the suspition of filthie proude hypo- crisie, and
 deceitfull dissimulation.

OF A KINGS DVETIE IN HIS OFFICE. The Second Booke. 
 BVT as ye are clothed with two callings, so must ye be alike careful for the dis- charge of
 them both: that as yee are a good Christian, so yee may be a good King, discharging your
 Office (as I shewed before) in the points of Iustice and Equitie: which in two sundrie waies
 ye must doe: the one, in establishing and executing, (which is the life of the Law) good Lawes
 among your people: the other, by
 your behauiour in your owne person, and with your seruants, to teach your people by your
 example: for people are naturally
 inclined to counterfaite (like apes) their Princes maners, according to the notable saying of
 Plato , ex-
 pressed by the Poet -
 
 
 
 Componitur orbis 
 Regis ad exemplum, nec sic infiectere sensus 
 Humanos edicta valent, quam vita regentis. 
 
 
 Claudian in 4. cons. Hon. 
 


 

 For the part of making, and executing of Lawes, consider first the trew dif- ference betwixt
 a lawfull good King, and an vsurping Tyran, and yee shall the more easily vnderstand your
 duetie herein: for contraria iuxta se posita magis
 elucescunt . The one acknowledgeth himselfe ordained for his people, hauing
 receiued from God a burthen of gouernment, whereof he must be countable: the other thinketh his people ordeined for him, a prey to
 his passions and inordi- nate appetites, as the fruites of his magnanimitie: And therefore, as their ends are
 directly contrarie, so are their whole actions, as meanes, whereby they preasse to attaine to
 their endes. A good King, thinking his highest honour to consist in the due discharge of his
 calling, emploieth all his studie and paines, to procure and maintaine, by the making and
 execution of good Lawes, the well-fare and peace of his people; and as their naturall father and kindly Master, thinketh his
 greatest contentment standeth in their prosperitie, and his greatest suretie in hauing their
 hearts, subiecting his owne priuate affections and appetites to the weale and
 standing of his Subiects, euer thinking common interesse his chiefest particular: where by the contrarie, an vsurping
 Tyran, thinking his greatest honour and felicitie to consist in attaining per fas, vel nefas to his ambi- tious pretences,
 thinketh neuer himselfe sure, but by the dissention and factions among his people, and
 counterfaiting the Saint while he once creepe in credite, will then (by inuerting all good
 Lawes to serve onely for his vnrulie priuate affec- tions) frame the common-weale euer to
 aduance his particular: building his suretie vpon his peoples miserie: and in the end (as a step-father and an vncouth
 hireling) make vp his owne hand vpon the ruines of the Republicke. And ac- cording to their actions, so receiue they their
 reward: For a good King (after a happie and famous reigne) dieth in peace, lamented by his
 subiects, and admired by his neighbours; and leauing a reuerent renowne behinde him in earth,
 ob- taineth the Crowne of eternall felicitie in heauen. And although some of them (which falleth out very rarelie) may be cut off
 by the treason of some vnnaturall subiects, yet liueth their fame after them, and some notable
 plague faileth neuer to ouertake the committers in this life, besides their infamie to all
 posterities here- after: Where by the contrarie, a Tyrannes miserable and infamous life,
 armeth in end his owne Subiects to become his burreaux: and although that rebellion be euer vnlawfull on their part, yet is
 the world so wearied of him, that his fall is little meaned by the rest of his Subjects, and
 but smiled at by his neighbours. And
 besides the infamous memorie he leaueth behind him here, and the endlesse paine hee sustaineth
 hereafter, it oft falleth out, that the committers not onely escape vnpunished, but farther,
 the fact will remaine as allowed by the Law in diuers aages thereafter. It is easie then for
 you (my Sonne) to make a choise of one of these two sorts of rulers, by following the way of
 vertue to establish your standing; yea, in case ye fell in the high way, yet should it be with
 the honourable report, and iust regrate of all honest men. 
 And therefore to returne to my purpose anent the gouernement of your Sub- iects, by making
 and putting good Lawes to execution; I remit the making of them to your owne discretion, as ye
 shall finde the necessitie of new-rising corrup- tions to require them: for, ex malis moribus bonae leges natae sunt : besides,
 that in this country, wee haue alreadie moe good Lawes then are well execute, and am onely to
 insist in your forme of gouernment anent their execution. Onely re- member, that as
 Parliaments haue bene ordained for making of Lawes, so ye abuse not their institution, in
 holding them for any mens particulars: For as a Parliament is the honourablest and highest
 iudgement in the land (as being the Kings head Court) if it be well vsed, which is by making
 of good Lawes in it; so is it the in-iustest Iudgement-seat that may be, being abused to mens
 particulars: irreuocable decreits against particular parties, being giuen therein vnder colour
 of generall Lawes, and oft-times th'Estates not knowing themselues whom thereby
 they hurt. And therefore hold no
 Parliaments, but for necessitie of new Lawes, which would be but seldome: for few Lawes and
 well put in execution, are best in a well ruled common-weale. As for the matter of
 fore-faltures, which also are done in Parliament, it is not good tigging with these things;
 but my aduice is, ye fore-fault none but for such odious crimes as may make them vn- worthie
 euer to be restored againe: And for smaller offences, ye haue other penalties sharpe enough to be vsed
 against them. 
 And as for the execution of good Lawes, whereat I left, remember that among the differences
 that I put betwixt the formes of the gouernment of a good King, and an vsurping Tyran; I shew
 how a Tyran would enter like a Saint while he found himselfe fast vnder-foot, and then would
 suffer his vnrulie affections to burst foorth. Therefore be yee contrare at your first entrie
 to your Kingdome, to that Quinquennium
 Neronis , with his tender hearted wish, V ellem nescirem literas , in giuing the Law full execution against all breakers thereof but excep-
 tion. For since ye come
 not to your reigne precario , nor by conquest, but by right and due
 discent; feare no vproares for doing of iustice, since ye may assure your selfe, the most part
 of your people will euer naturally fauour Iustice: pro- uiding alwaies, that ye doe it onely for loue to Iustice, and not for
 satisfying any particular passions of yours, vnder colour thereof: otherwise, how iustly that euer the offender deserue it,
 ye are guiltie of murther before God: For ye must consider, that God euer looketh to your
 inward intention in all your actions. 
 And when yee haue by the feueritie of Iustice once setled your countries, and made them know
 that ye can strike, then may ye thereafter all the daies of your life mixe Iustice with
 Mercie, punishing or sparing, as ye shall finde the crime to haue bene wilfully or rashly
 committed, and according to the by-past behauiour of the committer. For if otherwise ye
 kyth your clemencie at the first, the of- fences would soone come to such heapes, and the
 contempt of you grow so great, that when ye would fall to punish, the number of them to be
 punished, would exceed the innocent; and yee would be troubled to resolue whom-at to begin:
 and against your nature would be compelled then to wracke many, whom the chastisement of few
 in the beginning might haue preserued. But in this, my ouer- deare bought experience may serue
 you for a sufficient lesson: For I confesse, where I thought (by being gracious at the
 beginning) to win all mens hearts to a louing and willing obedience, I by the contrary found,
 the disorder of the coun- trie, and the losse of my thankes to be all my reward. 
 But as this seuere Iustice of yours vpon all offences would bee but for a time, (as I haue
 alreadie said) so is there some horrible crimes that yee are bound in conscience neuer to
 forgiue: such as Witch-craft, wilfull murther, Incest, (es- pecially within the degrees of
 consanguinitie) Sodomie, poisoning, and false coine. As for offences against your owne person
 and authoritie, since the fault concern- eth your selfe, I remit to your owne
 choise to punish or pardon therein, as your heart serueth you, and according to the
 circumstances of the turne, and the qualitie of the committer. 
 Here would I also eike another crime to bee vnpardonable, if I should not be thought
 partiall: but the fatherly loue I beare you, will make mee breake the bounds of shame in
 opening it vnto you. It is then, the false and vnreuerent writing or speaking of malicious men
 against your Parents and Predecessors: ye know the command in Gods lawe, Honour your Father and Mother : 
 and con- sequently, sen ye are the lawful magistrate, suffer not both your Princes and your
 Parents to be dishonoured by any; especially, sith the example also toucheth your selfe, in
 leauing thereby to your successors, the measure of that which they shal mete out againe to you
 in your like behalfe. I graunt wee
 haue all our faults, which, priuately betwixt you and God, should serue you for examples to
 meditate vpon, and mend in your person; but should not be a matter of discourse to others
 whatsoeuer. And sith ye are come of as honourable Predecessours as any Prince liuing, represse
 the insolence of such, as vnder pretence to taxe a vice in the per- son, seeke craftily to
 staine the race, and to steale the affection of the people from their posteritie: For how can
 they loue you, that hated them whom-of ye are come ? Wherefore destroy men innocent young
 sucking Wolues and Foxes, but for the hatred they beare to their race ? and why wil a coult of
 a Courser of Naples, giue a greater price in a market, then an Asse-colt, but for loue of the
 race ? It is therefore a thing monstrous, to see a man loue the childe, and hate the Parents:
 as on the other part, the infaming and making odious of the parents, is the readiest way to
 bring the sonne in contempt. And for conclusion of this point, I may also alledge my owne
 experience: For besides the iudgments of God, that with my eyes I haue seene fall vpon all
 them that were chiefe traitours to my parents, I may iustly affirme, I neuer found yet a
 constant biding by me in all my straites, by any that were of perfite aage in my parents
 dayes, but onely by such as constantly bode by them; I meane specially by them that serued the
 Queene my mother: for so that I discharge my conscience to you, my Sonne, in reuealing to you
 the trewth, I care not, what any traitour or treason-allower thinke of it. 
 And although the crime of oppression be not in this ranke of vnpardonable crimes, yet the
 ouer-common vse of it in this nation, as if it were a vertue, es- pecially by the greatest
 ranke of subjects in the land, requireth the King to be a sharpe censurer thereof. Be diligent
 therefore to trie, and awfull to beate downe the hornes of proud oppressours: embrace the quarrell of the poore and
 distressed, as your owne particular, thinking it your greatest honour to represse the
 oppressours: care for the pleasure of
 none, neither spare ye anie paines in your owne person, to see their wrongs redressed: and remember of the honour-
 able stile giuen to my grand-father of worthie memorie, in being called the poore mans King . And as the most part of a Kings office, standeth in
 deciding that question of Meum and
 Tuum , among his subjects; so
 remember when ye sit in iudgement, that the Throne ye sit on is Gods, as Moyses saith, and sway neither to the
 right hand nor to the left; either louing the rich, or pittying the poore. Iustice should be
 blinde and friendlesse: it is not there ye should reward your friends, or seeke to crosse your
 enemies. 
 
 Here now speaking of oppressours and of iustice, the purpose leadeth me to speake of
 Hie-land and Border oppressions. As for the Hie-lands, I shortly com- prehend them all in two
 sorts of people: the one, that dwelleth in our maine land, that are barbarous for the most
 part, and yet mixed with some shewe of ciuilitie: the other, that dwelleth in the Iles, and
 are alluterly barbares, without any sort or shew of ciuilitie. For the first sort, put
 straitly to execution the Lawes made alreadie by me against their Ouer-lords, and the chiefes
 of their Clannes, and it will be no difficultie to danton them. As for the other sort, follow
 forth the course that I haue intended, in planting Colonies among them of answerable In-lands
 subiects, that within short time may reforme and ciuilize the best inclined among them;
 rooting out or transporting the barbarous and stubborne sort, and plant- ing ciuilitie in
 their roomes. 
 But as for the Borders, because I know, if ye enioy not this whole Ile, accord- ing to Gods
 right and your lineall discent, yee will neuer get leaue to brooke this North and barrennest
 part thereof; no, not your owne head whereon the Crowne should stand; I neede not in that case
 trouble you with them: for then they will be the middest of the Ile, and so as easily ruled as
 any part thereof. 
 And that yee may the readier with wisedome and Iustice gouerne your sub- iects, by knowing
 what vices they are naturallie most inclined to, as a good Phy- sician, who must first know
 what peccant humours his Patient naturallie is most subiect vnto, before he can begin his
 cure: I shall therefore shortly
 note vnto you, the principall faults that euery ranke of the people of this countrey is most
 affected vnto. And as for England , I will not speake be-gesse of them,
 neuer hauing been among them, although I hope in that God, who euer fauoureth the right,
 before I die, to be as well acquainted with their fashions. 
 As the whole Subiects of our countrey (by the ancient and fundamentall policie of our
 Kingdome) are diuided into three estates, so is euerie estate hereof generally subiect to some
 speciall vices; which in a maner by long habitude, are thought rather vertue then vice among
 them; not that euerie particular man in any of these rankes of men, is subiect vnto them, for
 there is good and euill of all sorts; but that I meane, I haue found by experience, these
 vices to haue taken greatest holde with these rankes of men. 
 And first, that I prejudge not the Church of her ancient priuiledges, reason would shee
 should haue the first place for orders sake, in this catalogue. 
 
 The naturall sickenesse that hath euer troubled, and beene the decay of all the Churches,
 since the beginning of the world, changing the candlesticke from one to another, as Iohn
 saith, hath beene Pride, Ambition, and Auarice: and now last, these same infirmities wrought
 the ouerthrow of the Popish Church, in this countrey and diuers others. But the reformation of
 Religion in Scotland , being extraordinarily wrought by God, wherin many
 things were inordinately done by a popular tumult and rebellion, of such as blindly were doing
 the worke of God, but clogged with their owne passions and particular respects, as well
 appeared by the destruction of our policie, and not proceeding from the Princes order, as it
 did in our neighbour countrey of England , as likewise in Denmarke , and sundry parts of Germanie ; some fierie
 spirited men in the ministerie, got such a guiding of the people at that time of confusion, as
 finding the gust of gouernment sweete, they begouth to fantasie to themselues a Democraticke
 forme of gouernment: and hauing (by the iniquitie of time) beene ouerwell baited vpon the
 wracke, first of my Grandmother, and next of mine owne mother, and after vsurping the libertie
 of the time in my long minoritie, setled themselues so fast vpon that imagined Democracie, as
 they fed themselues with the hope to become Tribuni
 plebis : and so in a popular gouernment by leading the people by the nose, to
 beare the sway of all the rule. And for this cause, there neuer rose faction in the time of my
 minoritie, nor trouble sen-syne, but they that were vpon that factious part, were euer
 carefull to perswade and allure these vnruly spirits among the ministerie, to spouse that
 quarrell as their owne: where-through I was ofttimes calumniated in their populare Sermons,
 not for any euill or vice in me, but because I was a King, which they thought the highest
 euill. And because they were ashamed to professe this quarrel, they were busie to look
 narrowly in all my actions; and I warrant you a mote in my eye, yea a false report, was matter
 enough for them to worke vpon: and yet for all their cunning, whereby they pretended to
 distinguish the lawfulnesse of the office, from the vice of the person, some of them would
 sometimes snapper out well grossely with the trewth of their intentions, informing the people,
 that all Kings and Princes were naturally enemies to the libertie of the Church, and could
 neuer patiently beare the yoke of Christ: with such sound doctrine fed they their flockes. And
 because the learned, graue, and honest men of the ministerie, were euer ashamed and offended
 with their temeritie and pre- sumption, preassing by all good meanes by their authoritie and
 example, to re- duce them to a greater moderation; there could be no way found out so meete in
 their conceit, that were turbulent spirits among them, for maintaining their plots, as paritie
 in the Church: whereby the ignorants were emboldened (as bairdes) to crie the learned, godly,
 and modest out of it: paritie the mother of confusion, and enemie to Vnitie, which is the
 mother of order: For if by the example thereof, once established in the Ecclesiasticall
 gouernment, the Politicke and ciuill estate should be drawen to the like, the great confusion
 that thereupon would arise may easily be discerned. Take heede therefore (my Sonne) to such
 Puritanes, verie pestes in the Church and Common-weale, whom no deserts can
 oblige, neither oathes or promises binde, breathing nothing but sedition and calumnies,
 aspiring without measure, railing without reason, and making their owne imaginations (without
 any warrant of the word) the square of their con- science. I protest before the great God, and
 since I am here as vpon my Testa- ment, it is no place for me to lie in, that ye shall neuer
 finde with any Hie-land or Border-theeues greater ingratitude, and moe lies and vile
 periuries, then with these phanaticke spirits: And suffer not the principals of them to brooke
 your land, if ye like to sit at rest; except yee would keepe them for trying your pa- tience,
 as Socrates did an euill wife. 
 
 And for preseruatiue against their poison, entertaine and aduance the godly, learned and
 modest men of the ministerie, whom-of (God be praised) there lacketh not a sufficient number:
 and by their prouision to Bishoprickes and Benefices (annulling that vile acte of Annexation,
 if ye finde it not done to your hand) yee shall not onely banish their conceited paritie,
 whereof I haue spoken, and their other imaginarie grounds; which can neither stand with the
 order of the Church, nor the peace of a commonweale and well ruled Monarchie: but ye shall
 also re- establish the olde institution of three Estates in Parliament, which can no other-
 wise be done: But in this I hope (if God spare me dayes) to make you a faire entrie, alwayes
 where I leaue, follow ye my steps. 
 And to end my aduice anent the Church estate, cherish no man more then a good Pastor, hate
 no man more then a proude Puritane; thinking it one of your fairest styles, to be called a
 louing nourish-father to the Church, seeing all the Churches within your dominions planted
 with good Pastors, the Schooles (the seminarie of the Church) maintained, the doctrine and
 discipline preserued in puritie, according to Gods word, a sufficient prouision for their
 sustentation, a comely order in their policie, pride punished, humilitie aduanced, and they so
 to reuerence their superiours, and their flockes them, as the flourishing of your Church in
 pietie, peace, and learning, may be one of the chiefe points of your earthly glory, being euer
 alike ware with both the extremities; as well as yee re- presse the vaine Puritane, so not to
 suffer proude Papall Bishops; but as some for their qualities will deserue to bee preferred
 before others, so chaine them with such bondes as may preserue that estate from creeping to
 corruption. 
 The next estate now that by order commeth in purpose, according to their rankes in
 Parliament, is the Nobilitie, although second in ranke, yet ouer farre first in greatnesse and
 power, either to doe good or euill, as they are inclined. 
 The naturall sickenesse that I haue perceiued this estate subiect to in my time, hath beene,
 a fectlesse arrogant conceit of their greatnes and power; drinking in with their very
 nourish-milke, that their honor stood in committing three points of iniquitie: to thrall by
 oppression, the meaner sort that dwelleth neere them, to their seruice and following, although
 they holde nothing of them: to maintaine their seruants and dependers in any
 wrong, although they be not answerable to the lawes (for any body will maintaine his man in a
 right cause) and for anie dis- pleasure, that they apprehend to be done vnto them by their
 neighbour, to take vp a plaine feide against him; and (without respect to God, King, or
 common- weale) to bang it out brauely, hee and all his kinne, against him and all his: yea
 they will thinke the King farre in their common, in-case they agree to grant an assurance to a
 short day, for keeping of the peace: where, by their naturall dewtie, they are oblished to
 obey the lawe, and keepe the peace all the daies of their life, vpon the perill of their verie
 craigges. 
 For remeid to these euils in their estate, teach your Nobilitie to keepe your lawes as
 precisely as the meanest; feare
 not their orping or beeing discontented, as long as yee rule well; for their pretended
 reformation of Princes taketh neuer effect, but where euill gouernement precedeth. Acquaint
 your selfe so with all the honest men of your Barrons and Gentlemen, and be in your giuing
 accesse so open and affable to euery ranke of honest persons, as may make them peart with- out
 scarring at you, to make their owne suites to you themselues, and not to em- ploy the great
 Lordes their intercessours; for intercession to Saints is Papistrie: so shall ye bring to a measure
 their monstrous backes. And for their barbarous feides, put the lawes to due execution made by
 mee there-anent; beginning euer rathest at him that yee loue best, and is most oblished vnto
 you; to make him an example to the rest. For yee shall make all your reformations to beginne
 at your elbow, and so by degrees to flow to the extremities of the land. And rest not, vntill
 yee roote out these barbarous feides; that their effects may bee as well smoared downe, as
 their barbarous name is vnknowen to anie other nation: For if this Treatise were written
 either in French or Latine, I could not get them named vnto you but by circumlocution. And for
 your easier abolishing of them, put sharpelie to execution my lawes made against Gunnes and
 traiterous Pisto- lets; thinking in your heart, tearming in your speech, and vsing by your
 punish- ments, all such as weare and vse them, as brigands and cut-throates. 
 On the other part, eschew the other extremitie, in lightlying and contemning your Nobilitie.
 Remember howe that errour brake the King my grand-fathers heart. But consider that vertue
 followeth oftest noble blood: the worthinesse of their antecessors craueth a reuerent regard
 to be had vnto them: honour them therfore that are obedient to the law among them, as
 Peeres and Fathers of your land: the more frequently that your Court can bee garnished with
 them; thinke it the more your honour; 
 acquainting and employing them in all your greatest affaires; sen it is, they must be your
 armes and executers of your lawes: and so vse your selfe louinglie to the obedient, and
 rigorously to the stubborne, as may make the greatest of them to thinke, that the chiefest
 point of their honour, stand- eth in striuing with the meanest of the land in humilitie
 towards you, and obedi- ence to your Lawes: beating euer in their eares, that one
 of the principall points of seruice that ye craue of them, is, in their persons to practise,
 and by their power to procure due obedience to the Law; without the which, no seruice they can
 make, can be agreeable vnto you. 
 But the greatest hinderance to the execution of our Lawes in this countrie, are these
 heritable Shirefdomes and Regalities, which being in the hands of the great men, do wracke the
 whole countrie: For which I know no present remedie, but by taking the sharper account of them
 in their Offices; vsing all punishment against the slouthfull, that the Law will permit: and euer as they vaike, for any offences
 committed by them, dispone them neuer heritably againe: preassing, with time, to draw it to
 the laudable custome of England: which ye may the easilier doe, being King of both, as I hope
 in God ye shall. 
 And as to the third and last estate, which is our Burghes (for the small Bar- rones are but
 an inferiour part of the Nobilitie and of their estate) they are com- posed of two sorts of
 men; Merchants and Craftes-men: either of these sorts being subiect to their owne infirmities. 
 The Merchants thinke the whole common-weale ordeined for making them vp; and accounting it
 their lawfull gaine and trade, to enrich themselues vpon the losse of all the rest of the
 people, they transport from vs things necessarie; bringing backe sometimes vnnecessary things,
 and at other times nothing at all. They buy for vs the worst wares, and sell them at the
 dearest prices: and albeit the victuals fall or rise of their prices, according to the
 aboundance or skantnesse thereof; yet the prices of their wares euer rise, but neuer fall:
 being as constant in that their euill custome, as if is were a setled Law for them. They are
 also the speciall cause of the corruption of the coyne, transporting all our owne, and bring
 ing in forraine, vpon what price they please to set on it: For order putting to them, put the
 good Lawes in execution that are already made anent these abuses; but especially doe three
 things: Establish honest, diligent, but few Searchers, for many hands make slight worke; and
 haue an honest and diligent Thesaurer to take count of them: Permit and allure forraine
 Merchants to trade here: so shall ye haue best and best cheape wares, not buying them at the third hand:
 And set euery yeere downe a certaine price of all things; considering first, how it is in
 other countries: and the price set reasonably downe, if the Merchants will not bring them home
 on the price, cry forrainers free to bring them. 
 And because I haue made mention here of the coyne, make your money of fine Gold and Siluer;
 causing the people be payed with substance, and not abused with number: so shall ye enrich the
 common-weale, and haue a great treasure laid vp in store, if ye fall in warres or in any
 straites: For the making it baser, will breed your commoditie; but it is not to bee vsed, but
 at a great necessitie. 
 And the Craftes-men thinke, we should be content with their worke, how bad and deare soeuer
 it be: and if they in any thing
 be controlled, vp goeth the blew-blanket: But for their part, take example by
 ENGLAND, how it hath flour- ished both in wealth and policie, since the strangers Craftes-men
 came in among them: Therefore not onely permit, but allure strangers to come heere also; taking as strait order for repressing
 the mutining of ours at them, as was done in ENGLAND, at their first in-bringing there. 
 But vnto one fault is all the common people of this Kingdome subiect, as well burgh as land;
 which is, to iudge and speake rashly of their Prince, setting the Common-weale vpon foure
 props, as wee call it; euer wearying of the present estate, and desirous of nouelties. 2 For remedie whereof (besides the execution
 of Lawes that are to be used against vnreuerent speakers) I know no better meane, then so to
 rule, as may iustly stop their mouthes from all such idle and vnreuerent speeches; and so to
 prop the weale of your people, with prouident care for their good gouernment, that iustly, Momus himselfe may haue no ground to grudge at: and yet so to temper and
 mixe your seueritie with mildnes, that as the vniust railers may be restrained with a reuerent
 awe; so the good and louing Subjects, may not onely liue in suretie and wealth, but be stirred
 vp and inuited by your benigne courtesies, to open their mouthes in the iust praise of your so
 well mod- erated regiment. In respect
 whereof, and therewith also the more to allure them to a common amitie among themselues,
 certaine dayes in the yeere would be ap- pointed, for delighting the people with publicke
 spectacles of all honest games, and exercise of armes: as also for conueening of neighbours, for entertaining friendship and
 heartlinesse, by honest feasting and merrinesse: For I cannot see what greater superstition
 can be in making playes and lawfull games in Maie, and good cheere at Christmas, then in
 eating fish in Lent, and vpon Fridayes, the Papists as well vsing the one as the other: so
 that alwayes the Sabboths be kept holy, and no vnlawfull pastime be vsed: And as this forme of
 contenting the peoples mindes, hath beene vsed in all well gouerned Republicks: so will it
 make you to performe in your gouernment that olde good sentence, Omne tulit punctum, qui miscuit vtile
 dulci. 
 
 Ye see now (my Sonne) how for the zeale I beare to acquaint you with the plaine and single
 veritie of all things, I haue not spared to be something Satyricke, in touching well quickly
 the faults in all the estates of my kingdome: But I protest before God, I doe it with the
 fatherly loue that I owe to them all; onely hating their vices, whereof there is a good number
 of honest men free in euery estate. 
 And because, for the better reformation of all these abuses among your estates, it will be a
 great helpe vnto you, to be well acquainted with the nature and humours of all your Subjects,
 and to know particularly the estate of euery part of your dominions; I would therefore counsell you, once in the
 yeere to visite the principall parts of the countrey, ye shal be in for the time:
 and because I hope ye shall be
 King of moe countries then this, once in the three yeeres to visite all your Kingdomes; not
 lipening to Vice-royes, but hearing your selfe their complaints; and hauing ordinarie Councels
 and iustice-seates in euerie Kingdome, of their owne countriemen: and the principall matters
 euer to be de- cided by your selfe when ye come in those parts. 
 Ye haue also to consider, that yee must not onely bee carefull to keepe your subiects, from
 receiuing anie wrong of others within; but also yee must be care- ful to keepe them from the
 wrong of any forraine Prince without: sen the sword is giuen you by God not onely to reuenge
 vpon your owne subiects, the wrongs committed amongst themselues; but further, to reuenge and
 free them of for- raine iniuries done vnto them: And therefore warres vpon iust quarrels are
 law- ful: but aboue all, let not the wrong cause be on your side. 
 
 Vse all other Princes, as your brethren, honestly and kindely: Keepe precisely your promise
 vnto them, although to your hurt: Striue with euerie one of them in courtesie and
 thankefulnesse: and as
 with all men, so especially with them, bee plaine and trewthfull; keeping euer that Christain
 rule, to doe as yee would be done to : especially in counting rebellion
 against any other Prince, a crime against your owne selfe, because of the preparatiue. Supplie
 not therefore, nor trust not other Princes rebels; but pittie and succour all lawfull Princes
 in their troubles. But if any of them will not abstaine, notwithstanding what-soeuer your good
 deserts, to wrong you or your subjects, craue redresse at leasure; heare and
 doe all reason: and if no offer that is lawfull or honourable, can make him to abstaine, nor
 repaire his wrong doing; then for last refuge, commit the iustneffe of your cause to God,
 giuing first honestly vp with him, and in a publicke and honourable forme. 
 
 But omitting now to teach you the forme of making warres, because that arte is largely
 treated of by many, and is better learned by practise then speculation; I will onely set downe
 to you heere a few precepts therein. Let first the iustnesse of your cause be your greatest
 strength; and then omitte not to vse all lawfull meanes for backing of the same. Consult
 therefore with no Necromancier nor false Prophet, vpon the successe of your warres, remembring
 on king Saules 
 miserable end: but keepe your land
 cleane of all South-sayers, according to the commaund in the Law of God, dilated by Ieremie. Neither commit your quarrell to bee tried
 by a Duell: for beside that generally all Duell appeareth to bee vn- lawful, committing the
 quarrell, as it were, to a lot; whereof there is no warrant in the Scripture, since the
 abrogating of the olde Lawe: it is specially moste vn- lawfull in the person of a
 King; who being a
 publicke person hath no power therefore to dispose of himselfe, in respect, that to his
 preseruation or fall, the safetie or wracke of the whole common-weale is necessarily coupled,
 as the body is to the head. 
 Before ye take on warre, play the wise Kings part described by Christ; fore- seeing how ye
 may beare it out with all necessarie prouision: especially remem- ber, that money is Neruus belli . Choose old experimented Captaines, and yong able souldiers. Be
 extreamely strait and seuere in martiall Discipline, as well for keeping of order, which is as
 requisite as hardinesse in the warres, and punishing of slouth, which at a time may put the
 whole armie in hazard; as likewise for repressing of mutinies, which in warres are wonderfull
 dangerous. And looke to the Spaniard , whose great successe in all his
 warres, hath onely come through straitnesse of Discipline and order: for such errours may be
 committed in the warres, as cannot be gotten mended againe. 
 

 Be in your owne person walkrife, diligent, and painefull; vsing the aduice of such as are
 skilfullest in the craft, as ye must also doe in all other. Be homely with your souldiers as
 your companions, for winning their hearts; and extreamly liberall, for then is no time of
 sparing. Be cold and foreseeing in deuising, con- stant in your resolutions, and forward and
 quicke in your executions. Fortifie well your
 Campe, and assaile not rashly without an aduantage: neither feare not lightly your
 enemie. Be curious in deuising
 stratagems, but alwayes honestly: for of any thing they worke greatest effects in the warres,
 if secrecie be ioyned to inuention. And once or twise in your owne person hazard your selfe fairely; but, hauing
 acquired so the fame of courage and magnanimitie, make not a daily souldier of your selfe,
 exposing rashly your person to euery perill: but conserue your selfe thereafter for the weale
 of your people, for whose sake yee must more care for your selfe, then for your owne. 
 
 And as I haue counselled you to be slow in taking on a warre, so aduife I you to be slow in
 peace-making. Before ye agree, looke
 that the ground of your warres be satisfied in your peace; and that ye see a good suretie for
 you and your people: otherwaies a honourable and iust warre is more tollerable, then a dis-
 honourable and dis-aduantageous peace. 
 
 But it is not enough to a good King, by the scepter of good Lawes well execute to gouerne,
 and by force of armes to protect his people; if he ioyne not there- with his vertuous life in
 his owne person, and in the person of his Court and com- pany; by good example alluring his
 Subiects to the loue of vertue, and hatred of vice. And therefore (my Sonne) sith all people
 are naturally inclined to follow their Princes example (as I shewed you before)
 let it not be said, that ye command others to keepe the contrary course to that, which in your
 owne person ye prac- tise, making so your wordes and deeds to fight together: but by the contrary, let
 your owne life be a law-booke and a mirrour to your people; that therein they may read the
 practise of their owne Lawes; and therein they may see, by your image, what life they should
 leade. 
 And this example in your owne life and person, I likewise diuide in two parts: The first, in
 the gouernment of your Court and followers, in all godlinesse and vertue: the next, in hauing
 your owne minde decked and enriched so with all vertuous qualities, that therewith yee may
 worthily rule your people: For it is not ynough that ye haue and retaine (as prisoners) within
 your selfe neuer so many good qualities and vertues, except ye employ them, and set them on
 worke, for the weale of them that are committed to your charge: Virtutis enim laus omnis in actione consistit. 
 
 First then, as to the gouernment of your Court and followers, King Dauid sets downe the best precepts, that any wise and Christian King can practise in
 that point: For as yee ought to haue a great care for the ruling well of all your Subiects, so
 ought yee to haue a double care for the ruling well of your owne seruants; since vnto them yee are both a Politicke and
 Oeconomicke gouernour. And as euery one of the people will delite to follow the example of any
 of the Courteours, as well in euill as in good: so what crime so horrible can there be committed and ouer-seene in a Courteour,
 that will not be an exemplare excuse for any other boldly to commit the like ? And therfore in
 two points haue ye to take good heed anent your Court and houshold: first, in choosing them
 wisely; next, in carefully ruling them whom ye haue chosen. 
 It is an olde and trew saying, That a kindly Auer will neuer become a good horse: for albeit
 good education and company be great helpes to Nature, and education be therefore most iustly called altera natura , yet is it euill to get out of the flesh, that is bred in the bone, as the olde
 prouerbe sayth. Be very ware then in making choice of your seruants and companie: -

 
 
 
 Nam 
 Turpius eiicitur, quam non admittitur hospes: 
 
 
 Ouid. 5. de Trist. 
 



 and many respects may lawfully
 let an admission, that will not be sufficient causes of depriuation. 
 All your seruants and Court must be composed partly of minors, such as young Lords, to be
 brought vp in your company, or Pages and such like; and partly of men of perfit aage, for
 seruing you in such roumes, as ought to be filled with men of wisedome and discretion. For the
 first sort, ye can doe no more, but choose them within aage, that are come of a good and
 vertuous kinde, 
 In fide 
 
 parentum , as Baptisme is vsed: For
 though anima non venit ex
 traduce , but is
 immediatly created by God, and infused from aboue; yet it is most certaine, that vertue or
 vice will oftentimes, with the heritage, be transferred from the parents to the posteritie,
 and runne on a blood (as the Prouerbe is) the sickenesse of the minde becomming as kindly to
 some races, as these sickenesses of the body, that infect in the seede: Especially choose
 such minors as are come of a trew and hon- est race, and haue not had the house whereof they
 are descended, infected with falsehood. 
 
 And as for the other sort of your companie and seruants, that ought to be of perfit aage;
 first see that they be of a good fame and without blemish, otherwise, what can the people
 thinke, but that yee haue chosen a company vnto you, ac- cording to your owne humour, and so
 haue preferred these men, for the loue of their vices and crimes, that ye knew them to be
 guiltie of ? For the people that see you not within, cannot iudge of you, but according to the
 outward appearance of your actions and companie, which onely is subiect to their sight: And next, see that they be indued with such
 honest qualities, as are meete for such offices, as ye ordaine them to serue in; that your
 iudgement may be knowen in imploy- ing euery man according to his giftes: And shortly, follow good king Dauids counsell in the
 choise of your seruants, by setting your eyes vpon the faithfull and vpright of the land to
 dwell with you. 
 
 But here I must not forget to remember, and according to my fatherly authori- tie, to charge
 you to preferre specially to your seruice, so many as haue trewly serued me, and are able for
 it: the rest, honourably to reward them, preferring their posteritie before others, as
 kindliest: so shall ye not onely be best serued, (for if the haters of your parents cannot
 loue you, as I shewed before, it followeth of necessitie their louers must loue you) but
 further, ye shall kyth your thankefull memorie of your father, and procure the blessing of
 these olde seruants, in not missing their olde master in you; which otherwise would be turned
 in a prayer for me, and a curse for you. Vse them therefore when God shall call me, as the
 testimonies of your affection towards me; trusting and aduancing those farthest, whom I found
 faithfullest: which ye must not discerne by their rewards at my hand (for rewards, as they are
 called Bona fortune , so are they
 subiect vnto for- tune) but according to the trust I gaue them; hauing oft-times had better
 heart then hap to the rewarding of sundry: And on the other part, as I wish you to kyth your
 constant loue towards them that I loued, so desire I you to kyth in the same measure, your
 constant hatred to them that I hated: I meane, bring not home, nor restore not such, as ye
 finde standing banished or fore-faulted by me. The contrary would kyth in you ouer great a
 contempt of me, and lightnesse in your owne nature: for how can they be trew to
 the Sonne, that were false to the Father ? 
 But to returne to the purpose anent the choise of your seruants, yee shall by this wise
 forme of doing, eschew the inconuenients, that in my minoritie I fell in, anent the choise of
 my seruants: For by them that had the command where I was brought vp, were my seruants put
 vnto mee; not choosing them that were meetest to serue me, but whom they thought meetest to
 serue their turne about me, as kythed well in many of them at the first rebellion raised
 against mee, which com- pelled mee to make a great alteration among my seruants. And yet the
 example of that corruption made mee to be long troubled there-after with solliciters,
 recommending seruants vnto me, more for seruing in effect, their friends that put them in,
 then their master that admitted them. Let my example then teach you to follow the rules here
 set downe, choosing your seruants for your owne vse, and not for the vse of others: And since ye must bee communis parens to all your people, so choose your
 seruants indifferently out of all quarters; not respect- ing other mens appetites, but their
 owne qualities: For as ye must command all, so reason would, ye should be serued out of al, as
 ye please to make choice. 
 But specially take good heed to the choice of your seruants, that ye preferre to the offices
 of the Crowne and estate: for in other offices yee haue onely to take heede to your owne
 weale; but these concerne likewise the weale of your people; for the
 which yee must bee answerable to God. Choose then for all these Offices, men of knowen
 wisedome, honestie, and good conscience; well practised in the points of the craft, that yee
 ordaine them for, and free of all factions and partiali- ties; but specially free of that
 filthie vice of Flatterie, the pest of all Princes, and wracke of Republicks: For since in the first part of
 this Treatise, I fore-warned you to be at warre with your owne inward flatterer 4LXavrta , how much more should ye be at war with outward flatterers, who
 are nothing so sib to you, as your selfe is; by the selling of such counterfeit wares, onely
 preassing to ground their greatnesse vpon your ruines ? And therefore bee carefull to preferre none, as yee will bee answerable to God but
 onely for their worthinesse: But specially choose honest, diligent, meane, but responsall men,
 to bee your receiuers in money matters: meane I say, that ye may when yee please, take a
 sharpe ac- count of their intromission, without perill of their breeding any trouble to your
 estate: for this ouersight hath beene the greatest cause of my mis-thriuing in money matters.
 Especially, put neuer a forrainer, in any principall office of estate: for that will neuer
 faile to stirre vp sedition and enuie in the countrey- mens hearts, both against you and him:
 But (as I saide before) if God prouide you with moe countries then this; choose the borne-men
 of euery countrey, to bee your chief counsellers therein. 
 
 
 And for conclusion of my aduice anent the choice of your feruants, delight to be serued with
 men of the noblest blood that may bee had: for besides that their seruice shall breed you
 great good-will and least enuie, contrarie to that of start- vps; ye shall oft finde vertue
 follow noble races, as I haue said before speaking of the Nobilitie. 
 
 Now, as to the other point, anent your gouerning of your seruants when yee haue chosen them;
 make your Court and companie to bee a patterne of godlinesse and all honest vertues, to all
 the rest of the people . Bee a daily
 watch-man ouer your seruants, that they obey your lawes precisely: For how can your lawes bee kept in the countrey, if they
 be broken at your eare ? Punishing the breach thereof in a Courteour, more seuerely, then in
 the person of any other of your subiects: and aboue all, suffer none of them (by abusing their
 credite with you) to oppresse or wrong any of your subiects. Be homely or strange with them,
 as ye thinke their behauiour deserueth, and their nature may beare with. Thinke a quarrellous man a pest in your
 companie. Bee carefull euer to preferre the gentilest natured and trustiest, to the inwardest
 Offices about you, especially in your chalmer. Suffer none about you to meddle in any mens particulars, but like the Turkes
 Ianisares, let them know no father but you, nor particular but yours. And if any will medde in their
 kinne or friends quarrels, giue them their leaue: for since ye must be of no surname nor
 kinne, but equall to all honest men; it becommeth you not to bee followed with partiall or
 factious seruants. Teach obedience to your seruants, and not to thinke themselues ouer-wise:
 and, as when any of them
 deserueth it, ye must not spare to put them away, so, without a seene cause, change none of
 them. Pay them, as all others your subiects, with praemium or paena 
 as they deserue, which is the very ground-stone of good gouerne- ment. Employ euery man as ye
 thinke him qualified, but vse not one in all things, lest he waxe proude, and be enuied of his
 fellowes. Loue them best, that are plainnest with you, and disguise not the trewth for all
 their kinne: suffer none to be euill tongued, nor backbiters of them they hate: command a
 hartly and brotherly loue among all them that serue you. And shortly, maintaine peace in your Court, bannish
 enuie, cherish modestie, bannish deboshed insolence, foster humilitie, and represse pride:
 setting downe such a comely and honourable order in all the points of your seruice; that when
 strangers shall visite your Court, they may with the Queene of Sheba ,
 admire your wisedome in the glorie of your house, and comely order among your seruants. 
 But the principall blessing that yee can get of good companie, will stand in your marrying
 of a godly and vertuous wife: for shee must bee nearer vnto you, then any other
 companie, being Flesh of your flesh, and bone of your bone, as Adam saide of Heuah . And because I know not but God may call me, before ye be readie for
 Mariage; I will shortly set downe to you heere my aduice therein. 
 First of all consider, that Mariage is the greatest earthly felicitie or miserie, that can
 come to a man, according as it pleaseth God to blesse or curse the same. Since then without
 the blessing of GOD, yee cannot looke for a happie successe in Mariage, yee must bee carefull
 both in your preparation for it, and in the choice and vsage of your wife, to procure the
 same. By your preparation, I meane, that yee must keepe your bodie cleane and vnpolluted, till
 yee giue it to your wife, whom-to onely it belongeth. For how can ye iustly craue to bee
 ioyned with a pure virgine, if your bodie be polluted ? why should the one halfe bee cleane,
 and the other defiled ? And although I know, fornication is thought but a light and a veniall
 sinne, by the most part of the world, yet remember well what I said to you in my first Booke
 anent conscience, and count euery sinne and breach of Gods law, not according as the vaine
 world esteemeth of it, but as God the Iudge and maker of the lawe accounteth of the same.
 Heare God commanding by the mouth of Paul , to abstaine from fornication , declaring that the fornicator shall not
 inherite the Kingdome of heauen: and by the mouth of Iohn , reckoning our fornication amongst
 other grieuous sinnes, that debarre the committers amongst dogs and swine,
 from entry in that spirituall and heauenly Ierusalem . And consider, if a man shall once take vpon him, to count that light,
 which God calleth heauie; and veniall that, which God calleth grieuous; beginning first to
 measure any one sinne by the rule of his lust and appetites, and not of his conscience; what
 shall let him to doe so with the next, that his affections shall stirre him to, the like
 reason seruing for all: and so to goe forward till he place his whole corrupted affections in
 Gods roome ? And then what shall come of him; but, as a man giuen ouer to his owne filthy
 affections, shall perish into them ? And because wee are all of that nature, that sibbest
 examples touch vs neerest, consider the difference of successe that God granted in the
 Mariages of the King my grand-father, and me your owne father: the reward of his
 incontinencie, (proceeding from his euill education) being the suddaine death at one time of
 two pleasant yong Princes; and a daughter onely borne to succeed to him, whom hee had neuer
 the hap, so much as once to see or blesse before his death: leauing a double curse behinde him
 to the land, both a Woman of sexe, and a new borne babe of aage to reigne ouer them. And as
 for the blessing God hath bestowed on mee, in granting me both a greater continencie, and the
 fruits following there-upon, your selfe, and sib folkes to you, are (praise be to God)
 sufficient witnesses: which, I hope the same God of his infinite mercie, shall continue and
 increase, without repentance to me and my posteritie. Be not ashamed then, to keepe cleane
 your body, which is the Temple of the holy Spirit, notwithstanding all vaine allurements to the contrary, discerning
 trewly and wisely of euery vertue and vice, according to the trew qualities thereof, and not
 according to the vaine conceits of men.. 
 As for your choise in Mariage, respect chiefly the three causes, wherefore Mariage was first
 ordeined by God; and then ioyne three accessories, so farre as they may be obtained, not
 derogating to the principalles. 
 The three causes it was ordeined for, are, for staying of lust, for procreation of children,
 and that man should by his Wife, get a helper like himselfe. Deferre not then to Marie till
 your aage: for it is ordeined for quenching the lust of your youth: Especially a King must tymouslie Marie for the weale of
 his people. Neither Marie yee, for any
 accessory cause or worldly respects, a woman vnable, either through aage, nature, or accident,
 for procreation of children: for in a King that were a double fault, as well against his owne
 weale, as against the weale of his people. Neither also Marie one of knowne euill conditions,
 or vicious education: for the woman is ordeined to be a helper, and not a hinderer to man. 
 The three accessories, which as I haue said, ought also to be respected, with- out
 derogating to the principall causes, are beautie, riches, and friendship by alliance, which
 are all blessings of God. For beautie increaseth your loue to your Wife, contenting you the
 better with her, without caring for others: and riches and great alliance, doe both make her
 the abler to be a helper vnto you. But if ouer great respect being had to these accessories, the principall causes
 bee ouer- seene (which is ouer oft practised in the world) as of themselues they are a
 blessing being well vsed; so the abuse of them will turne them in a curse. For what can all
 these worldly respects auaile, when a man shall finde himselfe coupled with a diuel, to be one
 flesh with him, and the halfe marrow in his bed ? Then (though too late) shall he finde that
 beautie without bountie, wealth without wisdome, and great friendship without grace and
 honestie; are but faire shewes, and the deceitfull masques of infinite miseries. 
 But haue ye respect, my Sonne, to these three speciall causes in your Mariage, which flow
 from the first institution thereof, & caetera
 omnia adjicientur vobis. 
 And therefore I would rathest haue you to Marie one that were fully of your owne Religion; her
 ranke and other qualities being agreeable to your estate. For although that to my great
 regrate, the number of any Princes of power and ac- count, professing our Religion, bee but
 very small; and that therefore this aduice seemes to be the more strait and difficile: yet ye
 haue deeply to weigh, and con- sider vpon these doubts, how ye and your wife can bee of one
 flesh, and keepe vnitie betwixt you, being members of two opposite Churches: disagreement in
 Religion bringeth euer with it, disagreement in maners; and the dissention be- twixt your
 Preachers and hers, wil breed and foster a dissention among your subiects, taking their
 example from your family; besides the perill of the euill education of your children. Neither
 pride you that ye wil be able to frame and make her as ye please: that deceiued
 Salomon the wisest King that euer was; the grace of Perseuerance, not
 being a flower that groweth in our garden. 
 Remember also that Mariage is one of the greatest actions that a man doeth in all his time,
 especially in taking of his first Wife: and if hee Marie first basely beneath his ranke, he
 will euer be the lesse accounted of thereafter. And lastly, remember to choose your Wife as I
 aduised you to choose your seruants: that she be of a whole and cleane race, not subiect to
 the hereditary sicknesses, either of the soule or the body: For if a man wil be careful to
 breed horses and dogs of good kinds, how much more careful should he be, for the breed of his
 owne loines? So shal ye in your Mariage haue respect to your conscience, honour,
 and naturall weale in your successours. 
 When yee are Maried, keepe inuiolably your promise made to God in your Mariage; which
 standeth all in doing of one thing, and abstayning from another: to treat her in all things as
 your wife, and the halfe of your selfe; and to make your body (which then is no more yours,
 but properly hers) common with none other. I trust I need not to insist here to disswade you from the filthy vice of
 adulterie: remember onely what solemne promise yee make to God at your Mari- age: and since it
 is onely by the force of that promise that your children succeed to you, which otherwayes they
 could not doe; aequitie and reason would, ye should keepe your part thereof. God is euer a seuere auenger of all
 periuries; and it is no oath made in iest, that giueth power to children to succeed to great
 kingdomes. Haue the King my grand-fathers example before your eyes, who by his adulterie, bred
 the wracke of his lawfull daughter and heire; in begetting that bastard, who vnnaturally
 rebelled, and procured the ruine of his owne Souerane and sister. And what good her posteritie
 hath gotten sensyne, of some of that vn- lawfull generation, Bothuell 
 his treacherous attempts can beare witnesse. Keepe praecisely then your promise made at
 Mariage, as ye would wish to be partaker of the blessing therein. 
 And for your behauiour to your Wife, the Scripture can best giue you counsell therein: Treat
 her as your owne flesh, command her as her Lord, cherish her as your helper, rule her as your
 pupill, and please her in all things reasonable; but teach her not to be curious in things
 that belong her not: 4 Ye are the head, shee is your body; It is your office to
 command, and hers to obey; but yet with such a sweet harmonie, as shee should be as ready to
 obey, as ye to command; as willing to follow, as ye to go before; your loue being wholly knit
 vnto her, and all her affections louingly bent to follow your will. 
 And to conclude, keepe specially three rules with your Wife: first, suffer her neuer to
 meddle with the Politicke gouernment of the Commonweale, but holde her at the Oeconomicke rule
 of the house; and yet all to be subiect to your direc- tion: keepe carefully good and chaste company about her, for women are the frailest
 sexe; and be neuer both angry at once, but when ye see her in passion, ye should with reason
 danton yours: for both when yee are setled, ye are meetest to iudge of her errours; and when
 she is come to her selfe, she may be best made to apprehend her offence, and reuerence your
 rebuke. 
 If God send you succession, be carefull for their vertuous education: loue them as ye ought,
 but let them know as much of it, as the gentlenesse of their nature will deserue; contayning
 them euer in a reuerent loue and feare of you. And in case it please God to prouide you to all
 these three Kingdomes, make your eldest sonne Isaac , leauing him all
 your kingdomes; and prouide the rest with priuate possessions: Otherwayes by deuiding your
 kingdomes, yee shall leaue the seed of diuision and discord among your posteritie; as befell to this Ile, by the diuision and assignement thereof, to the three
 sonnes of Brutus, Locrine, Albanact , and Camber . But if God giue you not
 succession, defraud neuer the nearest by right, what-soeuer conceit yee haue of the person:
 For Kingdomes are euer at Gods disposition, and in that case we are but liue-rentars, lying no
 more in the Kings, nor peoples hands to dispossesse the righteous heire. 
 And as your company should be a paterne to the rest of the people, so should your person be
 a lampe and mirrour to your company: giuing light to your seruants to walke in the path of vertue, and
 representing vnto them such worthie qualities, as they should preasse to imitate. 
 I need not to trouble you with the particular discourse of the foure Cardinall vertues, it
 is so troden a path: but I will shortly say vnto you; make one of them, which is Temperance,
 Queene of all the rest within you. I meane not by the vulgar interpretation of Temperance,
 which onely consists in gustu &
 tactu , by the moderating of these two senses: but, I
 meane of that wise moderation, that first commaunding your selfe, shall as a Queene, command
 all the affections and passions of your minde, and as a Phisician, wisely mixe all your
 actions according thereto. Therefore, not onely in all your affections and passions, but euen
 in your most vertuous actions, make euer moderation to be the chiefe ruler: For although
 holinesse be the first and most requisite qualitie of a Christian, as pro- ceeding from a
 feeling feare and trew knowledge of God: yet yee remember how in the conclusion of my first
 booke, I aduised you to moderate al your outward actions flowing there-fra. The like say I now
 of Iustice, which is the greatest vertue that properly belongeth to a Kings office. 
 Vse Iustice, but with such moderation, as it turne not in Tyrannie: otherwaies summum Ius , is summa iniuria . 6 As for example: if a man of a knowen honest life, be inuaded by brigands or
 theeues for his purse, and in his owne defence slay one of them, they beeing both
 moe in number, and also knowen to bee deboshed and insolent liuers; where by the contrarie,
 hee was single alone, beeing a man of sound reputation: yet because they were not at the home,
 or there was no eye-witnesse present that could verifie their first inuading of him, shall hee
 there- fore lose his head ? And likewise, by the law-burrowes in our lawes, men are prohibited
 vnder great pecuniall paines, from any wayes inuading or molesting their neighbours person or
 bounds: if then his horse breake the halter, and pastour in his neighbours medow, shall he pay
 two or three thousand pounds for the wantonnesse of his horse, or the weaknesse of his halter
 ? Surely no: for lawes are ordained as rules of vertuous and sociall liuing, and not to bee
 snares to trap your good subjects: and therefore the lawe must be interpreted according to the
 meaning, and not to the literall sense thereof: Nam
 ratio est anima legis . 
 
 And as I said of Iustice, so say I of Clemencie, Magnanimitie, Liberalitie, Constancie,
 Humilitie, and all other Princely vertues; Nam in
 medio stat virtus. And it is but the craft of the Diuell that falsly
 coloureth the two vices that are on either side thereof, with the borrowed titles of it,
 albeit in very deede they haue no affinitie therewith and the two extremities themselues,
 although they seeme contrarie, yet growing to the height, runne euer both in one: For in infinitis omnia concurrunt ; and what
 difference is betwixt extreame tyrannie, delighting to destroy all mankinde; and extreame
 slackenesse of punishment, permitting euery man to tyrannize ouer his companion ? Or what
 differeth extreame pro- digalitie, by wasting of all to possesse nothing; from extreame
 niggardnesse, by hoarding vp all to enioy nothing; like the Asse that carying victuall on her
 backe, is like to starue for hunger, and will bee glad of thrissels for her part? And what is
 betwixt the pride of a glorious Nebuchadnezzar , and the preposterous
 hu- militie of one of the proud Puritanes, claiming to their Paritie, and crying, Wee are all
 but vile wormes, and yet will iudge and giue Law to their King, but will be iudged nor
 controlled by none ? Surely there is more pride vnder such a ones blacke bonnet, then vnder
 Alexander the great his Diademe, as was said of Diogenes in the like case. 
 But aboue all vertues, study to know well your owne craft, which is to rule your people. And
 when I say this, I bid you know all crafts: For except ye know euery one, how can yee controll
 euery one, which is your proper office ? Therefore besides your education, it is necessarie
 yee delight in reading, and seek- ing the knowledge of all lawfull things; but with these two
 restrictions: first, that yee choose idle houres for it, not interrupting
 therewith the discharge of your office: and next, that yee studie not for knowledge nakedly,
 but that your princi- pall ende be, to make you able thereby to vse your office; practising according to your knowledge in
 all the points of your calling: not like these vaine Astrolo- gians, that studie night and day
 on the course of the starres, onely that they may, for satisfying their
 curiositie, know their course. But
 since all Artes and sciences are linked euery one with other, their greatest principles
 agreeing in one (which mooued the Poets to faine the nine Muses to be all sisters) studie
 them, that out of their harmonie, ye may sucke the knowledge of all faculties; and
 consequently be on the counsell of all crafts, that yee may be able to containe them all in
 order, as I haue alreadie said: For knowledge and learning is a light burthen, the weight
 whereof will neuer presse your shoulders. 
 First of all then, study to be well seene in the Scriptures, as I remembred you in the first
 booke; as well for the knowledge of your
 owne saluation, as that ye may be able to containe your Church in their calling, as Custos vtriusque Tabulae . For the ruling
 them well, is no small point of your office; taking specially heede, that they vague not from
 their text in the Pulpit: and if euer ye would haue peace in your land, suffer them not to
 meddle in that place with the estate or policie; but punish seuerely the first that presumeth
 to it. Doe nothing towards them without a good ground and warrant, but reason not much with
 them: for I haue ouer- much surfeited them with that, and it is not their fashion to yeeld.
 And suffer no conuentions nor meetings among Church-men, but by your knowledge and permission. 
 Next the Scriptures, studie well your owne Lawes: for how can ye discerne by the thing yee
 know not? But preasse to draw all your Lawes and processes, to be as short and plaine as ye
 can: assure your selfe the longsomnesse both of rights and processes, breedeth their vnsure
 loosenesse and obscuritie, the shortest being euer both the surest and plainest forme, and
 the longsomnesse seruing onely for the enriching of the Aduocates and Clerkes, with the spoile
 of the whole countrey : And therefore delite to haunt your Session, and spie carefully their proceedings;
 taking good heede, if any briberie may be tried among them, which cannot ouer seuerely be
 punished. Spare not to goe there, for gracing that farre any that yee fauour, by your presence
 to procure them expedition of Iustice; although that should be specially done, for the poore
 that cannot waite on, or are debarred by mightier parties. But when yee are there, remember
 the throne is Gods and not yours, that ye sit in, and let no fauour, nor whatsoeuer respects
 mooue you from the right. Ye sit not there, as I shewe before, for rewarding of friends or
 seruants, nor for crossing of contemners, but onely for doing of Iustice. Learne
 also wisely to discerne betwixt Iustice and equitie; and for pitie of the poore, rob not the
 rich, because he may better spare it, but giue the little man the larger coat if it be his;
 eschewing the errour of young Cyrus therein: For Iustice, by the Law, giueth euery man his owne; and equitie
 in things arbitrall, giueth euery one that which is meetest for him. 
 Be an ordinarie sitter in your secret Counsell: that iudicature is onely ordained for
 matters of estate, and repressing of insolent oppressions. Make that iudge- ment
 as compendious and plaine as ye can; and suffer no Aduocates to be heard there with their
 dilatours, but let euery partie tell his owne tale himselfe: and wearie not to heare the
 complaints of the oppressed, aut ne Rex
 sis . Remit euery thing to the ordinary iudicature, for eschewing of confusion: but
 let it be your owne craft, to take a sharpe account of euery man in his office. 
 And next the Lawes, I would haue you to be well versed in authentick histories, and in the
 Chronicles of all nations, but specially in our owne histories ( Ne sis peregrinus domi ) the example whereof most neerely
 concernes you: I meane not of such infamous inuectiues, as Buchanans or
 Knoxes Chronicles: and if any of these infamous libels remaine vntill
 your dayes, vse the Law vpon the keepers thereof: For in that point I would haue you a
 Pythagorist, to thinke that the
 very spirits of these archibellouses of rebellion, haue made transition in them that hoardes
 their bookes, or maintaines their opinions; punishing them, euen as it were their authours
 risen againe. But by reading of authenticke histories and Chronicles, yee shall
 learne experience by Theoricke, applying the bypast things to the present estate, quia nihil nouum sub sole : such is the continuall volubilitie of things
 earthly, according to the roundnesse of the world, and reuolution of the, heauenly circles:
 which is expressed by the wheeles in Ezechiels visions, and counterfeited by the Poets in rota Fortunae . And likewise by the knowledge of histories, yee shall
 knowe how to behaue your selfe to all Embassadours and strangers; being able to discourse with
 them vpon the estate of their owne coun- trey. And among al prophane histories, I must not
 omit most specially to recom- mend vnto you, the Commentaries of Caesar ; both for the sweete flowing of the stile, as also for the worthinesse of the
 matter it selfe: For I haue euer beene of that opinion, that of all the Ethnick Emperors, or
 great Captaines that euer were, he hath farthest excelled, both in his practise, and in his
 precepts in martiall affaires. 
 As for the studie of other liberall artes and sciences, I would haue you reason- ably versed
 in them, but not preassing to bee a passe-master in any of them: for that cannot but distract
 you from the points of your calling, as I shewed you be- fore: and when, by the enemie winning the towne, yee shall bee
 interrupted in your demonstration, as Archimedes 
 was; your people (I
 thinke) will looke very bluntly vpon it. I graunt it is meete yee haue some entrance,
 specially in the Mathematickes; for the knowledge of the arte militarie, in situation of
 Campes, ordering of battels, making Fortifications, placing of batteries, or such like. And let not this your
 knowledge be dead without fruites, as Saint Iames speaketh of Faith: but let it appeare in
 your daily conuersation, and in all the actions of your life. 
 
 
 Embrace trew magnanimitie, not in beeing vindictiue, which the corrupted iudgements of the
 world thinke to be trew Magnanimitie; but by the contrarie, in thinking your offendour not worthie of your wrath,
 empyring ouer your owne passion, and triumphing in the commaunding your selfe to forgiue:
 husbanding the effects
 of your courage and wrath, to be rightly employed vpon repelling of iniuries within, by
 reuenge taking vpon the oppressours; and in reuenging iniuries without, by iust warres vpon
 forraine enemies. And so, where ye finde a notable iniurie, spare not to giue course to the
 torrents of your wrath. The wrath of a King, is like to the roaring of a
 Lyon. 
 
 Foster trew Humilitie, in bannishing pride, not onely towards God (consider- ing yee differ
 not in stuffe, but in vse, and that onely by his ordinance, from the basest of your people)
 but also towards your Parents. And if it fall out that my Wife shall out-liue me, as euer ye
 thinke to purchase my blessing, honour your mother: set Beersheba in a
 throne on your right hand: offend her for nothing, much lesse wrong her: remember her Quae longa decem tulerit fastidia
 menses; and that your flesh and blood is made of hers: and beginne not,
 like the young lordes and lairdes, your first warres vpon your Mother; but presse earnestly to
 deserue her blessing. Neither deceiue your selfe with many that say, they care not for their
 Parents curse, so they deserue it not. 0 inuert not the order of nature, by iudging your
 superiours, chiefly in your owne particular! But assure your selfe, the blessing or curse of
 the Parents, hath almost euer a Propheticke power ioyned with it: and if there were no more,
 honour your Parents, for the lengthning of your owne dayes, as GOD in his Law promiseth. Honour also them that are in loco Parentum vnto you, such as your
 gouernours, vp-bringers, and Praeceptours: be thankefull vnto them and reward them, which is your dewtie and honour. 
 But on the other part, let not this trew humilitie stay your high indignation to appeare,
 when any great oppressours shall presume to come in your presence; then frowne as ye ought: And in-case thay vse a colour
 of Law in oppressing their poore ones, as ouer-many doe, that which ye cannot mend by Law,
 mend by the withdrawing of your countenance from them: and once in the yeere crosse them, when their erands come in your way,
 recompencing the oppressour, according to Christs parable of the two debtours. 
 
 Keepe trew Constancie, not onely in your kindenesse towards honest men; but being also inuicti animi against all aduersities:
 not with that Stoicke insensi- ble stupiditie, wherewith many in our dayes, preassing to winne
 honour, in imitat- ing that ancient sect, by their inconstant behauiour in their owne liues,
 belie their profession. But although ye are not a stocke, not
 to feele calamities; yet let not the feeling of them, so ouer-rule and doazen your reason, as
 may stay you from taking and vsing the best resolution for remedie, that can be found out. 
 Vse trew Liberalitie in rewarding the good, and bestowing frankly for your honour and weale:
 but with that proportionall discretion, that euery man may be serued according to his measure,
 wherein respect must be had to his ranke, deserts, and necessitie: And prouide how to haue,
 but cast not away without cause. In speciall, empaire not by your Liberalitie the ordinarie
 rents of your crowne; whereby the estate Royall of you, and your successours, must be main-
 tained, ne exhauriasfontem
 liberalitatis : for that would euer be kept sacrosanctum & extra commercium : otherwaies, your
 Liberalitie would decline to Prodigalitie, in helping others with your, and your successours
 hurt. And aboue all, enrich not your selfe with exactions vpon your subiects; but thinke the
 riches of your people your best treasure, by the sinnes of offenders, where no praeuention can
 auaile, making iustly your commoditie. And in-case necessitie of warres, or other extraordinaries
 compell you to lift Subsidies, doe it as rarely as ye can: employing it onely to the vse it
 was ordained for; and vsing your selfe in that case, as fidus depositarius to your people. 
 
 And principally, exercise trew Wisedome; in discerning wisely betwixt trew and false
 reports: First, considering the nature of the person reporter; Next, what entresse he can haue
 in the weale or euill of him, of whom hee maketh the report; Thirdly, the likely-hood of the
 purpose it selfe; And, last, the nature and by-past life of the dilated person: and where yee
 finde a tratler, away with him. And although it bee true, that a
 Prince can neuer without secrecie doe great things, yet it is better ofttimes to try reports,
 then by credulitie to foster suspicion vpon an honest man. For since suspition is the Tyrants
 sickenesse, as the fruites of an euill Conscience, potius in alteram partem peccato : I meane, in not mistrusting one, whom-to no such vnhonestie was
 knowne before. But as for such as haue slipped before, former experience may iustly breed
 praeuention by fore-sight. 
 And to conclude my aduice anent your behauiour in your person; consider that GOD is the
 authour of all vertue, hauing imprinted in mens mindes by the very light of nature, the loue
 of all morall vertues; as was seene by the vertuous liues of the old Romanes : and preasse then to shine as farre before your people, in all vertue and
 honestie; as in greatnesse of ranke: that the vse thereof in all your actions, may turne, with
 time, to a naturall habitude in you; and as by their hearing of your Lawes, so by their sight
 of your person, both their eyes and their eares, may leade and allure them to the loue of
 vertue, and hatred of vice.

OF A KINGS BEHAVIOVR IN INDIFFERENT THINGS. 
 The Third Booke . 
 IT is a trew old saying, That a King is as one set on a stage, whose smallest actions and
 gestures, all the people gazingly doe behold: and therefore although a King be neuer so praecise in the
 discharging of his Office, the people, who seeth but the outward part, will euer iudge of the
 substance, by the circumstances; and
 according to the outward appearance, if his behauiour bee light or dissolute, will conceiue
 prae-occupied conceits of the Kings inward intention: which although with time, (the trier of
 all trewth,) it will euanish, by the euidence of the contrary effects, yet interim patitur iustus ; and praeiudged conceits
 will, in the meane time, breed contempt, the mother of rebellion and disorder. And besides that, it is certaine, that all
 the indifferent actions and behauiour of a man, haue a certaine holding and dependance, either
 vpon vertue or vice, according as they are vsed or ruled: for there is not a middes betwixt them, no more then
 betwixt their rewards, heauen and hell. 
 Be carefull then, my Sonne, so to frame all your indifferent actions and out- ward
 behauiour, as they may serue for the furtherance and forth-setting of your inward vertuous
 disposition. 
 The whole indifferent actions of a man, I deuide in two sorts: in his behauiour in things
 necessary, as food, sleeping, raiment, speaking, writing, and gesture; and in things not
 necessary, though conuenient and lawfull, as pastimes or exer- cises, and vsing of company for
 recreation. 
 As to the indifferent things necessary, although that of themselues they can- not bee
 wanted, and so in that case are not indifferent; as likewise in-case they bee not vsed with
 moderation, declining so to the extremitie, which is vice; yet the qualitie and forme of vsing
 them, may smell of vertue or vice, and be great furtherers to any of them. 
 To beginne then at the things necessarie; one of the publickest indifferent actions of a
 King, and that maniest, especially strangers, will narrowly take heed to; is his maner of
 refection at his Table, and his behauiour thereat. Therefore, as Kings vse oft to eate
 publickly, it is meete and honourable that ye also doe so, as well to eschew the opinion that
 yee loue not to haunt companie, which is one of the markes of a Tyrant; as likewise, that your delight to eate priuatlie, be not
 thought to be for private satisfying of your gluttonie; which ye would be ashamed should bee
 publicklie seene. Let your Table bee honourably serued; but serue your appetite with few
 dishes, as yong Cyrus did: which both is holesommest, and freest from the vice of delicacie, which is a
 degree of gluttonie. And vse most to
 eate of reasonablie-grosse, and common-meates; aswell for making your bodie
 strong and durable for trauell at all occasions, either in peace or in warre: as that yee may
 bee the heartlier receiued by your meane Subiects in their houses, when their cheare may
 suffice you: which otherwayes would be imputed to you for pride and daintinesse, and breed
 coldnesse and disdaine in them. Let all your food bee simple, without composition or sauces;
 which are more like medecines then meate. The vsing of them was counted amongst the ancient Romanes a 
 filthie vice of delicacie; because they serue onely for pleasing of the taste, and not for
 satisfying of the necessitie of nature; abhorring Apicius their owne citi-
 zen, for his vice of delicacie and monsterous gluttonie. Like as both the Grecians and Romanes had in detestation the very name of Philoxenus , for
 his filthie wish of a Crane-craig. And therefore was that sentence vsed amongst them, against
 these artificiall false appetites, optimum
 condimentum fames . But beware
 with vsing excesse of meat and drinke; and chiefly, beware of drunkennesse, which is a
 beastlie vice, namely in a King: but specially beware with it, because it is one of those
 vices that increaseth with aage. In the forme of your meate-eating, bee neither vnciuill, like
 a grosse Cynicke; nor affectatlie mignarde, like a daintie dame; but eate in a manlie, round,
 and honest fashion. It is no wayes
 comely to dispatch affaires, or to be pensiue at meate: but keepe then an open and cheere-
 full countenance, causing to reade pleasant histories vnto you, that profite may be mixed with
 pleasure: and when ye are not disposed, entertaine pleasant, quicke, but honest discourses. 
 And because meat prouoketh sleeping, be also moderate in your sleepe; for it goeth much by use: and remember that if your whole
 life were deuided in four parts, three of them would be found to be consumed on meat, drinke,
 sleepe, and vnnecessarie occupations. 
 But albeit ordinarie times would commonly bee kept in meate and sleepe, yet vse your selfe
 some-times so, that any time in the foure and twentie houres may bee alike to you for any of
 them; that thereby your diet may be accommodate to your affaires, and not your affaires to
 your diet: not therefore vsing your
 selfe to ouer great softnesse and delicacie in your sleepe, more then in your meate; and
 specially in-case yee haue adoe with the warres. 
 Let not your Chalmer be throng and common in the time of your rest, aswell for comelinesse
 as for eschewing of carrying reports out of the same. Let them that haue the credite to serue
 in your Chalmer, be trustie and secret; for a King will haue need to vse secrecie in may
 things : but yet behaue your selfe so
 in your greatest secrets, as yee neede not bee ashamed, suppose they were all proclaimed at
 the mercate crosse: But specially see
 that those of your Chalmer be of a sound fame, and without blemish. 
 
 Take no heede to any of your dreames, for all prophecies, visions, and prophet- icke dreames
 are accomplished and ceased in Christ: And therefore take no heede to freets either in
 dreames, or any other things; for that errour proceedeth of ignorance, and is vnworthy of a
 Christian, who should be assured, Omnia esse pura
 puris , as Paul sayth; all dayes and meates being alike to Christians. 
 Next followeth to speake of raiment, the on-putting whereof is the ordinarie action that
 followeth next to sleepe. Be also
 moderate in your raiment, neither ouer superfluous, like a deboshed waster; nor yet ouer base,
 like a miserable wretch; not artificially trimmed and decked, like a Courtizane, nor yet ouer
 sluggishly clothed, like a countrey clowne, not ouer lightly like a Candie souldier or a vaine
 young Courtier; nor yet ouer grauely, like a Minister: but in your garments be proper,
 cleanely, comely and honest, wearing your clothes in a care- lesse, yet comely forme: keeping
 in them a middle forme, inter Togatos & Palu-
 datos , betwixt the
 grauitie of the one and lightnesse of the other: thereby to signifie, that by your calling yee
 are mixed of both the professions; Togatus , as a Iudge making and
 pronouncing the Law; 
 Paludatus , by the power of the sword: as your office is likewise mixed,
 betwixt the Ecclesiasticall and ciuill estate: For a King is not mer√® laicus , as both the Papists and Anabaptists would
 haue him, to the which error also the Puritanes incline ouer farre. But to returne to the
 purpose of garments, they ought to be vsed according to their first institu- tion by God,
 which was for three causes: first to hide our nakednesse and shame; next and consequently, to
 make vs more comely, and thirdly, to preserue vs from the iniuries of heate and colde. If to
 hide our nakednesse and shamefull parts, then these naturall parts ordained to be hid, should
 not be represented by any vndecent formes in the cloathes: and if they should helpe our
 comelinesse, they should not then by their painted preened fashion, serue for baites to
 filthie lecherie, as false haire and fairding does amongst vnchast women: and if they should
 preserue vs from the iniuries of heat and colde, men should not, like sense- lesse stones,
 contemne God, in lightlying the seasons, glorying to conquere honour on heate and colde. And
 although it be praise-worthy and necessarie in a Prince, to be patiens algoris & aestus , when he shall haue adoe with
 warres vpon the fields; yet I thinke it meeter that ye goe both cloathed and armed, then naked
 to the battell, except you would make you light for away-running: and yet for cowards, metus addit alas . And shortly, in your cloathes keepe a proportion, aswell
 with the seasons of the yeere, as of your aage: in the fashions of them being carelesse, vsing
 them according to the common forme of the time, some-times richlier, some-times meanlier
 cloathed, as occasion serueth, without keeping any precise rule therein: For if your mind be found occupied vpon them, it wil be
 thought idle otherwaies, and ye shall bee accounted in the number of one of these compti iuuenes ; which wil make your spirit and iudgment to be lesse thought
 of. But specially eschew to be effeminate in your cloathes, in perfuming,
 preening, or such like: and faile neuer in time of warres to bee galliardest and brauest, both
 in cloathes and countenance. And make not a foole of yourselfe in disguising or wearing long
 haire or nailes, which are but excrements, of nature, and bewray such misusers of them, to bee
 either of a vindictiue, or a vaine light naturall. Especially, make no vowes in such vaine and
 outward things, as concerne either meate or cloathes. 
 Let your selfe and all your Court weare no ordinarie armour with your cloathes, but such as
 is knightly and honourable; I meane rapier-swordes, and daggers: For tuilyesome weapons in the
 Court, betokens confusion in the countrey. And therefore bannish not onely from your Court,
 all traiterous offensiue weapons, forbidden by the Lawes, as guns and such like (whereof I
 spake alreadie) but also all traiterous defensiue armes, as secrets, plate-sleeues, and such
 like vnseene armour: For, besides that the wearers thereof, may be presupposed to haue a
 secret euill intention, they want both the vses that defensiue armour is ordained for; which
 is, to be able to holde out violence, and by their outward glaunsing in their enemies eyes, to
 strike a terrour in their hearts: Where by the contrary, they can serue for neither, being not
 onely vnable to resist, but dangerous for shots, and gluing no outward showe against the
 enemie; beeing onely ordained, for betraying vnder trust, whereof honest men should be ashamed
 to beare the outward badge, not resembling the thing they are not. And for answere against
 these arguments, I know none but the olde Scots fashion; which if it be wrong, is no more to
 be allowed for ancientnesse, then the olde Masse is, which also our forefathers vsed. 
 The next thing that yee haue to take heed to, is your speaking and language; whereunto I
 ioyne your gesture, since action is one of the chiefest qualities, that is required in an
 oratour: for as the tongue
 speaketh to the eares, so doeth the gesture speake to the eyes of the auditour. In both your
 speaking and your gesture, vse a nturall and plaine forme, not fairded with artifice: for (as the French-men say) Rien contre-faict fin : but eschew all
 affectate formes in both. 
 In your language be plaine, honest, naturall, comely, cleane, short, and senten- tious,
 eschewing both the extremities, aswell in not vsing any rusticall corrupt leide, as
 booke-language, and pen and inke-horne termes: and least of all mi- gnard and effoeminate tearmes. But let the greatest part of
 your eloquence consist in a naturall, cleare, and sensible forme of the deliuerie of your
 minde, builded euer vpon certaine and good grounds; tempering it with grauitie, quickenesse, or merinesse,
 according to the subiect, and occasion of the time; not taunting in Theologie, nor alleadging
 and prophaning the Scripture in drinking purposes, as ouer many doe. 
 
 Vse also the like forme in your gesture; neither looking sillily, like a stupide pedant;
 nor vnsetledly, with an vncouth
 morgue, like a new-comeouer Cavalier: but let your behauiour be naturall, graue, and according
 to the fashion of the countrey. Be not
 ouer-sparing in your courtesies, for that will be imputed to inciuilitie and arrogancie: nor yet ouer prodigall in iowking or
 nodding at euery step: for that forme of being popular, becommeth better aspiring Absalons , then lawfull Kings: framing euer your gesture according to your present actions: looking grauely and with a maiestie when yee
 sit in iudgement, or giue audience to Embassadours, homely, when ye are in priuate with your
 owne seruants; merily, when ye are at any pastime or merrie discourse; and let your
 countenance smell of courage and magnanimitie when ye are at the warres. And remember (I say
 ouer againe) to be plaine and sensible in your language: for besides that it is the tongues office, to be the
 messenger of the mind, it may be thought a point of imbecillitie of spirit in a King, to
 speake obscurely, much more vntrewly; as if he stood in awe of any in vttering his
 thoughts. 
 
 Remember also, to put a difference betwixt your forme of language in reason- ing, and your
 pronouncing of sentences, or declaratour of your wil in iudgement, or any other waies in the
 points of your office For in the former
 case, yee must reason pleasantly and patiently, not like a king, but like a priuate man and a
 scholer; otherwaies, your impatience of contradiction will be interpreted to be for lacke of
 reason on your part. Where in the points of your office, ye should ripely aduise indeede,
 before yee giue foorth your sentence: but fra it be giuen foorth, the suffering of any
 contradiction diminisheth the maiestie of your au- thoritie, and maketh the processes
 endelsse . The like forme would also
 bee ob- serued by all your inferiour Iudges and Magistrates. 
 
 Now as to your writing, which is nothing else, but a forme of en-registrate speech; vse a
 plaine, short, but stately stile, both in your Proclamations and missiues, especially to
 forraine Princes. And if your engine spur you to write any workes, either in verse or in
 prose, I cannot but allow you to practise it: but take no longsome workes in hand, for
 distracting you from your calling. 
 Flatter not your selfe in your labours, but before they bee set foorth, let them first bee
 priuily censured by some of the best skilled men in that craft, that in these workes yee
 meddle with. And because your writes
 will remaine as true pictures of your minde, to all posterities; let them bee free of all
 vncomelinesse and vn-honestie: and according to Horace his counsell - Nonumquam premantur in
 annum. 
 I meane both your verse and your prose; letting first that furie and heate,
 wherewith they were written, coole at leasure; and then as an vncouth iudge. and censour,
 reuising them ouer againe, before they bee published, - quia nescit vox missa
 reuerti . 
 If yee would write worthily, choose subiects worthie of you, that bee not full of vanitie,
 but of vertue; eschewing obscuritie, and delighting euer to bee plaine and sensible. And if
 yee write in verse, remember that it is not the principal part of a Poeme to rime right, and
 flowe well with many pretie wordes: but the chiefe commendation of a Poeme is, that when the
 verse shall bee shaken sundrie in prose, it shall bee found so rich in quicke inuentions, and
 poeticke flowers, and in faire and pertinent comparisons; as it shall retaine the lustre of a
 Poeme, although in prose. And I
 would also aduise you to write in your owne language: for there is nothing left to be saide in
 Greeke and Latine alreadie; and ynew of poore schollers would match you in these languages;
 and besides that, it best becommeth a King to purifie and make famous his owne tongue; wherein
 he may goe before all his subjects; as it setteth him well to doe in all honest and lawfull
 things. 
 And amongst all vnnecessarie things that are lawfull and expedient, I thinke exercises of
 the bodie most commendable to be vsed by a young Prince, in such honest games or pastimes, as
 may further abilitie and maintaine health: For albeit I graunt it to be most requisite for a King to exercise his engine,
 which surely with idlenesse will ruste and become blunt; yet certainely bodily exercises and
 games are very commendable; as well
 for bannishing of idlenesse (the mother of all vice) as for making his bodie able and durable
 for trauell, which is very necessarie for a King. But from this count I debarre all rough and violent exercises, as the
 footeball; meeter for laming, then making able the vsers thereof: as likewise such tumbling trickes as only serue for
 Comoedians and Balladines, to win their bread with. But the exercises that I would haue you to
 vse (although but moderately, not making a craft of them) are running, leaping, wrastling,,
 fencing, dancing, and playing at the caitch or tennise, archerie, palle maille, and such like
 other faire and pleasant field-games. And
 the honourablest and most commendable games that yee can vse, are on horsebacke: for it becommeth a Prince best of any man,
 to be a faire and good horse-man. Vse
 therefore to ride and danton great and couragious horses; that I may say of you, as Philip said of great Alexander his sonne, *Makedoni/a ou) se xwrei= . And specially vse such games on horse-backe, as may teach you to handle your
 armes thereon; such as the tilt, the ring, and low-riding for handling of your sword. 
 I cannot omit heere the hunting, namely with running hounds; which is the most honourable
 and noblest sorte thereof: for it is a theeuish forme of hunting to shoote with
 gunnes and bowes; and greyhound hunting is not so martiall a game: But because I would not be
 thought a partiall praiser of this sport, I remit you to Xenophon, an
 olde and famous writer, who had no minde of flatter- ing you or me in this purpose: and who
 also setteth downe a faire paterne, for the education of a yong king, vnder the supposed name
 of Cyrus. 
 
 As for hawking I condemne it not, but I must praise it more sparingly, because it neither
 resembleth the warres so neere as hunting doeth, in making a man hardie, and skilfully ridden
 in all grounds, and is more vncertaine and subiect to mischances; and (which is worst of all)
 is therethrough an extreme stirrer vp of passions: But in vsing either of these games, obserue
 that moderation, that ye slip not therewith the houres appointed for your affaires, which ye
 ought euer precisely to keepe; 
 remembring that these games are but ordained for you, in enabling you for your office, for the
 which ye are ordained. 
 And as for sitting house-pastimes, wherewith men by driuing time, spurre a free and fast
 ynough running horse (as the prouerbe is) although they are not profitable for the exercise
 either of minde or body, yet can I not
 vtterly condemne them; since they may at times supply the roome, which being emptie, would be
 patent to pernicious idlenesse, quia nihil potest
 esse vacuum . 5 I
 will not there- fore agree with the curiositie of some learned men in our aage, in forbidding
 cardes, dice, and other such like games of hazard; although otherwayes surely I reuerence them
 as notable and godly men: For they are deceiued therein, in founding their argument vpon a
 mistaken ground, which is, that the playing at such games, is a kind of casting of lot, and
 therefore vnlawfull; wherein they deceiue themselues: For the casting of lot was vsed for
 triall of the trewth in any obscure thing, that otherwayes could not be gotten cleared; and
 therefore was a sort of prophecie: where by the contrary, no man goeth to any of these playes,
 to cleare any obscure trewth, but onely to gage so much of his owne money, as hee pleaseth,
 vpon the hazard of the running of the cardes or dice, aswell as he would doe vpon the speede
 of a horse or a dog, or any such like gaigeour: And so, if they be vnlawfull, all gaigeours
 vpon vncertainties must likewayes be condemned: Not that thereby I take the defence of vaine
 carders and dicers, that waste their moyen, and their time (whereof fewe consider the
 pretiousnesse) vpon prodigall and continuall playing: no, I would rather allow it to be discharged, where such corruption can- not
 be eschewed. But only I cannot condemne you at some times, when ye haue no other thing adoe
 (as a good King will be seldome) and are wearie of reading, or euill disposed in your person,
 and when it is foule and stormie weather; then, I say, may ye lawfully play at the cardes or
 tables: For as to dicing, I thinke it becommeth best deboshed souldiers to play at, on the
 head of their drums, being onely ruled by hazard, and subiect to knauish cogging. And as for
 the chesse, I thinke it ouer fond, because it is ouer-wise and Philosophicke a folly. For
 where all such light playes, are ordained to free mens heads for a time, from the
 fashious thoughts on their affaires; it by the contrarie filleth and troubleth mens heads,
 with as many fashious toyes of the play, as before it was filled with thoughts on his
 affaires. 
 But in your playing, I would haue you to keepe three rules: first, or ye play, consider yee
 doe it onely for your recreation, and resolue to hazard the losse of all that ye play; and
 next, for that cause play no more then yee care to cast among Pages: and last, play alwaies
 faire play precisely, that ye come not in vse of tricking and lying in ieast: otherwise, if
 yee cannot keepe these rules, my coun- sell is that yee allutterly abstaine from these playes:
 For neither a madde passion for losse, nor falshood vsed for desire of gaine, can be called a
 play. 
 Now, it is not onely lawfull, but necessarie, that yee haue companie meete for euery thing
 yee take on hand, as well in your games and exercises, as in your graue and earnest affaires:
 But learne to distinguish time according to the oc- casion, choosing your companie
 accordingly. Conferre
 not with hunters at your counsell, nor in your counsell affaires: nor dispatch not affaires at
 hunting or other games. And haue the like respect to the seasons of your aage, vsing your
 sortes of recreation and companie therefore, agreeing thereunto: For it becom- meth best, as
 kindliest, euery aage to smell of their owne qualitie, insolence and vnlawful things beeing
 alwaies eschewed: and not that a
 colt should draw the plough, and an olde horse run away with the harrowes. But take heede
 specially, that your companie for recreation, be chosen of honest persons, not defamed or
 vicious, mixing filthie talke with merrinesse, Corrumpunt bonos mores colloquia praua. And
 chiefly abstaine from haunting before your mariage, the idle companie of dames, which are
 nothing else, but irritamenta
 libidinis . Bee warre likewaies to abuse your selfe, in making your sporters
 your counsellers: and delight not to keepe ordinarily in your companie, Comoedians or
 Balladines: for the Tyrans delighted most in them, glorying to bee both authors and
 actors of Comoedies and Tragedies themselues: Whereupon the answere that the poet Philoxenus dis- dainfully gaue to the Tyran of Syracuse there-anent, is now come in a prouerbe, reduc me in latomias . And all the ruse that Nero made of himselfe when he
 died, was Qualis artifex pereo ? meaning of his skill in menstrally, and
 playing of Tragoedies; as indeede his whole life and death, was all but one Tragoedie. 
 Delight not also to bee in your owne person a player vpon instruments; especially on such as
 commonly men winne their liuing with: nor yet to be fine of any mechanicke craft: Leur esprit s'en fuit au bout des doigts ,
 saith Du Bartas : 
 whose workes, as they are all most worthie to bee read by any Prince, or other 
 spare not some-times by merie company, to be free from importunitie; for ye should be euer
 mooued with reason, which is the onely qualitie whereby men differ from beasts; and not with
 importunitie: For the which cause (as
 also for augmenting your Maiestie) ye shall not be so facile of accesse-giuing at all times,
 as I haue beene; and yet not altogether retired or locked vp, like the
 Kings of Persia ; appointing also certaine houres for publicke
 audience. 
 
 And since my trust is, that God hath ordained you for moe Kingdomes then this (as I haue oft
 alreadie said) preasse by the outward behauiour as well of your owne person, as of your court,
 in all indifferent things, to allure piece and piece, the rest of your kingdomes, to follow
 the fashions of that kingdome of yours, that yee finde most ciuill, easiest to be ruled, and
 most obedient to the Lawes: for these outward and indifferent things will serue greatly for
 allurements to the people, to embrace and follow vertue. But beware of thrawing or
 constraining them thereto; letting it bee brought on with time, and at leisure; specially by
 so mixing through alliance and daily conuersation, the inhabitants of euery kingdom with
 other, as may with time make them to grow and welde all in one: Which may easily be done
 betwixt these two nations, being both but one Ile of Britaine , and
 alreadie ioyned in vnitie of Religion and language. So that euen as in the times of our
 ancestours, the long warres and many bloodie battels be- twixt these two countreys, bred a
 naturall and hereditarie hatred in euery of them, against the other: the vniting and welding
 of them hereafter in one, by all sort of friendship, commerce, and alliance, will by the
 contrary produce and maintaine a naturall and inseparable vnitie of loue amongst them. As we
 haue already (praise be to God) a great experience of the good beginning hereof, and of the
 quenching of the olde hate in the hearts of both the people; procured by the meanes of this
 long and happy amitie, betweene the Queene my dearest sister and me; which during the whole
 time of both our Reignes, hath euer beene inuiolably obserued. 
 And for conclusion of this my whole Treatise, remember my Sonne, by your trew and constant
 depending vpon God, to looke for a blessing to all your actions in your office: by the outward
 vsing thereof, to testifie the inward vprightnesse of your heart; and by your behauiour in all
 indifferent things, to set foorth the viue image of your vertuous disposition; and in respect
 of the greatnesse and weight of your burthen, to be patient in hearing, keeping your heart
 free from praeoccupation, ripe in concluding, and constant in your resolution: For better it is to bide at your resolution,
 although there were some defect in it, then by daily changing, to effectuate nothing: taking the paterne thereof from the mi-
 crocosme of your owne body; wherein ye haue two eyes, signifying great foresight and
 prouidence, with a narrow looking in all things; and also two eares, signify- ing patient
 hearing, and that of both the parties: but ye haue but one tongue, for pronouncing a plaine,
 sensible, and vniforme sentence; and but one head, and one heart, for keeping a
 constant & vniforme resolution, according to your appre- hension: hauing two hands and two
 feete, with many fingers and toes for quicke execution, in employing all instruments meet for
 effectuating your deliberations. 
 But forget not to digest euer your passion, before ye determine vpon any- thing, since Ira furor breuis est : vttering onely your anger according
 to the Apostles rule, Irascimini, sed ne
 peccetis : taking
 pleasure, not only to reward, but to aduance the good, which is a chiefe point of a Kings
 glory (but make none ouer-great, but according as the power of the countrey may beare) and
 punishing the euill; but euery man according to his owne offence: not punish- ing nor blaming the father for the sonne, nor
 the brother for the brother; much lesse
 generally to hate a whole race for the fault of one: for noxa caput sequitur . 
 
 And aboue all, let the measure of your loue to euery one, be according to the measure of his
 vertue; letting your fauour to be no longer tyed to any, then the continuance of his vertuous
 disposition shall deserue: not admitting the excuse vpon a iust reuenge, to procure ouersight
 to an iniurie: For the first iniurie is committed against the partie; but the parties
 reuenging thereof at his owne hand, is a wrong committed against you, in vsurping your office,
 whom-to onely the sword belongeth, for reuenging of all the iniuries committed against any of
 your people. 
 Thus hoping in the goodnes of God, that your naturall inclination shall haue a happy
 sympathie with these precepts, making the wise-mans scholemaster, which is the example of
 others, to bee your teacher, according to that old verse, Faelix quem faciunt aliena pericula
 cautum; eschewing so the ouer-late repentance by your owne experience,
 which is the schoole-master of fooles; I wil for end of all, require you my Sonne, as euer ye
 thinke to deserue my fatherly blessing, to keepe continually before the eyes of your minde,
 the greatnesse of your charge: making
 the faithfull and due dis- charge thereof, the principal butt ye shoot at in all your
 actions: counting it euer the
 principall, and all your other actions but as accessories, to be emploied as middesses for the
 furthering of that principall. And being content to let others excell in other things, let it
 be your chiefest earthly glory, to excell in your owne craft: according to the worthy counsel
 and charge of Anchises to his pos- teritie, in that sublime and
 heroicall Poet, wherein also my dicton is included;

 
 
 
 Excudent alij spirantia mollius aera, 
 Credo equidem, & viuos ducent de marmore vultus, 
 Orabunt causas melius, caelique meatus 
 Describent radio, & surgentia sydera dicent. 
 Tu; regere imperio populos, Romane, memento 
 (Hae tibi erunt artes) pacique imponere morem, 
 "Parcere subiectis, & debellare superbos. 
 
 Virg 6. AEn.
